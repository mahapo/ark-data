>> Ask yourself the following
question, how do I move?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
All movement takes place in
the mind first, then the brain,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and then the body.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:10%
I am Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:10%
And my research and
experiences in the practice

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
of energetic medicine
over the last 40 years

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:10%
has revealed a lot of
valuable information

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:10%
on how we change
from a healthy state

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:10%
to an unhealthy state of being.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
My lifelong study of
yoga and martial arts

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:84%
has produced some
insights that I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
think you will find
helpful in discovering

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.600 align:middle line:84%
your own methods of becoming
healthy and staying that way.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Yoga and martial arts both
use movement and the study

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of movement to produce
not just physical fitness,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
but also a healthy
state of mind.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we'll explore
movement and your mind.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.609 align:middle line:90%


00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:25.599 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
An important understanding in
the practice of energy medicine

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.365 align:middle line:84%
is that all problems
are energetic problems.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
What is an energetic problem?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:10%
It is something that is
happening that you internally

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:10%
support.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
When this occurs, you do
not have enough energy

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
or information to create
or achieve a resolution.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that parts
of your energetic field become

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
blocked or absent, which causes
a loss of form or function.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
A loss of form would be physical
illness, and a loss of function

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
would be things that prevent you
from moving, like depression,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:90%
anxiety, guilt, shame.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So how do we create energy to
find or seek information that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%
would achieve a resolution?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
In my work, I would
attribute this to movement.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Movement produces change.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Mentally, it is a change of
perspective or observation.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Physically, it produces
energy flow through the body.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
This energy flow helps
create an awakening

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.215 align:middle line:90%
in your present reality.

00:02:59.215 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Energy movement can be
anything from qigong

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to boxing, to
swimming, to running.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of movement increases
your breathing oxygen,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and also increases the amount
of energy available to the body.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
The way to break
out of your patterns

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:90%
is to find a way to move.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.835 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
There are two
aspects of reality--

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
zero reality and
number one reality.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality is
experiential reality.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And physical reality
is number one.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
In number one reality, we
create physical movement.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And through that number
one reality movement,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
we produce energy to
move into zero reality.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality is where we
create, and that is also

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%
where we examine ourselves.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't have
the energy to do that,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
we cannot perform this
changing function.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So when mental
movement happens, it

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:84%
can have the reverse effect
which changes the physical body

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Martial arts, yoga,
and other disciplines

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
aim to produce a more
energetic nature.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And a more energetic
nature allows

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
you to become healthier,
happier, and successful.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Of all the problems that
exists in life, all of them

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
can be addressed more
efficiently with more energy.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into the
physical body itself.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:10%
One of the things we
might look at first

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:10%
is the expressions of
anxiety and depression.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:84%
As you go through
life, you have a lot

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
of ways to respond to the
circumstances and environments

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.460 align:middle line:90%
you experience.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety and depression are
some of those expressions.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:90%
But what really goes on?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
You have energy in your body.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You have energy
along your spine.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
That energy flows up
and down the spine,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and it also energizes
different functions and forms

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
There's an area
of the brain that

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
produces neurochemistry,
the outcome of which we

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%
call anxiety.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the same
fashion, there's an area

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that produces the
neurochemical expressions that

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
form depression.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So each of those is
activated by energy flow.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
If you direct energy to those
portions of the brain that

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
produces neurochemistry,
then your experience

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
of what is going on
around you is the outcome

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
of anxiety or depression.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
In modern medicine, when
you take anti-anxiety pills

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
or anti-depression
pills, what you're doing

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:90%
is not stopping the energy flow.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not actually
stopping the production

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.832 align:middle line:84%
of those neurochemical
expressions

00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:03.915 align:middle line:90%
that the body is creating.

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So you have energy that flows
through your genetic templates

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and produces a genetic
expression such as eye

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.300 align:middle line:90%
color or hair color.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.410 align:middle line:84%
The loss of energy flowing
through those genes

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
results in gray hair or no hair.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
This goes for all
cells and organs

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in the body and the
entire human form.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The entire human form is
subjected to the adding

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.555 align:middle line:90%
and subtracting of energy.

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.295 align:middle line:84%
All human functions are
also energetically pliable.

00:07:53.295 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Genes become an interesting
way to look at the human form.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got a million
different options.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
multiplicity of potential,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
and it shows up in the
form you have today.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
That form is an
execution of energy

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:90%
flowing through those genes.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The energy flowing
through that gene

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
determines the extent
of its expression.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at male or
female, around 25 years old,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:90%
they start losing their hair.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well,
that's a genetic issue.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:10%
And it may be a genetic
issue, and the fact

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:10%
that that genetic template
is either insufficient

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:10%
or it has been modified, we
get into epigenetic changes,

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:10%
to where the form doesn't hold.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And we say, well, that's
genes from my parents.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
That is true, except that energy
flow through that template,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
through that gene, can be
increased and can be changed.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I have seen this in
my practice, where

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to change
the gene expression.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
studies that support

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
this, that the genes are
mutable, that they're pliable

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily just the
fixed state you were born in.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:28.236 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
We say that the
human form of you

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:90%
is expressed to its maximum.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:10%
You end up in your full
physical form by the time

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:10%
you're about 18 or 19.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:10%
The amount of energy
that has to be expressed

00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:10%
through all those genes to
create your physical body

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:10%
is infinite.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:10%
It requires the energy
of the universe.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
It requires the energy
of life force itself

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
to be able to form that way.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Most people are born
without too many "defects,"

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%
we would call them.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
For the total
amount of genes you

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.100 align:middle line:84%
have to have
something not formed

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.300 align:middle line:84%
properly is actually
kind of rare.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a human
form, but guess what?

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:90%
It has to function.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
So functionality requires form.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We function really well unless
some of those template forms,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
genes, are damaged,
are weak, and then we

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:90%
start having problems.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So up till about 19
years old, you really

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:90%
don't have any problems.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
You're still being
created, but after 19,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
it's all energetic function--

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
maintenance of the
form of the human body.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Those functions become
interesting because they're

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:90%
operating programs.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:10%
They're like a CPU
in the human body.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They're related to the
brain as the hardware,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're related to your
mind as the software that

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:90%
runs all this.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.730 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting to
me is that software

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:90%
precedes the human form.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:90%
You are born with a personality.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It did not come about
in your physical form.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It came about through
your physical form, which

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
indicates it was pre-existing.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Your personality
drives your functions.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So some people are energetic,
some people or more dormant.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
We express ourselves
across an incredible range

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:90%
of experience and actions.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So human form and
function become something

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:90%
that we notice.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We notice that things
change in our body

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and in our ability to function
and the ability of those organs

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to function.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But all of them can be addressed
and either improved or changed

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:90%
through energetic work.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Our body and its functions
are supported by energy flow.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
All illnesses are
supported by energy flow.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Your immune responses
are energized or not.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The autonomous and
semi-autonomic nervous systems

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
also operate on energy, whether
you are conscious of it or not.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality, the
reality of thought,

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and imagination, and
creative expression

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:90%
takes energy from your system.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Working our physical
movement actually

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
becomes important because
the more you move,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the more you can take on
in number one reality.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
The more energy you
have, the more energetic

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:84%
you are in zero
reality interactions.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
They go back and forth.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
For instance, running
might seem to be depleting

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.280 align:middle line:84%
of your physical
energy, but it actually

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
energizes your energetic field.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And this helps you
mentally process more.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We are encouraging someone
to move and explore movement

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
as a basis for mental health.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.439 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Movement creates energy
through breathing, very simple.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into rhythm.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
When you breathe, the
cilia in your lungs

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
accumulate a static
electric charge--

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
sort of like rubbing
your feet on the carpet.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That charge is then
transferred to storage sites

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
in the form of dense
organs in the body.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe consciously
to develop a charge,

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
you have more battery life.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
This is reflected in
a larger energy field.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
The goal of martial arts is to
become consciously interactive

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
with the human energy
field, and also

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.115 align:middle line:90%
merge zero and one reality.

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:10%
If we go back to
the principles I

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:10%
teach, awareness, balance,
moment, movement, momentum,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:10%
and then your will.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see,
number four movement

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
is that which pushes us through
our problems and, in doing so,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:90%
creates momentum in our will.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Now we are at a point
to create reality.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you break this down,
you wake up in the morning,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
you have awareness that you need
to balance both zero and one

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
reality, you seize the
moment to create movement,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and that drives
momentum to create

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
your free will,
which is the deciding

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:90%
factor on your current reality.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Without movement, we
don't have momentum.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And without momentum, we
can't get to higher states

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.060 align:middle line:90%
of health and consciousness.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:26.964 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.964 --> 00:16:33.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The goal of all movement is to
create energy to be ourselves.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
We are scaling up
an energy flow,

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and that allows us to do more,
learn more, and grow more.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Movement itself is generally
considered an art form.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:10%
We have all manner of
expressions of it--

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:10%
in the form of sports,
in the form of arts,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:10%
from dance to
gymnastics, that movement

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.925 align:middle line:10%
is something we relate to.

00:17:10.925 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's something
we're fascinated by.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, most
people are fascinated

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
by the movement of other
people and our own movement,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
particularly after 19
years old, as something

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:90%
we do less and less.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people carry on their form
of movement, their art form,

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:90%
into their 20s or 30s.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
40s, and 50s, we become
a little less motivated.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Why is that true?

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Internal conflicts and
internal dialogues.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I love the dialogues.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Should I stay or should I go?

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The dialogue is
usually an argument.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It represents being stuck.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety and
depression are a form

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
of being stuck, being
frozen in our consciousness.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The internal conflict
is one of choices.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Every time you get into
an internal conflict,

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
should I wear this, should I
wear that, should I go here,

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
should I order this at the
restaurant, you're losing time.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can get lost in that to
the point we've become frozen.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't move.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
We can even get to a point where
we don't even want to engage,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and we become locked in
not just our own mind,

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we become locked
in our own reality.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And that reality
obviously can be

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.950 align:middle line:84%
one of a negative,
which is depression,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety, or guilt, or shame.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But in the same way, we
can make quick choices

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
that allow us to move.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:04.768 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Movement occurs before
you actually move.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You have become very
exceptional at moving your body

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
without thought.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the movement had
thought prior to the movement.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It had electron flow
prior to the thought.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It had some information
and energy flow before all

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:90%
that happened.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There have been
scientific studies

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that show the distance
between a thought and action.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:84%
It is actually one of the
primary forms of advancement

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:90%
in martial arts--

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to get to a point to where your
thoughts and actions happen

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
really advanced form,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
your actions occur
before you even

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.800 align:middle line:84%
think of them, where
you're actually acting way

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:90%
ahead of your current reality.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:84%

environment you're in.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
We have that ability.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to move
our mind ahead in time.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We usually teach about three
seconds is pretty normal.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
People can actually move ahead
and project movement forward.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
That is momentum.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You can develop through
certain martial arts,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
through certain
meditative techniques,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
yourself forward.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call it.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
You can see yourself forward in
time and also in the movements

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:90%
you need to make.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It is a pretty high
state of momentum,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
because you have already
made all the choices.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
If you create that momentum
and have that ability

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
to be ahead of yourself just
a little bit, what you find

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
is life doesn't have
as many conflicts.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require of
you so many choices,

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
where you get choice burnout.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So choice burnout comes
at the end of the day.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I've already made all my
decisions and somebody goes,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:90%
you want to go eat?

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Where do you want to go?

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, I can't
be picking something.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you just can't
make another choice.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
What that means is you've lost
all momentum in your life.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And it shows, either as
we don't have a choice,

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
or we don't want
to make a choice,

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:84%
because we have
expended all energy.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
I teach is that when

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:10%
you have a moment
between 3:00 and 5:00,

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:10%
5:300 in the
afternoon or evening,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:10%
is to do some breathing
to increase your energy,

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:10%
and also to recharge your
batteries to the point

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:10%
you can go back into a
decision-making mode.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So decision making, which
is a thought process,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.845 align:middle line:90%
takes a lot of energy.

00:22:19.845 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So ideally, in life, you
would get to some point

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to where you don't do
internal conflicts.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You would know that you want
to go to a certain restaurant

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
or that you like
a certain person,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
rather than throw it into a
duality, where you can't really

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:90%
decide which way or the other.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.850 align:middle line:90%
That is limbo land.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.560 align:middle line:84%
That is where you burn off
the greatest amount of energy

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think that you burn

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
of all your energy in
movement during the day

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and you become tired.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:23.440 align:middle line:84%
No, you burn it off
with your brain.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Your brain consumes all this
glucose, and water, oxygen--

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
all manner of things
in order to function.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And your mind is pushing
information and energy

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
through your brain
and into your body.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And if there are conflicts,
everything gets backed up.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
blocked, not knowing

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.080 align:middle line:84%
that to take a moment
to actually increase

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the amount of energy
in our body itself

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and then to sort
through our awareness

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
would allow us to get
through these blocks.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
They would allow us to
make better decisions

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and, in the process, develop
a better way of living.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:17.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have shown you how
to break your current reality

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
using movement and also
how to create an awareness

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:90%
through feedback, what's next?

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
How about imagination
and dimensions.

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:10%
To understand this, we
must understand that we

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:39.780 align:middle line:10%
are multi-dimensional beings.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, as we

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
explore transdimensional
interactions

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and what that means for
you and your reality.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:25:01.782 align:middle line:90%
