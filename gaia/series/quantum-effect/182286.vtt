>> There is a question that
everybody needs to answer

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.830 align:middle line:84%
at some point in
his or her life.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to be a
healthy human being?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.642 align:middle line:10%
There are now billions of
answers on the internet.

00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:31.100 align:middle line:10%
I think there should
be a sign that

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:10%
reads like a famous
fast food chain,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And what are the current
mainstream establishment

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:90%
selling?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
They are selling you
only a surface knowledge.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:84%
To really understand
our human health,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:90%
we need to understand energy.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
All efforts in human
health, well-being,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
unconsciousness have
energy at their base.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Energy transfer and
various forms and practices

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
around the world is now
referred to as energy medicine.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
My name is Randy Veitenherimer.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:10%
I have devoted about 40
years in the study and skills

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:10%
of energy medicine.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with over 25,000
clients all over the world.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, my
methods of energy medicine

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:90%
are different than most.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I have had teachers
such as physicists,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
kung fu masters,
Qigong instructors,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as shamans
and medicine men.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:84%
To be truly healthy, we
should be healthy physically,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
mentally, emotionally,
spiritually, psychically,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately, energetically.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do that?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's important to share
with people what the energy

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
crisis is in the human
body, and how important it

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
is for changing your perspective
on yourself and the world.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.775 align:middle line:90%
Let's go deeper.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:10%
Life is defined by
saying you have energy,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:10%
or you do not have energy.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And energy is taken away
from you from your thoughts

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and your feelings,
your connection

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to others, your environment,
and pretty much everything.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So the crisis occurs
in slow motion

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
your life because you

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
are unaware of your inability
to hold an energetic charge

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
or maintain the flow of the
life force through your body.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the life
force escapes from your body.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea would be to
establish how much you have.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
An ideal energy state would be
a human that is two years old.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.750 align:middle line:90%
They have a lot of energy.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
The calibration is based on
how much energy I've lost

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:90%
from the age of two years old.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is done through
kinesiological testing.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when they calibrate it,
they call it muscle testing.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Some kung fu masters
and masters of energy

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
use the energy field itself.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they can test
how much energy

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
you have based on what is
present in that person's energy

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a patient
has 31% percent

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:90%
of their optimal energy.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:90%
This patient is around late 30s.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
How did they get this way?

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.798 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out what
takes 69% of their energy.

00:03:47.798 --> 00:03:50.228 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So a kinesiologist
or energy master

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:90%
might break it down like this.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
About 20% of the loss is based
on close family relationships

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:90%
that are draining you.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Think about your relationships
with your mom, your dad,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:90%
your brother, your sister.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
These are first
level relationships

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
as far as energy
flow is concerned.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It represents a
DNA connection that

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
facilitates energy flowing from
you to your parents and vice

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The next level would be
say, sexual relationships

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
because of the
extent of the energy

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that flows during
these activities.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
When we have a
sexual relationship,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
we open up a channel
similar to the one

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
of a connection with
our parents in that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
there's an open and
free flow of energy

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
back and forth, even
with a past partner

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
unless you have taken measures
to try to either break or block

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:90%
those relationships.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Most people try to block them.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:90%
That drains energy also.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So we really don't
want to block them

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
so much as we want to
change the energy that flows

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:90%
from us to them and them to us.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
break up with a person

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean there's still not
an information and energy flow.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can experience that
throughout our entire life.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.055 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
If we move on, about
18% in this example

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is from a declining
health state,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
entropy that is draining
the body of energy

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's become
less efficient.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So the 31% optimal energy left
leaves this patient at 28 volts

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:90%
to start their day.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
According to some
Chinese practices,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to have
about 36 volts of energy

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:90%
when you wake up.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, you would recharge
your battery during the night

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and wake up with this
amount of voltage.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And through the
process of that day,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
you would lose energy until
you went to bed that night,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
when you would
recharge your voltage.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
With this patient's
example, this person

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
started the day
at 28 volts, which

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:90%
is on the level of depression.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they get
halfway through the day,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
it has gone down significantly.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is the
entire functions of the body

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
are being short changed
because of the lack of energy.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
You can have zero energy
but still function,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
just not as efficiently
or significantly

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
as if you are fully charged.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
But if some of these areas are
reset to optimize energy flow,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
then the others that are
negatives that drain you

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
would decrease.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, the
18% health decline

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
would be improved
by an energy master

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.241 align:middle line:90%
or certain energetic practices.

00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.626 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Before I explain how to
create more optimal energy,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
let's get into what
is the difference

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
between bioelectrical
and electrical energy.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Electricity flows through
our machines and is manmade.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But what flows through
animals, plants, and humans

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is organically produced and
has a different signature.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
This signature is the life
force that tops quantum physics.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Plugging you into a
light socket doesn't

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
work because you can't consume
that form of electrical energy.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the body itself though,
we acquire and consume energy

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:90%
through our energy field.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
The energy field consumes energy
off of other energy fields

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:90%
into center active.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
If you think about this,
being around people

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that are negative, and
you consume their energy,

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
you have basically influenced
your own energy state.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
And if you're around positive
people, the same thing occurs.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And this brings up a
good point, that you

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
don't have relationships
with people,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:90%
you have an energy exchange.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And the level of consciousness
in the energy exchange

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
determines whether you
consume energy or produce it,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
whether you take or
whether you give.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Each human has a resonant
energy exchange with the Earth.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
This is called a Von
Schumann resonance.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The Schumann
resonances are a set

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of spectrum peaks in they
extremely low frequency portion

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's electromagnetic
field spectrum.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Schumann are or global
electromagnetic resonances.

These are generated by
lightning discharges

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%

phenomena.

Humans have a global
electromagnetic resonance also,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's called the
collective consciousness.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So you are in a frequency
you resonate exchange.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
You exchange energy with
the chair you're sitting on,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
with the room you're
in, with the office you

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
work at, and basically
people, places, and things.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
You exchange energy
freely until you

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
come to the table with filters.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Filters say something
like, I am married.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:90%
I have a certain job.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I am, I am, I am.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Sp when these
filters are put up,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.150 align:middle line:84%
you modulate your energy
to or from other people,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:90%
other places, other things.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
what their filters are.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And this affects their
ability to perceive, receive,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.720 align:middle line:90%
and generate energy.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to
our original patient,

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
because of her life
experiences, the person

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.020 align:middle line:84%
has created blocks
and an obstacle

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to optimum health and
well-being because they do not

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
have knowledge of
how this works inside

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and outside of their body.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
call the energy crisis.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The crisis is the outcome of
not knowing the flows of energy

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
through life.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The lack of knowledge creates
depression, sickness, aging.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So how do we become
more knowledgeable

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:90%
of our own filters?

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
First, I tell people that there
are certain activities that

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:84%
have a higher energetic
component than just exercise.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
These could be things like
yoga, qigong, tai chi,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:90%
to just name a few.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:84%
These activities
are able to help

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
you get less involved
in depression,

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety, or other low level
of consciousness activities.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:90%

Life force is a subtle energy.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We are not aware of our
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
energy flows
throughout our body.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they control our
breathing, heart rate,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:84%
digestion, and a whole myriad
of other activities in the body.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:84%
That energy flow is, in
some ways, the same thing

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
as our thoughts or
feelings, things

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that go on in our
imagination, our dream states.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:10%
These are a form of
subtle body energies

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:10%
in that they are not
readily perceptive

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:10%
by the human consciousness.

Planck scale is a
measurement of size.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Planck scale is the magnitudes
of space, time, energy,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and other units
beyond or below which

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
the predictions of the standard
model of physics, quantum field

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
theory, and general relativity
are no longer reconcilable.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:84%
At the Planck scale,
current models

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
are not expected to be a
useful guide to the cosmos.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And physicists no longer have
any scientific model whatsoever

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:84%
to suggest how the
physical universe behaves.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So the field of physics
itself does a lot

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:84%
to explain physical reality
down to the smallest part.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
explain life itself.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So if we go to quantum
physics and the 0

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to minus 36 Planck
scale, at minus 36

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:84%
would go out of being
able to measure things.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is that
there is so much science can't

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:84%
explain, especially life
force itself, its origins,

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
its consumption, aspects
of its existence.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But if we add these experience
or layers of information

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and what consciousness
itself experiences,

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
we could explain
everything that is

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
happening to you inside and out
on all layers of consciousness.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So right now, the normal optimal
voltage is 36 volts, let's say.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to
the Planck scale,

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and also correlates
to the idea of adding

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
more levels to explore
yourself and express yourself.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We might even refer to these
as spiritual in nature.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I am telling you is
that you are experiencing things

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that aren't really defined in
science, but that doesn't mean

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:90%
it's not happening.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And with a knowledge of
awareness and understanding,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
you can create more
energy in your life.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:90%

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So 36 volts is just a metric.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
We could use any number
just as a starting point.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is it gives us a
reference point to start with.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we could
expand to maybe 40 volts.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
We could increase our capacity
to either produce or to hold

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
onto energy in the
form of voltage

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that would be available
for the operation of not

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.100 align:middle line:84%
just our physical body,
but actually our energy

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%
field and our consciousness.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.700 align:middle line:84%
When I was first
learning this, we

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.240 align:middle line:84%
were taught to expand up
to 40 volts of energy flow.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we were taught
to use 100 volts.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And since this was
martial arts, we

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
increased it to expand to
have 1,000 volts of energy.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
These very high energy
states most people

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:84%
don't experience except in
very extreme circumstances.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we were taught
and trained to be

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
able to produce and express
this much energy in our lives.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:22.479 align:middle line:90%

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So what was all this training to
produce 1,000 volts of energy?

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:90%
We used it in martial arts.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a life experience
that requires a lot of energy,

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
such as a fight, you would
need as much as you can get.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:10%
The same thing applies
if you have an illness,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:10%
or you have circumstances
where energy alone

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:10%
is what is required
in order for you

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:10%
to get over, or recover,
or become healthy again.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:10%
The training for this
was through kung fu,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:10%
through Kundalini yoga, and
through some other practices.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%

some of these practices.

Today, tai chi would
probably be the easiest way

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to start experiencing what
it means to flow energy

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:90%
That is an active way.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:90%
A passive way would be yoga.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.590 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at
those practices,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:10%
we are doing things
to increase the energy

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:10%
content of the human body.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.410 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
As energy flows up
and down your spine,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
it creates an
electromagnetic field.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
The bigger the
electromagnetic field,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
the more healthy you are.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
If you have a large
electromagnetic field that

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:84%
extends out to, say, a
minimum of nine feet,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:84%
then the ability to
be sick becomes less.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
It may not disappear,
but the probability

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is you will have more resistance
to illness and problems

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:90%
with your physical body.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.602 align:middle line:90%

The concept of a
big energy body also

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:90%
explains some other things.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody talks
about consciousness.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you need to raise
your consciousness.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
If your energetic
state increases,

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:90%
consciousness increases also.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So when people talk about
raising your consciousness

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and ascension, all
these come about

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:90%
with a bigger energy body.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
You do these practices,
and without much attention

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
on your part, you
develop an energy body.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And you develop an
energy body that

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
has a greater density, and
therefore a greater capacity

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.925 align:middle line:90%
to hold a charge.

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So these are some
of the things I

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
teach where holding that charge
in the face of negativity

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
in the face of disease
or illness around you

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
allows you to be
much more healthy,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and definitely much more
successful, because you

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
have the energy to execute
whatever it is that comes up.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality
itself, when we look

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
at the advancement
of our consciousness,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
two areas of love
and beyond where

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:84%
we go into some state
of transcendence

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
requires a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:10%
If every day, you are
expending all this energy

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:10%
in your relationships, in your
experiences with your body,

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:10%
in your environments, and
a million other things,

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:10%
these are all things that act
to drain your body of energy.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, having
a bigger energy body

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
itself would be an
ideal thing to do

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
to allow you to go through
life in a more benign manner

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.525 align:middle line:84%
with less disruption, less
disease, and less problems.

00:20:43.525 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:90%
So you can practice these.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:90%
They're not hard.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:90%
They're easy ways to start.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It requires you to just go
find out the information.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And remember, there's
millions and billions

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:90%
of things on the internet.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And it is your job to try to
explore those and find out

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:90%
what works for you.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't like telling
people specific practices,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
because everybody is special.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And what works for you may
not work for somebody else.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is up to you to find
those which work for you.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.505 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So all this talk about
energy, you can't see it.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But in the past,
apparently it was

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
something that was
notable and showed up

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
in the paintings
of the Renaissance

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:90%
when you see a halo.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:84%
When you see a halo
depicted around a person,

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
you are seeing a representation
of their energy field.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The first layer of that
energy feel is your etheric.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Your etheric feel is your field
of energy closest to your body.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn a
practice of being

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.940 align:middle line:84%
able to see energy
fields, you will actually

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
start seeing the
etheric field that

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:84%
surrounds a person, or
a place, or an object.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
exists emits photons.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see that
halo, when you see that energy

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.020 align:middle line:84%
field around a baby, you are
seeing a photonic emission

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
from our cells.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:90%
All our cells emit photons.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They emit more photons
when you have more energy.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So you become very
bright, or you look light,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or we use light as an
expression of somebody who

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
has a elevated consciousness.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in all
these, we're talking

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.330 align:middle line:84%
about the photonic
interactions that

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
occur with not only our cells,
but atoms and everything

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
else that exists.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So photonic relationships,
photonic emissions

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
really is our experience
of reality to some degree.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It is modulated by
your consciousness.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
36 volts as something

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that is like a reference
point, a metric to use,

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
talking about neutral.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning below 36 volts, I am
starting to emit less photons.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to
restrict or hold back

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
the amount of energy flowing
to functions and processes

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
If you restrict
the flow of energy

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to different parts of your body,
they function less efficiently.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If you increase, something
very interesting happens.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Depression and anxiety
are an increase

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of energy flow to those
portions of the brain that

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
produce the neural chemistry,
the outcome of which we

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:90%
call depression or anxiety.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Shutting down those
energy flows immediately

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:90%
stops the anxiety or depression.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I have seen this and done this
with thousands of patients.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So to be neutral is to not
be depressed or anxious.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And it is also to have
a normal flow of energy

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Anything less than neutral
becomes positive or negative.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
As you increase
your energy, this

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
will open you up to new
experiences with your body

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and life.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
Randy Veitenheimer.

Stay tuned for the next
episode as we dive deeper

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.680 align:middle line:90%
into the meaning of you.
