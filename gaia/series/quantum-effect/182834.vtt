00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:25.212 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDY VEITENHEIMER:
People always

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about ascension.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
But why ascension?

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Ascension is transitioning
from existing reality

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
into an imaginative existence.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
This has no reality, because
it only exists in zero reality,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:84%
nonconscious reality, the
reality of the imagination,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:90%
the reality of thinking.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:90%
It's only true over there.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not true in number one
reality, our physical reality.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
I like to transition that
conversation to transcendence,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
because that means
that the human being is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:10%
moving beyond the current
paradigm in physical reality

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.694 align:middle line:10%
and engaging in all
reality in one lifetime.

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:10%
What does it mean
to transcend and why

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:10%
is this important for humans?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it appears to
be a natural progression

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness and
it represents true evolution,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
not in form, but in
consciousness itself

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and the requirements of
an experiential existence.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
This also has, to
some degree, an effect

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:90%
on the human physical form.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The effect on the physical
form is illumination.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
We have talked about the human
energy field, the human energy

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
body, the human energy form
that supports our physical form.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And we see representations
of it throughout history.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of art tried to
depict the different states

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be human.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
elevated states, those

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that are illuminated, those
that have transcended,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
those that have
reached ascension,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
it is always accompanied
by a halo, sometimes

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
around the entire body,
but mostly around the head.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And we say those people are
illuminated from within.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:90%
What's this mean?

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It means that the total amount
of energy and consciousness

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
flowing through that person has
created an excess of photons

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and that those photons have
become so dense that they

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
literally become visible.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a baby, this is
just the etheric field.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
We can see this little energy
field that surrounds a baby.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
As we get older,
we tend to lose it.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But in some people,
and particularly those

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that have some type of
spiritual practices,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
we can see where that
photonic generation actually

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:84%
comes into existence,
in excess of what

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:90%
is normal for a human being.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
We call these
people enlightened.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The term itself, light, refers
to photons being generated.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:90%
We are a photonic entity.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:90%
It's how we see things.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's how we interact with
the primary sense of sight.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Sight allows us the
greatest information flow,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's when somebody
becomes spiritually inclined

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who has achieved
some state of existence

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that we start generating
this excess of photons.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they become
visible, that's

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
where we first start seeing
all these beautiful halos.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means
to be illuminated.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Transcendence itself is
generally available to anyone

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, through
various practices

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
of intention,
acceptance, forgiveness,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
among other things.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Human experiential existence
allows for and ultimately ends

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:90%
in the love for life itself.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:84%
This is transcendence and its
place in human consciousness'

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
evolution.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This is why we should focus on
transcendence versus ascension,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
because transcendence
is a reality.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And ascension is an
imaginative state

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of being with no physical
perceptive senses or biology.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Number one reality is physical.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And zero reality is
the nonphysical aspects

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:10%
And we use both of these
to expand ourselves

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:10%
and our consciousness.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Transcendence is to
go beyond duality

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:84%
into the unity of
the universe, which

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
means that you would unite
number one and zero reality.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
We are teaching duality, only
so people can understand it

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and then transcend
it to one reality.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:84%
When you are in unity
with the universe,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
you can see all
at the same time.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You can see the energetic
and the physical

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
when you exist as a
human on this planet.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
All the processes of
human life come together

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
as a functioning form of
transcendence as its outcome.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So how do we transcend?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we need the
courage to be ourselves.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
In this series, I've
given you many tools

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
to try and understand
one's self and also

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:90%
get in touch with one's self.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand you, you
need the courage to be oneself.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
You need to be unique,
you and the universe.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the first step
towards illumination.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.580 align:middle line:10%
Once you have made
this step, you

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:10%
have created movement
towards understanding

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:10%
the complexity of
the world around you

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:10%
and everything you
have experienced.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:10%


00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:10%
This understanding and
state of consciousness

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:10%
leads to compassion,
forgiveness, and gratitude

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:10%
for all life and all
life experiences.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We have reverence
to all existence.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the ability to observe
ourselves in a neutral state.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
It transcends our
history and our fears.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Emerging into this state is
to become fearless, accepting,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.957 align:middle line:84%
and appreciative of your life
and all life in the universe.

00:08:51.957 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's revisit the tools we
have learned in this series.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Tool number one, awareness.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Be aware beyond ourselves,
our local existence,

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
beyond your physical
number one reality.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
From awareness we
go into balance.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Balance is defined
as equipose, to not

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
favor one or the other
forms of reality.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Balance can be achieved
through neutrality.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Neutrality can be achieved
through nonjudgment

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and just observation.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:10%
Early in this series, I
gave you some exercises

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:10%
to simply reflect on your
day without judgment.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.310 align:middle line:10%
These exercises
strengthen neutrality.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:10%
When you are in neutrality, it
is making a choice for balance.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:90%
From balance, we go to moment.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The moment is the uniqueness
of our presence from moment

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:90%
to moment existence.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This is done through
contemplation and meditation.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:10%
From moment, we go to movement.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:10%
Movement comes from
each preceding moment.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
It emerges from this time
space into our space time.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
movement, now you

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to experience
yourself and life differently.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This could be considered the
pathway to transcendence.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Movement is either towards or
away, either with or against.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.770 align:middle line:10%
When you come out of the moment
you start energizing movement

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:10%
and you now have momentum and
energy to move forward in life.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, we come to the application
of the will to change momentum.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the exercising
of free will.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So you eventually
experience life

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:84%
as movement towards
transcendence

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and a letting go of
duality to reach a state

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%
of unity and illumination.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And now, you are including the
unity of the entire universe

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
in your life and
in your existence.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:90%
What is illumination?

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It is the fulfillment of
the physical and energetic

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
in human form.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
The illumination is
harder for humans,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
because all thinking is a
lie and all thinking has

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.460 align:middle line:84%
pre-existence state
in the universe

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and then comes into
reality based on the fact

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have and think
that we are those thoughts.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts are part of the
collective consciousness.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And individual reception
of those thoughts

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that are picked up by your
mind and then made into reality

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily true.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
From pure
consciousness, you can.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And a pure consciousness
you will return.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
You will do this,
whether you pursue

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
any form of advancement of
consciousness in this lifetime.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
You will keep coming
back according

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to Vedic literature,
gnostic, and other alchemical

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual theories.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You will continue
your advancement only

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:90%
as your consciousness elevates.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about transcendence

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:84%
is it occurs not only
on an individual level.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:90%
It can occur in a family group.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It can occur as a social group.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It can occur as the
consciousness of a nation.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It can occur as the
consciousness of the world.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Every step in
transcendence has an effect

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
on the evolution of not just
yourself, but of all humanity.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The elevation of consciousness
has an effect on everybody

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and on everything around you.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
At lower levels
of consciousness,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
such as guilt, evil, shame,
you are infecting everything

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and everyone around you.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.625 align:middle line:90%
You are infecting reality.

00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
At the middle levels
of consciousness,

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:90%
you are affecting humanity.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And the higher levels
of consciousness, you

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:84%
are inspiring and
elevating humanity.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:05.810 align:middle line:10%
When a person emerges into
a state of transcendence

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:10%
from a horrible situation,
from an addiction,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:10%
from destructiveness to human
nature or their surroundings,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.220 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes we find in family
units or in societies,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:10%
that the entire
group transcends.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The entire group moves
with that one person

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.455 align:middle line:84%
that was able to transcend
their current paradigm.

00:15:32.455 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
What percentage
of humanity needs

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to transcend to change all
of our current reality?

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Right now, with the
current earth population,

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
we would need about
16 million people

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the current level
of consciousness on this planet

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:90%
and elevate it.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
At the level of
courage and neutrality,

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
you're actually providing
the space and opportunity

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to expand consciousness.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we keep going
in a transcendent that state,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you start providing inspiration
to everyone that is around you.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.673 align:middle line:90%
I like Vedic literature.

00:16:40.673 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:84%
They are some of the oldest
surviving texts in the world.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
All of the early texts in
history describe a journey.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They all tell the
story of coming

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:84%
into being, going
through hardship,

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and eventually transcending
and leaving this world behind.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the story
of transcendence.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
It is something that we
don't teach so much anymore.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
It is the story of
elevation of consciousness.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It is the story of the
journey of the soul.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And in current literature we
call it the hero's journey.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Every human being is a hero.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:90%
They go through being born.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And they go through all the
experiences of their life

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and eventually transcend
to finding peace and joy

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.680 align:middle line:90%
in the nonphysical world.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Transcending the world has
been explained not just

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:90%
by the Vedic.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The gnostic texts were much
more simplified and gave steps.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:90%
They gave training.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
They gave teachings to
go from here to there.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:10%
The concept of love,
the concept of balance,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:10%
the concept of the golden
rule exist in all these texts.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The gnostic texts
were the first that

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:56.850 align:middle line:84%
started explaining it in a
way that could be repeated,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
allegorical references,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.130 align:middle line:84%
where you had to
figure it out yourself.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Alchemical texts were different.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:90%
They put a secrecy over it.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
All alchemical studies
were considered secret.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
They were not to
be talked about.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
You weren't supposed to
particularly share information.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:10%
You were supposed to journey
down that road on your own

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully come to some point
in the universe where you had

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:10%
transcended, not only all
physical matter, but also

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.020 align:middle line:10%
all spiritual being.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
You would literally
go out of existence.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:90%
You would no longer reincarnate.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
You won't have to come
back to this planet

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and yet this planet,
in its existence,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
is one of the sole
places in the universe

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to have experiential existence
as the basis for life itself.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
In this series, I've
talked about the duality

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of reality, light and dark,
positive and negative,

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:90%
good and bad.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Yin Yang symbol is
a very interesting thing,

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.665 align:middle line:90%
because it depicts reality.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the
light and the dark.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
In every light
there is darkness.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
In every darkness
there is light.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:07.460 align:middle line:84%
The duality of reality is that
there's no duality number one.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But as a human
being, you can only

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:90%
engage one side or the other.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the good and the bad,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at a duality.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
light and darkness,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at duality.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.290 align:middle line:90%
But they're both equal.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:90%
One's not bad.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you first
start out in life,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
you start in a judgmental
position that one is good

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and one is bad.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We can go out of
all of that judgment

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and encompass life itself.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
No person, no thing, no
part of this universe

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:90%
is bad in and of itself.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
It requires you to
make the judgment

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:90%
that something is good or bad.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
As you age, with no
training, no dedication,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.200 align:middle line:84%
no spiritual
practices, you still

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:90%
come to a point of acceptance.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
You still emerge into a
balanced state of nonjudgment.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Think of this process
involving your thoughts,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
involving your religion,
involving your politics,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
involving your
social connections,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and your social consciousness.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And in all of it,
judgment comes into play.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you go beyond it, you
find that you're more relaxed.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
You find that
you're more neutral.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You find you have more
energy for your own life.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
have more energy

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
for the things that
are important to you.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself less
destructive of this planet

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:90%
and yourself.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
These are all
admirable traits that

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
can be achieved through
your own consciousness,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:90%
through your own contemplation.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They do not require
you to have a teacher.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They do not require you to seek
out some spiritual advancement.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
They only require
you to pay attention

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to actually begin
to have awareness

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of life in the universe from
your perspective of being you.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
My work for the
last 50 years has

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:84%
been to understand transcendence
through all different areas

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
of research, which included
martial arts, Chinese medicine,

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Native American practices,
as well as quantum physics.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized,
and hope you realize,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
is that we are all
capable of contributing

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves and the greater
existence of the human race.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We do this by coming
from the negative

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
to the neutral to the
positive in life experiences.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Learning to love all that
exist in each moment,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
this is our life purpose
and our journey together.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:16.587 align:middle line:90%
