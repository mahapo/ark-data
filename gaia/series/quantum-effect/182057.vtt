All these people have
tried to explain it.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like
explaining a color.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to do.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Once you move into
that energetic ocean

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and have actually
experienced it,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
it is the same thing as trying
to describe a color as a sound

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
or a sound as a color.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:90%

You are a part of it.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:84%

you to be able to see it.

One of the things
that happens is that

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:90%
in deep meditative states--

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
they also are called
death states--

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that your awareness
can finally expand out

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:90%
beyond the human physical form.

We are given this
human physical form

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
to interact with this
universe, to this reality.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
But there is a far
bigger one, and people

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:90%
want to know about it.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So one of the traps of higher
consciousness and evolution

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
transform yourself

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is that, at some point,
you lose the desire

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
to be interactive in life.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

People have isolated themselves.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
When you do this, it's
like an isolation tank.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Your awareness expands out.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And it can expand out
in a positive direction

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to include the whole
universe, or it

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
can go in a negative direction
and show up all your fears.

to freeze and to become static.

ourselves and to find some
evolution of our consciousness

a physical being.

quantum physics tries to do.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:84%
is infinite in itself
and its expression.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
We differentiate energy into
various forms and functions

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:90%
according to its outcomes.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
All existence and
experiences are an outcome

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
of various forms of energy.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
these components,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and what are their percentages
as they apply to human life?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Human energy is one component,
plant energy, animal energy,

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
earth energy, psychic
energy, cosmic energy.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things is
that none of these things

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:90%
exist in the energetic ocean.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
The energetic ocean is pure
imagination at one level.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It's pure formlessness
if we go to the Dao.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's only as it
comes into expression

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:84%
or only comes into observation
that we start giving it names.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
If we take human energy, plant
energy, animal energy, earth

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
energy, psychic energy, cosmic
energy, and every other one

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.800 align:middle line:84%
we can put a name
to, we probably

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:90%
have come up with less than 1%.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's such an
infinite small percentage

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:84%
of the entire energetic
ocean, it still gives us

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
the ability to operate.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The 99% is still
there to be explored.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Its existence is
continuous and extant.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
faculties of consciousness

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that we can explore the unknown,
that we can incorporate that

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't exist into
our own ability to be alive

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to
evolve ourselves.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the
origin of curiosity

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in humans, the sheer
knowingness when

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
you come into existence that
there is something greater

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
out there and our innate desire
to find it or to look at it

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:90%
or to explore it.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:84%
This allows you, the viewer,
to tap into the 99% unknown

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and to create and participate
in a new, evolving universe

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
for you and the
collective consciousness.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.670 align:middle line:90%

[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics
terms, we become

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:84%
aware of our entanglement
with all life,

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of your energy
flow and your connection.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:90%
We're connected to somebody.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
We're entangled with
them in quantum physics.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We also recognize we're
in a coupled state.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
This means that there is a
greater level of information

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:90%
transfer going on.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a greater connection.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:90%
There is an expanded bandwidth.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
This is what it means to be
in a coupled state to me.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we
accept our ground

meaning the entire universe

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
is me, and I am the
entire universe,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also a
fulfillment of life in all

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:90%
its aspects and pervasiveness.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So how can you use the energetic
ocean to your advantage?

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
The more you are aware of
these forms of energy, the more

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
understanding and
potential for interaction

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and gaining knowledge from them.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The creator has given us all
of the Earth and the universes

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:90%
to understand ourselves.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
By studying plants and
animals, our cousins,

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:84%
we become more integrated
with life, our environment,

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:90%
and our existence.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The energetic ocean we exist in
is also an information ocean.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And it is infinite in nature.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But we have the tools of
curiosity and consciousness

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to explore it,
to be able to encompass

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
a new point of view,
and thereby bring

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:84%
new knowledge and a new form
of consciousness and existence

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.345 align:middle line:90%
into the entire cosmos.

00:24:08.345 --> 00:24:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:84%
You can come to a
place of comfort

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and a benign relationship to
the universe and to yourself.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

Up next, I would like to share
with you one of the biggest

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:84%
transformations
we are faced with,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:90%
which can be described as death.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Death to everyone
seems so final.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But I will explain how it is a
part of transformation process

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
that continues existence.
