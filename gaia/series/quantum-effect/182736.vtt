The dictionary says that
this is the action or process

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:90%
And where did you come from?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:10%
These are two questions
each human on this planet

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
asks themselves at some point.

fill in the blanks for you.

is, in the first place.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
defining existence.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Human existence-- to me-- is
the presence of consciousness

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:90%
in a physical form.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:10%
It is the summation of vectors
of information, energy,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Where do you come from?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
We think that the
human being begins

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
with a combination of the egg
and sperm, producing a zygote.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that you have a
pre-existing personality that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is downloaded, and
becomes expressable

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:90%
in the human physical form.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
The physical form itself
comes into existence

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
from a predefined field
that we call human.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This field has to exist
before it can be fulfilled.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:84%
The information is transmitted
through the combined

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
physicality of
the egg and sperm,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and expands into the human
mold or a mold of humanness.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
That spacial field
is also pre-existing.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We have a pre-existing
consciousness-- you.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And a pre-existing
form, which is human.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And a pre-existing field that
is humanness and humanity.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a pre-existing
consciousness in the field,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and it is manifesting
itself into the field form.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:84%
This then, is when you come in
to the pre-existing human field

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and form that is based on
the collective consciousness

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of humanity from
which it originates.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
This means all humans
look like humans.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And also your human
form is defined

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
by the genetic
makeup of the zygote

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:90%
as a physical human blueprint.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
This blueprint has
information and parameters

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that limit the expression
of the human form

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
into defined characteristics.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The pre-existing
consciousness can only

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:90%
come into a pre-existing form.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:90%
This form is human.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So who or what created the
pre-existing consciousness?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is this morphic state
or form called the human form?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And who created that?

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We can tie these
things together--

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
pre-creation consciousness,
procreation physicality

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that combine into a
post-creation completion.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say,
there is a pre-existing form

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:90%
for a snow leopard.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The extent of the morphic
field and the quantity

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:90%
of the creative energy--

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
life force-- creates the
spatial availability.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And limits the number
of snow leopards

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that can be born
onto the planet.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
This is true for all
species and forms of life.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
If the energized
population field shrinks,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the snow leopard
population would shrink.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The point is the morphic
field identity shrinks.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
This explains the
emergence of various life

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:90%
forms and their extinction.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
This also defines
the human form.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The morphic field
defines how many

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:90%
humans can be on this planet.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.260 align:middle line:10%
And how many other lifeforms
it can make room for.

Let's get back to
pre-existing consciousness.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It is a locus in time-space.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
This is different from our
reality of space and time.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:24.045 align:middle line:84%
Space-time is our reality, and
time-space is all of reality.

00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
This means it's a reciprocal
to our space-time continuum.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is we
only have the reference

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:90%
of space-time continuum.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
To explore time-space
as a source of existence

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
is to explore zero
reality, where time, space,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and reality are mutable.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.085 align:middle line:90%

There hasn't been anyone to
define this area of time-space,

except in mystical
terms and references.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I think these could be
re-referenced and add

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:90%
to our understanding of life.

Time-space has
different properties.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:90%
It has different information.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It can be studied.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:90%
It can be gridded.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Because we know throughout
history that some people have

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:10%
acquired the same information
at different times and places

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

Even Einstein, and
Tesla, and others

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
said that the information
was available to them.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:84%
That they were able
to go there and get

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.318 align:middle line:90%
that particular information.

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we look around
and find that others were

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:90%
able to go to the same place.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The explanation being that this
information, just like you,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
pre-exists in some
energetic state.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
That energetic state is
something that can be found.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.455 align:middle line:90%

into our space and time.

Consciousness without form is
called non-local consciousness.

We don't deal with non-local
consciousness in this reality.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
This helps you understand,
you can condition the field

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to some degree to create
existence or opportunity.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The same concept works
for all things in life--

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:90%
ideas, a partner, a job.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:10%
For example-- when
a group of people

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.600 align:middle line:10%
do a brainstorming
session, they are

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:10%
creating an act of procreation
using the idea of post-creation

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:10%
as something decidable.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
What you or a group
wants or desires

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
becomes a source of creation
through communication

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of this desire and
intercourse with space-time

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
to bring into existence
post-creation.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:51.298 align:middle line:90%

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
If all of life is a circle, this
might be what it looks like.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I am taking a
post-creation idea,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going into
procreation, which

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:90%
is intercourse with space-time.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And then by extension
of my thoughts and mind,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to go into time-space and
make it into a reality

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that can, in turn,
reverse, and come

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.440 align:middle line:90%
into our space-time reality.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This means that
when you are trying

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to create a future
situation, you would

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:90%
choose what situation you want.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Then you would condition
your energetic field.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And through communication
and actions,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
when conditions in the
field are appropriate,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:90%
you would achieve that creation.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
And then here comes the kicker--

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
you cannot create
all of reality.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:90%
There has to be conditions.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Some sort of environment.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Some sort of content.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of connection
that would allow

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:90%
all this to come into being.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Or the quantum probability wave
that has that potential outcome

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
collapses into space-time,
which is your reality.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Quantum probability is
a time-space aspect.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Time-space is zero reality.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And it has its own rules that
are not necessarily scientific

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:84%
or follow scientific
laws or mechanics.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:84%
There are instances
where our consciousness

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:84%
can come into a form that
has not previously existed.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:84%
There are only a
few on the planet

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
that can create in time-space.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:90%
This is almost God-like powers.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
This is purely in a place
where you can create something

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.190 align:middle line:90%
that never existed before.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:10%
In the morphic field, you can
tap into pre-existing form

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:10%
from a pre-existing
consciousness.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Or these skills can be acquired
from the existing space.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But to create something
that never existed,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:84%
you have to be able
to tap into time-space

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
with extreme powers of awareness
and interactive skill sets.

In all of human history, there

to understand creation.

Most of the time, people

Or through lack of information,
they create a myth.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
societies, historically

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and currently, have
their myths of creation.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.876 align:middle line:84%

something like the Big Bang.

they refer to it

as form coming out
of the formless.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.930 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, they explain
it as the translation

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
from one existence to
another, from a state

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:19.180 align:middle line:84%
of non-physical being and
the state of physical being.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
This is that circle
of life that everyone

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
tries to explain with their
myth or their miracle.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
It's always a miracle
how life begins.

Not knowing what came
before the miracle

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
allows us to start
with a miracle.

that had some of
these capabilities.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
That enabled them to
encompass the infinite.

references is some beings

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
that were called the Bonpo.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%

are energetic beings

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%

At the same time,
there was another area

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
that also developed an
interest in this transmutation

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
process of going from the
physical to the non-physical,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:90%
and back to the physical.

In Egypt, it became the
basis for mummification.

The idea that the human
being can be resurrected,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and reacquire life force,
as the old human being

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.260 align:middle line:90%

This alchemical process
is a transmutation.

It was never about
changing lead into gold.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
It was transcending the human
being physical form and return

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:90%
to that state of existence--

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:90%
zero or non-physical reality.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.945 align:middle line:84%

universe, and not its duality.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:10%
I think what's interesting is
that throughout our history,

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:10%
there have been continual
efforts to delete or eliminate

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:10%
information and any kind of
training that would allow

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:10%
you to advance your conscious
interactions with the universe.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It seems like every
conquering culture

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.765 align:middle line:84%
wants to destroy
what has come before.

00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, eliminated
the advancement of anyone

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
who would choose to
pursue that knowledge.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So alchemy, Daoism-- starting
in the 1900s, late 1890s,

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
they became, very much,
something to be ignored

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:84%
or something to
not be considered.

And yet, you find that there's
all these layers of philosophy

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and techniques that would allow
a person to advance themselves

outside of the

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:84%

I have a martial
arts background.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The Bonpo were a
martial society.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.640 align:middle line:90%
They were warriors.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%

translate themselves

from one place to another.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%

form to energetic form,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and back to physical.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many of our Kung
Fu movies that refer to this,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
or allude to it, or actually
try to demonstrate it.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.425 align:middle line:84%

had an existence in reality.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that these people
represented the difference

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
between somebody who is
fixated in physical reality

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%

without physical reality.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Their ability to
go back and forth

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and transition
seamlessly is something

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:90%

Native American teachings

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
as being able to

into the universe with
our consciousness.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%

see, whatever we encounter,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever we experience,
and translate it back

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that I think would be a better
use of my physical form,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I could develop
additional skills.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I might grow additional
senses beyond the ones

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:90%
that we are born with.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
The Bonpo could
develop these senses.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
They could develop
these skill sets

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that gave them a more extensive
to interact with the universe.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
That's important
because the universe

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:84%
keeps getting richer
and richer the more you

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:90%
can expand into it.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:90%

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Now that I was able
to lay out creation

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
from all points
of reality, I hope

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
this helps you on your journey
to understanding where you

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:90%
came from, and why you're here.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the
current paradigm,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about the
meaning of transcendence.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:90%
