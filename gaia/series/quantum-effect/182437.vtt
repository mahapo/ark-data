>> Who are you?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I have come up with a one word
response to this question,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and the word is memory.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Your entire existence originates
from the memory delivered

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
in the form of DNA,
RNA, chromosomes,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of
physical memory transfer.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
In addition, you are the
ongoing transformation

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:90%
of energy as consciousness.

From studying human health
and energetic fields

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.460 align:middle line:10%
and practicing energetic

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:10%
of clients over
the past 40 years,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:10%
I have filled a
lot of notebooks.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for all
my meditation teachers,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
martial arts instructors,
Native American mentors,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and enlightened teachers
of consciousness.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
My intent in sharing
this information

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is that you will
be able to increase

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:90%
your own ability to be healthy.

The owner's manual for a
human being is inside you.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
This manual exists as
human consciousness.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The human consciousness
manual that exists inside you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
knows your history, your nature,
experiences, and potential.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive in.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:90%

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's explain the
universe inside you.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:10%
You have an internal landscape.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Peaks and valleys,
oceans, the mountains,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
things that are joyful, and
things that are not pleasant.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
This internal landscape is
where you actually live.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
People think they exist
in the external world.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:10%
But we really live in
our internal landscape,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:10%
one of our own making, and
one of our own accumulation.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So where we physically
live, grow up,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and work are our reference set.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the data field we occupy.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is all external
information.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And out of that we
develop a preference set.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:10%
And a preference set
is what we prefer

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:10%
to have in our reference set.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, what
color do you like?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Also as an example, we
can look at a video game.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
When you play a video game, you
set the landscape, the people

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you play with, and the
skill sets you want to use.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Life is no different.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.100 align:middle line:84%
These are all
preferences that you

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:90%
enjoy in a new external game.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.965 align:middle line:84%
And they apply to
life in reality.

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
The preference set in real
life becomes an operational set

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:90%
in your everyday life.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Operational sets can be viewed
as habits, training, routines.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
We haven't said these are
good or bad yet because they

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
can be either or both, depending
on the situations you're in.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Operational sets get a
bad or good reputation

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
because it is transactional
with the field of existence,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.154 align:middle line:84%
which includes the fields of
people, places, and things.

So let's say you like people
who drive motorcycles.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You like their attitude, their
style, and the adventure of it.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:10%
But you meet someone who
doesn't own a motorcycle,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:10%
and they don't like
your motorcycle.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you're picking
up that they don't like you

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
because your operational set
says you like people who drive

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:90%
motorcycles, and they don't.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
In this reality,
you would signal

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
what you like with wardrobe,
devices, tattoos, and things

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to let people know what
our preferences are.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
People like to play with people
with the same preferences

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.125 align:middle line:84%
because it validates their
existence in this reality.

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:90%

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So what we are using our
reference points to create

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
are preference points that
better serve who we really

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
are and thus create an
operational system that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is a source of joy
instead of pain.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This creates
operational success.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
We can arrive there through
meditation and contemplation,

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.385 align:middle line:84%
or we can be pushed
there through conflict.

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Normally humans are pushed by
conflict and not meditation

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
to examine their preferences
and operational systems.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:90%
But why is conflict important?

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Conflict allows contrast.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We can take any kind of
moment and examine, what

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.070 align:middle line:90%
was our point of participation?

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we do
that, we shouldn't

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
use judgment but
observation of what

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:84%
did you like about your
participation in it.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:84%
From this point, you can
come to your own preference

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
set without using your
previous reference set.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you're truly making
decisions based on who you are

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.569 align:middle line:84%
and using your abilities
consciously and accordingly.

life without judgment?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%

down and meditating

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:84%

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They are always moving on
to the next person or thing

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
instead of stopping
to focus on something.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:10%

on the internal landscape.

Nothing that you
can grasp externally

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
will really make your
preference set better.

of things I teach

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Awareness is the first
martial art I teach.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:10%
Balance is the
second one, where we

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:10%
balance our internal
and external landscapes.

learning when to do things.

Movement, learning
what to move and where

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:10%
to go with that movement.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:10%
And then once we start moving in
any particular direction, even

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:10%
self-improvement, we start
having some momentum.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:10%
Something that
carries us forward

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:10%
without too much more input.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth one is the
use of the will, which means

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.715 align:middle line:90%
you use your will to change.

00:08:46.715 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%

smoking or drinking or losing

weight.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:90%
That is the use of the will.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You are changing
your preference set

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and using your will to do it.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
All these are involved in coming
to a greater understanding

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.860 align:middle line:90%
of what it is to be ourselves.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:15.204 align:middle line:90%

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
You can see why now conflict
is a catalyst for change

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
because we ignore our
internal landscape until it

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:90%
can't be ignored.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And the conflict shows up
in our external reality.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Number one reality.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
you use your will

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:90%
to change your preference set?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
The conflict internally
and externally

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen because
you have matched who

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:90%
you are to your surroundings.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:10%
If we go back to what
drains our energy

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:10%
and our ability to
move forward in life,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:10%
it is internal conflict
between your reference

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:10%
set in your preference
set and your memory.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
You might say things like,
I like my job, but I prefer.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
This causes internal
conflict, and now we

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
have an energy drain Energy
drains like this one cause

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
aging, fatigue, disease,
and depression and anxiety

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
by the absence of
the energy you need

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to maintain your life in an
orderly and healthy fashion.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about your memory.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.800 align:middle line:84%
You come preloaded from
birth onto this planet

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
with a reference set that
are encoded in your DNA, RNA,

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and chromosomes.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So life becomes a
constant interplay

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
between what you were
given at pre-birth

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and then all your experiences
and all the preferences

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:90%
you have developed.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So now you need to decide,
what are my real preference

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.385 align:middle line:84%
sets based on my experiences
and not my genetic encoding?

00:11:33.385 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Life begins with a
set of templates.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Those templates carry
something like a trillion

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:90%
to the fourth power of memory.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
None of these are activated
until energy flows

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:90%
through them.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So your brain is not
capable of handling

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the total amount of memory
that exists in the universe.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
your energy field

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
itself acts as a
memory depository.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
All those sit there in
a form of data memory

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%
that's electromagnetic.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And we access it either
consciously or non-consciously.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And the greater part of it
is accessed non-consciously.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:90%
We try to bury our memories.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%
We try to deny access to them.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We hold them or block
them because the way

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the human being
experiences reality

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
is largely related to learning.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And learning is
based in negatives.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So that if you
hurt yourself, you

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
would store that memory so that
you wouldn't do that again.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Negative memories
serve a purpose.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose is for
the survival of the self

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and survival of the species.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:10%
Good memories do not
carry the same charge

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:10%
that negative memories do.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.340 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it takes about
25 positive experiences

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:10%
to overcome the energy
state of a negative memory.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is where epigenetic
change can come into play.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
You, as a mother, could
be scared to death

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
so many times that
you change your DNA

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and pass on those
fears to your child.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
These changes that
occurred in the mother

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:90%
were then passed onto the child.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The child never had
those experiences.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This goes also for
you as an individual.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Something might have happened
to you that changes your DNA

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and how you react to things
in your reference set.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
These are memories that have
altered your view of the world.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
You need to figure
out what is truly you

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and what has been
programmed inside of you.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:16.198 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.198 --> 00:14:19.635 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:19.635 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Self-contemplation
through meditation

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is the way to break
through these programs.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of
meditation practices

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
you can try, and it's important
to find one that works for you.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:90%
I teach something very simple.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I teach finding a quiet
spot in the evening.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Sit with your back
straight against the wall.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And against the wall
allows you to feel safe

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:90%
instead of on edge.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Then you close your eyes
and do a review of your day.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And do it without judgment,
and do it quickly.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
This takes practice.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
But once you have been able
to review your life daily

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
without judgment, you can
move on to the next step.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The next step is called
the path of negation.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The path of negation is
to say, I am not that.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm not tired,
I'm not angry, I'm not sad,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not unfulfilled.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I am
not all of these things

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
that drain energy out of me.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I am me.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And we repeat this process a
few times until the tension

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the body.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
This process helps focus on
what defines your universe

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
inside you.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest thing
to say in the world

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:90%
is that you are yourself.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
There are three
terms that we could

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
use to explain the
universe inside us

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and how that dictates the
universe on the outside

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:90%
that you interact with.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:10%
Those terms would be
translation, transformation,

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:10%
and transcendence.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
These are processes that
we go through every day.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:10%
Every interaction you have
with somebody is a translation.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Their actions, you translate.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And you translate these
through all the filters

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:90%
of your consciousness.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The filters of
your consciousness

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
can be as simple as somebody
wants to take me for ice cream.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Do I have permission?

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Do I deserve ice cream?

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I ate too
much food this week.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:90%
Is this good for me?

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Does this help me?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Does this move me forward?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Is this beneficial?

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And those are additional
filters that we

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.630 align:middle line:84%
use to translate all
the information that

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:90%
goes on around this.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:10%
All this adds up to
a tremendous amount

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:10%
of processing capacity
devoted to just trying

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.786 align:middle line:10%
to make sense out of reality.

If you have made it through
this translation program

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:10%
and something important
comes up as a result

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.360 align:middle line:10%
of that contemplation
of those actions,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:10%
you actually go into a
state of transformation.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You would be willing to
change your viewpoint.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we all know, there
are certain subjects--

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
politics, religion, love--
where this is very difficult.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty arises
either in the perception

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.430 align:middle line:90%
of our translation.

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Are we right?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Self-doubt is where
this comes from.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And so self-doubt itself becomes
a hindrance, or a handicap,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to going into transformation,
where we transform ourselves

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
from one state of
consciousness to another.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:10%
Or from one economic
level to another,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:10%
from one location to another,
because transformation

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:10%
occurs in our own
consciousness, in our own body,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:10%
in our own locations,
in our own reality.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
If you make it all the way
through transformation,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:90%
now you get into transcendence.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Transcendence is
specifically related

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to a contemplative or meditative
outcome, where the ideal is

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
to recognize reality and
recognize everything that goes

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
on in it to the
point that you escape

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
or transcend the actions,
the Karma, the outcomes,

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:90%
the consequences.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
This happens because you're able
to perceive the sequences that

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.350 align:middle line:90%
are involved.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you tend
to make better decisions.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this ends up in
being a better preference set.

So the advancement
of consciousness

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
becomes a source of a
better reference set

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to relate to reality and to
not be so engaged in that

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
which is negative and
become more engaged

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:90%
in that which is positive.

How do we get there?

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:42.125 align:middle line:90%
Being neutral.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.595 align:middle line:84%
Neutral is a very
interesting place.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It is probably the best
meditative technique.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:84%
People ask, what do you
think of this or how

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.400 align:middle line:90%
do you feel about this?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
would be, I don't.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
What that means is, I devote
no energy to that idea

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
or that thought.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
This can even extend into things
like heat and cold, the weather

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.510 align:middle line:84%
conditions, where
you find yourself.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you devote
energy in a negative way,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:90%
it drains you of energy.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And that energy is no longer
available for the functioning

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
of your body, let
alone your mind.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So to be neutral really
is kind of a first step.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:84%
If you can get
yourself to this point,

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
if you can go through your
day and look at the negatives

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and look at the positives and
at the end of it be neutral,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
that is what it
means to be relaxed.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Everybody tells you, be relaxed.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
How about, be neutral?

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Being neutral means you don't
have to make a decision,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.280 align:middle line:84%
a decision isn't
required of you,

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
a choice isn't required
of you, and you don't

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:90%
have to devote energy to it.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:84%
If you can practice
neutrality, you

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
have the option of moving
up in your consciousness.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
too attached to it.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
But as you go beyond these and
engage your internal landscape

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:29.350 align:middle line:84%
more, you come to value
the concept of yourself.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
you come to value

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.660 align:middle line:84%
the concept of
everybody and everything

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
else as something that
is neutral or beneficial

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.445 align:middle line:90%
or ultimately as great.

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.064 align:middle line:90%

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
All existence is
a wonderful thing.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Only in humans do we find
self-sacrifice as a way

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
to squander the life
force that we accumulate

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:90%
every day and every night.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So to retain that
life force means

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that you go into the
next day with a bigger

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
charge, with a bigger
capacity, with more energy.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, you actually
provide for your own,

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
not only relief, but you
provide for your own advancement

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and the ability
to engage reality

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
at a new level that
doesn't include

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:84%
the negative so much as a
requirement to go through life.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the news,
always the negative comes up.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Just your awareness of
this should alert you

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that the positive also exists
and that to be positive

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.530 align:middle line:90%
is a way to retain energy.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So as we come out from under
the negative emotional states,

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
we do that by being
able to be neutral.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we come
to the understanding

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be
able to transform ourselves

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:90%
inside ourselves.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.635 align:middle line:84%
And from that transformation
comes our transcendence

00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to one of the highest
states of consciousness

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:84%
we can experience and
still be in this universe

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:90%
and still be alive.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the universe inside us,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
how does movement
make you more aware?

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:90%
How does this affect your mind?
