>> I have a question for you.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
How much of your
current life takes place

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in an electronic
communication world?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And how does that calibrate in
zero and number one reality?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, we spend most
of our time connecting

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
using instant
communications, through text,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:90%
social media, et cetera.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
These are dimensional
interactions.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:84%
They all occur in
zero reality and not

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
in physical or
number one reality.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:10%
My name is Randy
Veitenheimer, and it's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:10%
important to have a clear
understanding of how

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:10%
digital communication
affects our 0-1 reality.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Armed with this knowledge,
we have the ability

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to use these interactions for
our own health and well-being.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
We also want to explore what
is beyond the digital realm

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions
that might be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
This episode is meant to give
us a better understanding of how

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
we energetically
participate and interact

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
with our new reality today and
other dimensions of existence.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.354 align:middle line:84%
Let's refresh on what
proximate reality is.

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:10%
For most people, reality
consists of duality.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
That duality is our
physical existence

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and our non-physical
reality, which

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:90%
is our experiential reality.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Physical interactions
have a feedback,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and that is considered
number one reality.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Experiential reality is
our thoughts, our feelings,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and any information that comes
through non-physical means.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:90%
This I consider as zero reality.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:84%
The majority of our time today
is spent in a physical world,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
but the majority of our
experiences of that world

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:90%
is in the non-physical universe.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
We can lump all physical
and non-physical events

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
into what we call our
human energy field.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And our energy field
contains the information.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So for most people, we
don't experience energy,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
we experience it as
information, and that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
is how we process energy.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
If we look at how we go
through the night and the day

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
of each human life, the night
is an experiential experience,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
where information is being
participated in and downloaded.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Since it is entirely
experiential and non-physical,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:84%
we don't retain the
information as easily

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
as we do through
physical interactions.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So how does
information come to you

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
if you're not consciously
reading the energy

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:90%
or information?

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
At night, you're
much more open to

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the non-physical
information, which

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is contained in other
dimensions of existence.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's real popular
in physics to talk

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
about this in the form
of parallel universes.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is
processing the energy

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
from these other dimensions
in the form of dreams

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:90%
or semiconscious participation.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:10%
There was a study
done at Harvard

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:10%
on sleep and sensory
inputs, and in this study

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:10%
they discovered when you sleep,
your senses become absent

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:10%
of the body.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:90%
They are in non-physical space.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Your senses travel to wherever
your dreams and subconscious

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:90%
activity is going on.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Visual experiences,
smells, feeling of falling,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
sounds you might hear, your
senses become non-local.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
This study proves
that zero reality

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
has an energetic
property that you

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
are interactive with whether
you're aware of it or not.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
This is also represented
in the physical

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:84%
or during the day, as that's
when most people are not

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
aware of the information
they are picking up.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.155 align:middle line:84%
In this sense, most
people's senses stay local.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
When you text and drive
your car at the same time,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
you are driving, which is number
one reality, physical reality,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
but texting is zero reality.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a function of the mind
and it is in your mind.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
When you're driving and
texting, you are neither driving

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
our texting because you have
cancelled your awareness

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
by simply bilocating
your senses.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
It says, if you are awake and in
a dream state at the same time.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
there is a time delay

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
similar to being asleep
and then waking up

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
when you move back into
and realize you are now

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
This example, is a big
picture of how humans today

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.375 align:middle line:84%
are transitioning to zero
reality more and more.

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And much more than number one
because of our smart devices

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and electronic interactions.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Here's the concern with that.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
There are potential
health issues

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
because of no longer knowing how
to relate to physical reality.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
case of video gamers,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
emotional interactions, physical
interactions, and relationships

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
go away because everything they
experience is in zero reality,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and the feedback
is all internal.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:90%
Feedback is good.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
It's an internal dialogue.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But physical feedback
is how we relate

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
with our current reality.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The reason why physical
reality is important

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:84%
is because you
must have balance.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
When people talk about being
a superhero and superhuman,

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
you can't just do that
in zero reality, fantasy,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.000 align:middle line:90%
and imagination.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to do that
in number one reality

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to really experience it.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You must be able to
master your thoughts

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and body at the same time.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:90%
There are a lot of disciplines--

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:84%
yoga and martial arts
being prime examples--

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
where this is not
only the process,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.225 align:middle line:84%
but is also the outcome
of those activities.

Extreme activeness
and zero reality

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:90%
is an extreme catatonic state.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Extreme activeness
in number one reality

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
would be a person without
empathy or thoughts or feelings

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and total physical
engagement with reality.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that you're able to
balance both zero and number

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:90%
one reality.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:10%
There is one truth, and that is
that zero reality is much more

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:10%
extensive.

What's that mean?

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It means that there are
dimensions of interactions that

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
have an extensive data set
that our mind and dreams set

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
interpret as reality.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%

So when you are in zero
reality, wandering around,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
even when you are sleeping,
spirit attachments

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
are in a different dimension
that attach you because we have

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.165 align:middle line:90%
energy and they need energy.

They are not actually giving you
information like the entities,

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:90%

Ghosts are not
exactly non-physical,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%

Let's take, for example,
praying to a god or goddess.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
That energy from the
people that pray gives life

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to a non-physical
entity, good or bad.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:10%
We could say Ra is
an old god, and I

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:10%
could go get a bunch of
people to pray for him,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and then the energy field
may or may not serve me.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:84%
The feedback from
that energy field

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
is based on how much
connectivity you

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:90%
have with that energy field.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:84%
In this sense, I have
given it new life.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:10%
This means constantly feeding
it with your energy and prayers

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:10%
so that consciousness
then becomes a bigger

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.430 align:middle line:10%
part of your own reality.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
This could be
helpful, but then you

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:90%
could also become subservient.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I teach that you should
not put your energy

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
towards non-physical
beings and instead

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
focus on internally knowing
who you are and being yourself.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
This will keep you safe and
create trust within yourself.

You need to align yourself with
the divinity of your choosing.

a god or goddess

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to help you align with
their consciousness for that

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
attribute that they
possess that you don't, you

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
have chosen to take
on that skill set.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:10%
You would put on a robe or
overlay of this god or goddess,

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.310 align:middle line:10%
but underneath you are still
your own consciousness.

You are acting within the

One of the easiest ways to
understand an energy vampire

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%

after the conversation,
turn around, face

a different direction,
and ask yourself,

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:84%
do I feel more energized or do
I feel more drained and more

are you withdrawn from

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:10%
using it as a focus
of your consciousness.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And as a focus of
your consciousness

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and with the right
frequency, you

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:84%
energize that object to take
the place of the need for you

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to defend yourself or
even to protect yourself.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, you free
your mind of this fearfulness.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And instead, you come
to some source of peace

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that,
you can achieve

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
a night of relaxation, a night
of sleep without any problems.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So these are very common,
but just remember,

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they do not work.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:90%
They are just tools.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And that the
activating principle

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:84%
is your own consciousness
and your own energy.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
The more energy you
put into something--

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
a ring, a crystal,
the more it vibrates,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:84%
the more that frequency retains
the idea that you have in mind

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:90%
that this is protective of me.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:90%

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So now we have an
internal dialogue

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
going on in the mind between
that which is positive

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:90%
and that which is negative.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
The way I explain it is
that that which is negative

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
feeds off negative
energy, whether it's

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
a thought, a being,
a non-physical being.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
It covers the whole spectrum.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.688 align:middle line:90%
They live off negative energy.

00:23:20.688 --> 00:23:22.230 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
other end, there's

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
people that live of positive
energy, and they radiate that.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
As you become more
aware and understanding

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
of energy in your life,
you become more aware

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of the positive or negative
nature of everything.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to demonize it.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be in judgment.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
We just need to know,
does this benefit me.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You should do things that
promote your own life

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:84%
If you feel you need
to protect yourself,

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
then you should do those
things that work for you.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:90%
It's extensive.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:84%
You can find something
that appeals to you.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And the appeal is that you
have some sort of affinity that

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
allows you to place your
consciousness and your energy

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.505 align:middle line:84%
into something that
affects your reality.

live in today, and by tuning
