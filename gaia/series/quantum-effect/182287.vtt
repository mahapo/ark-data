00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:10%
>> What does it mean
when someone says,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:10%
where are you from?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:10%
And where are you going?

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:10%
My name is Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:10%
For the past 40 years, I have
been a student of human health

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
and historical, traditional,
and contemporary medicine.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The historical
medicine teachings

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I use in my practice
centers around

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Chinese energetic medicine
and Native American medicine.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Still, knowledge
of Western medicine

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
is vital for understanding
the experiences and issues

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that people present as what they
are facing and need help with.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So in my work, I understand
people's conditions

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:90%
from a Western point of view.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But to really diagnose
the root of the problem,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to calibrate the
energetic states and the energy

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:84%
flow resulting in wherever
the condition lives.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
This means I'm
able to access all

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions in
which the client and/or

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:90%
the condition might exist.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I will explain
my theory of proximate reality

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and how that can
help us be more aware

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.655 align:middle line:84%
and knowledgeable about what we
are experiencing in our lives.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.407 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:34.844 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:10%
In 1989, I was practicing
a Kriya meditation,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:10%
which is a meditation that
combines focus, awareness,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:10%
mantras, and body positions.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
In this meditation, I was
expanding my awareness.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And my awareness brought me to
my presence in the universe.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
What I gathered
from this knowledge

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.700 align:middle line:84%
was a theory that was able
to explain that reality

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
is everywhere that you are not.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
You only occupy a very
small point of reality.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I called this the theory
of proximate reality.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So proximate reality
means that the center

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, you, occupies
a very unique part of reality.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
This theory explains that
your experiences are local.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And you are confined
to how far you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
can reach with your presence.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this reality
is situated away

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
from the center of the
universe, which is you.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
You exist as the
point of attachment

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to being yourself
in this reality.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The point of attachment
to this reality is you.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:84%
If you lose your point of
attachment, your body, you die.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So proximate reality is
the amount of reality

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that you are in contact with
or have a relationship with.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you expand
your consciousness,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
you are expanding the amount
of reality in your life.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if you are
living in Washington, DC,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:10%
it also means right
now, you do not

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:10%
have a physical reality
in Dallas, Texas, which

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:10%
means it doesn't exist for
you right now in your reality.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But your consciousness can
be anywhere in the universe.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You could switch your
presence in your mind,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning you can focus on
being in Dallas, Texas.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:10%
And in some degree, that
would mean you would be there.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:10%


00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:10%
However, it would not
be as strong as where

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:10%
your body is in Washington, DC.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The body is the antenna and
non-consciously picking up

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:10%
So when you are
physically in one place

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:10%
and you pick up information
from that reality,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:10%
it is only because it has
greater density of information.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The information
density is less when

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
you are in Dallas, Texas
with just your mind.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you are watching
a movie, for instance,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you are transported
into that consciousness.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And you forget where you
are in the world physically.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%
The movie theater disappears.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:90%
This is very similar.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So proximate reality allows
us to not be overwhelmed.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But it also limits the
information available to us

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
by restricting our
interactions with reality.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:10%
So it is an important
theory to explain

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:10%
so that we may understand
how to co-create and become

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:10%
more of ourselves and
have more presence

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:10%
in the physical
reality we occupy,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.189 align:middle line:10%
which equals more
interactiveness.

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So how do we co-create using
the proximate reality theory?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It is to bring
essence to presence.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It is to bring the entire
concept and unity of the self

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:90%
to one moment.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:90%
This sounds simple.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But it is the basis for
meditation and contemplation.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
This theory is
based on the ability

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to increase or decrease the
elements of our reality.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, let's
say you're married.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And you're at work.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Where is your significant other?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:90%
You're at work.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And he or she is not here.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:84%
These are examples
of both realities

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.120 align:middle line:84%
occurring at the same time, of
being in number one reality,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
being present in
a physical sense,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and being in zero reality, in
a imaginative or experiential

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:90%
sense.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have decreased
your information field

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to focus on creating what
you're doing currently.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So to co-create your
reality requires

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:84%
the presence of your
essence, yourself,

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
which we would
call consciousness.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you increase
presence, you

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
increase the intensity of
your experience of reality.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.475 align:middle line:84%
And that intensity can change
your proximate reality.

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the paths is called
the path of negation.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is the path
where you decrease

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:90%
the information coming to you.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But you intensify your
presence at the point

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of attachment to
that reality, which

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:90%
is your physical consciousness.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the duality
of reality and action.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
This validates your
ability to be in one place

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.255 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
two places at once.

00:07:58.255 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you want
to move to Dallas, Texas.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You're currently
in Washington, DC.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:10%
You use meditation techniques
to experience being in Dallas.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And we would call that intention
and imagination and fantasy

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and a whole lot of other things.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
But you would use
those techniques

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to experience being
in Dallas to the point

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that you feel you're
physically there.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
concept that is used

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:84%
in the idea of
advancing oneself,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:84%
not only intellectually,
but spiritually.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
This reality gets into
the zero and one duality,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:90%
the duality of reality.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality is the
mental, meditation,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and non-physical
aspects of existence.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And the number one reality
is everything physical.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
human existence is

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
based on the combination
of these two realities

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and the point of contact, or
the attachment to being alive.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we've
never been to Dallas.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're imagining what it
would be like to live there.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
This is all fantasy
until there is

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
movement in your mind in the
form of intent and actions.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mind can only get you so
far unless you're really good.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
You need to marry
the zero reality

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
fantasy with your physical
number one reality.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it would
be getting on a plane

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and going to Dallas to
check out where to live.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So zero reality sets your
mind on an attachment.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you need to catch
up with that reality

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
in number one, which is
to be physically there.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are people
that are that good.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
There are people that are
so trained in zero reality

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that they can get there
physically with only

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:90%
using their mind.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan monks, and
it has been alluded

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to in Native American
mythology also--

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:90%
that this capacity exists.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
What is alluded to in
the Egyptian embalming

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
practices is that
the pharaohs were

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
so good in doing
these types of things

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that they could come back
to physical existence.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
This was part of
their belief system.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
people preserved them.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
How are these groups of
people able to do that?

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They do this by projecting their
consciousness to another point

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:90%
of physicality.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
This takes years of
training of the mind

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to alter reality
with your consciousness.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So co-creating your
reality would first

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
start with being able
to alter your reality.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And you alter reality by
your own consciousness.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
You see this in
movies, especially

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:84%
"Star Wars," where the
Jedi is able to transfer

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
his physical body into a
battle scene somewhere else.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:84%
People take it to be fantasy,
but it's not exactly.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
There are exercises that focus
on Kundalini yoga and Kriya

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:84%
yoga that activate
the mind and the body

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
which increases

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
your awareness of
consciousness to be

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
interactive while,
at the same time,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
decreases the
information coming in.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can co-create
the reality you want.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:90%
How do you balance the two?

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's important to not
get lost on either side

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
of zero or number one reality.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
If you get lost in
number one reality,

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
you're totally focused
on the physical.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And you have no awareness,
no information coming in.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like you exist outside
of reality to a certain degree

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:84%
because you're so focused
on the physicality of what

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
If you get lost in
zero reality, we

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
say you're lost in anxiety,
which doesn't exist,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
or depression,
which doesn't exist.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist as a location.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
They exist as something
you participate in.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way,
you participate

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
in either zero or
number one reality

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to one degree or another.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The classic example
of this is if you

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%
were texting and driving.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Driving is a physical action.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It requires all the
inputs of your senses.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
you start texting,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:90%
you're into zero reality.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You're into that reality of the
thought and the imagination.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And people do not go back
and forth very easily.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:90%
There's a time lag.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Example of that is
when you daydream.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Somebody pokes you on the
shoulder and go, hey, hey, hey.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And you go, I was
somewhere else.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
texting and driving,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.520 align:middle line:84%
for instance, you're
somewhere else.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And that time lag can be deadly.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:13.292 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:10%
The first principle of
the martial arts I teach

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:10%
is awareness.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:10%
The second principle of
the martial arts I teach

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.010 align:middle line:10%
is balance.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:10%
You do not want to spend
too much time in either,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:10%
but be able to understand
how they work together

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:10%
and move you forward.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:84%
This means meditation
mixed with movement.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting because
it's not just martial arts.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Dance can be form of
meditation and movement.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Working can be a form of
meditation and movement

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:90%
combined.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think it
has to be some exotic form

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%
or have some exotic teacher.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But everyday activity
has the capacity

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
to be a meditation
and movement mix.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:10%
The third martial art I
teach is moment, which

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:10%
means timing under heaven.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:90%
We go from moment to moment.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Moment to moment is not time.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not seconds.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It's independent of time.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
relates to the movement

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
through Heaven and Earth,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Earth being the physical
reality of existence

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.315 align:middle line:84%
and Heaven being the meditative,
spiritual existence of reality.

00:15:58.315 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the most
important thing of the things

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I teach because every moment
gives you an opportunity.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You cannot account for
causality in reality.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
If we ask, where
did you come from,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:90%
the answer is, well, I was born.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you my
mother and father's name.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we start examining that
from a moment perspective,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.640 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very entertaining
because they had to meet.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:90%
They had to get together.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:10%
They had to be together
for you to be conceived.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what was
all the causality

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
that caused you to go somewhere
at a specific day and time?

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And you met your
significant other.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
You met your partner.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:84%
If you take all the
causality involved,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.936 align:middle line:84%
it's infinite because the other
person had to be there, too.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, the
place had to exist,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:84%
whether it was a church or a
bar or a park or anything else.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And then, well, wait a minute.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Their parents had to meet.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And this thing goes on
and on and on to the point

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's just too
much information.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And causality disappears
under the weight of that.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we limit
the amount of information

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that we participate in.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So a moment gives
you the opportunity

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to move from where you
are to the next moment.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So one of the trainings
in moment martial arts

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
is learning the meaning of a
moment, knowing when to move

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and when not to move.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:10%
The fourth martial art
I teach is movement.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:10%
It comes from a moment.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the mixture of
time, focus, and balance.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:10%
The fifth martial
art is momentum,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:10%
which means once you
head in that direction,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.131 align:middle line:10%
you keep moving
in that direction.

00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
This goes into physics and
the laws of thermodynamics,

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
which states the tendency
for an object in motion

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to stay in motion.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:90%
What's that mean?

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Look at it from the standpoint
of if we break that momentum.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
If you break that momentum, we
say, I don't know where I'm at.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Your momentum has been broken.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You have lost yourself.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Momentum is very
important in life

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:90%
because we go to the same job.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:90%
We go home to the same place.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We tend to do the same things.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So momentum could also
be explained as habits.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we do those without
any kind of mindfulness,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
then we are blind to the fact
that every moment provides us

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:90%
with opportunity.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
If we're aware of these
moments and our own momentum,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
we could then
anticipate and also make

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
choices about where we go and
what we do with much more ease.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is why it is important
for people to understand,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:84%
because it shows that we
all have the potential

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to change what is
going on in our lives

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and by being ourselves.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
point of attachment.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.235 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness is attached
to your physical body.

00:20:25.235 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
In the same way,
number one reality

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:90%
is your physical existence.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.125 align:middle line:84%
And your consciousness would
represent zero reality.

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But your point of
attachment moves.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.882 align:middle line:90%
Some days, you're more physical.

00:20:45.882 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Some days, you're more mental.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we move back and
forth, we create change.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:90%
We create change in our lives.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So paying attention,
focusing are

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
ideals that we use to
explain what we're doing

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
or how we're going
to do something.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually
insufficient to describe

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the movement of that
which is you yourself.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So people use words
like "soul" or "spirit."

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
language you use.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But there is
something independent

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:90%
of the physical existence.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done at
Harvard several years ago.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that
when you dream,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:84%
you take your
consciousness with you.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is your
senses are still operating.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And so those are dream states.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
same states that

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:84%
occur when we use meditation
and projective consciousness.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have moved our
point of attachment.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.790 align:middle line:84%
But that point of attachment
is attached to our body

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
In Hindu, it's called a Bindu
point, the point of attachment.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:84%
In a Japanese martial
arts, it's called Hara--

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
refers to where you are
centered in your body.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting that
you are centered in yourself.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:90%
You are balanced or you're not.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
If your center of
your consciousness

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
is outside your body, you have
basically abandoned your body.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But we never abandon,
for the most part,

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that which is our
attachment to life itself.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It is the primary directive
that we maintain this body

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.800 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible because
it's our engine which

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:84%
we use to interact with
all physical reality.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Without that
physical reality, we

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
have no particular basis to
experiencement because we

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:90%
are absent our senses.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in a soul form
or spirit form, you can observe.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But you may not be
able to experience.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The reality of zero
is just as important

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:84%
as the physical reality
that everybody experiences

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and wants to relate to.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:84%
External martial
arts, which is what

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
people see in all the
movies, is external reality.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:90%
It's number one reality.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the physical.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But there is
another martial art.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is called
internal martial arts.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Internal martial arts equates
with meditation, contemplation,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and exploring the
universe that exists

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
as an experiential universe.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:10%
Now that we have gone through
how to balance the two,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.490 align:middle line:10%
understanding the
universe inside us

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:10%
requires this balance.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Understanding this principle
of zero-one reality

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
will help you move
into healing yourself.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,

Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%

elements that help you get back

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
to your original self.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:25:02.742 align:middle line:90%
