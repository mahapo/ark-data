00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a very famous ad
campaign that says, got milk?

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe we need
to have a new ad

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:90%
campaign that says, got energy?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Randy
Veitenheimer, I believe

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:10%
nothing is going
to heal you more

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
than the energy you create for
and from your current reality.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I will
go through the practices

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of feeding
your own energy field.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully this will help
you obtain optimal health

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.925 align:middle line:90%
Let's discuss how this works.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
Most people lack energy
and are unable to maintain

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:10%
an optimal existence in reality.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Lack of energy manifests as
illness, problems, and issues.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They show up in the body
as internal conflict

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
when your energy doesn't
match the incoming energy

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
or information.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:10%
All functions of the body
operate on electron flow--

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:10%
on energy.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have enough,
then these systems

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.250 align:middle line:84%
experience phenomena
similar to having

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
a dimmer switch on
that particular aspect

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:90%
of your existence.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
In an article published by the
University of Maryland recently

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
they talk about energy
in the body this way.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The elements in our body-- like
sodium, potassium, calcium,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and magnesium--

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
have a specific
electrical charge.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the chemical basis for
life that they're promoting.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of our cells can use
these charged elements called

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
ions to generate electricity.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:84%
That is true, but there's
also outside energy flows

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that also contribute to
our overall energy content.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The contents of the
cell are protected

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
from the outside environment
by a cell membrane.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Our energy field is protected
by a similar membrane.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I have given it the
name of a event horizon.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Just like your skin is the limit
of your physical existence,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:84%
your event horizon,
the absolute limit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
of your electronic or
electromagnetic field,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
is also a barrier to other
information or other energy

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:90%
flows.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
The cell membrane is
made up of lipids,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and they create a barrier
that only certain substances

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:84%
can cross to reach
the cell interior.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we think of the human
body and the human energy field

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
in the same way?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't we set
up our energy field

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and do practices that allow for
the energetic interaction that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
occurs at the limit of our
energy field to be selective

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and to not allow that
which is destructive,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it be a flu
virus or whether it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
be a negative thought?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Not only does the cell
membrane function as a barrier

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to molecules, it
also acts as a way

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.220 align:middle line:84%
for the cell to generate
electrical currents.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is also true of
your electromagnetic field.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Your interactions create
an electrical flow

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.920 align:middle line:84%
through your own
electrical circuits,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
your own electrical
currents through the body,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and that is the source of
a large part of our energy

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:90%
that comes from outside us.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's also energy
created inside us.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Resting cells are negatively
charged on the inside.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're negatively charged
on the inside of your energy

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
field, what are you
going to attract?

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
You attract negativity.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Like attracts like.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
While the outside environment
is more positively charged,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
while this may be
true in ourselves,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:84%
it may not be true
in our environment.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
The tendency is for humans
to have a negatively charged

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that
you see somebody

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
who exists in a positively
charged environment

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
inside and out.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural occurrence
up to about six years old,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
but then we tend to lose
it so it becomes something

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have to look for,
something to be sought out

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
in the form of gurus, in
the form of teachings,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:90%
in the form of practices.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The attempt in all
of these things

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.635 align:middle line:90%
is to find some sort of balance.

00:04:52.635 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So we look at what
goes on in the cells,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
we can say the same thing
for the human energy field.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.220 align:middle line:90%
There are slight imbalances.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendency to
be positive or negative.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Cells can achieve
this charge separation

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
by allowing charged
ions to flow in

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and out through the membrane.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's think about
that as the mind itself.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
The mind receives and
transmits thoughts

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of a positive and
negative nature.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The flow of charges
across the cell membrane

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is what generates
electrical currents.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
If we look at that,
we can say the charges

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and flow of energy across
the human energy field

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:84%
creates our thoughts
and our emotions.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Cells control the flow of
specifically charged elements

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
across the membrane
with proteins

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that sit on the cell surface
and create and operate

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
for certain ions
to pass through.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:10%
This is called cellular
receptivity and receptor sites.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:90%
We do the same thing.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We come with a set of programs
or acquire those programs

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that determine what cellular
openings, what receptor

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:90%
sites are available to us.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's why we reject certain
concepts, or ideas, or things,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%
or foods just outright.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the right concept,
but ions are not life force.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
They're just a
different energy form.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So what is life force compared
to ionic flow, neutrino flow,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and electron flow,
and particle physics,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and similar components?

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Life force cannot be
defined by particle physics.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It is the finite
describing the infinite.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science seems intent
on breaking apart the universe

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.980 align:middle line:90%
into smaller and smaller parts.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If we take an
entire human being,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
we would break it
down into organs,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and then we would break
it down into molecules,

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and from molecules to atoms,
and from atoms to subatomic,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and from the
subatomic to quantum

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.000 align:middle line:84%
flow, and quantum information
flows, quantum energy flows.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Then we would now
get to sub quantum.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep going we get to
dark energy, and at that point

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:90%
you've lost everybody.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Because how the whole
functions is really life force,

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and it is a part
of consciousness,

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and it is an aspect
of the universe

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that all these things
do not explain.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
While you can separate out those
type of energy forces and flows

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
in the body, you cannot say
that they are the reason

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
or the source of our existence.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
As a healer, we work
with life force.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
We may work with all
the different energies

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
that are referred to in
fourth level physics--

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
particle physics,
quantum physics--

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately we're
working with life force.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a different energy.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
It may be inclusive of
everything we've talked about,

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
but is not separate,
and it is also not

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
complete with the
level of physics

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:90%
we currently understand.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
that around the world,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
other people have approached
this from different viewpoints.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:10%
Konstantin Korotkov in Russia
and some of his associates

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:10%
have decided to work
with life force itself.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
They've done it with people who
have extreme physical issues.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were born
without eyesight,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and yet as part of
their studies they

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
were able to develop
in a person the ability

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to see using their life force,
using their energy field.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Additional studies they
did were on dead people.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:10%
The idea that there
is energy in the body

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:10%
and that its form has
some sort of existence,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:10%
some sort of physicality
which is not explained just

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:10%
in the physical nature of the
soul but as an etheric form,

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:10%
as an energy form that exists
prior to and after you die.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
He wants to find the
receptacle for life.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin's efforts
and experiments

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:90%
are very good reading.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They're something that I
think people should become

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
familiar with in the same way
that Elisabeth Kubler-Ross

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:90%
wrote "On Death and Dying."

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
These are all subjects that
explore the life force--

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
they don't explore
quantum physics--

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:90%
as it applies to human beings.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So why is this important
for you to know?

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if you know you can
start to separate your body

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:84%
energy from life
force energy, you

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:84%
can separate zero
and one reality.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I use this as a viewpoint
to say if you can step back

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.030 align:middle line:10%
to where you can look
and see zero reality--

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:10%
your thoughts, your feelings,
what kind of behavior

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
you're exhibiting--

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:10%
and then look at the
physical reality around you,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:10%
you have an ability to interact
with them greater than if you

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:10%
cannot adopt that viewpoint
of being an observer.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So how do you
separate the energy

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that flows through the
body versus the energy

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that you express
through the body?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Viewpoint.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
To be able to step back
and observe yourself.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
primary requirements

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to pursue
any kind of enlightenment

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.505 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of understanding of
really what it means to exist.

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
The highest form
of enlightenment

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:26.358 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize energy as its
existence, not as its presence.

00:11:26.358 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that you would have

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to sit, and study, and try to
come to some understanding of.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Life force is neither
created or destroyed,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:90%
it is only transformed.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are the vessel or vehicle
for how that energy comes

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
into the universe and how it
is spread out or transformed

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:90%
when we express it.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
We take raw life force
and I express it as Randy.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You take raw life force
and express it as yourself.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
better by developing

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
an internal landscape
that includes

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
the infinite energy of the
universe as your potential.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
This means realizing that
you are one with the creator.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do this, you
are absent of the creator

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and you are separate
from the true self.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And what can happen is long
term deficiencies equal illness

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
or failure of the systems in
the body because of the blocking

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:90%
or lack of flow of life force.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
To get out of your
separation, you

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
can change your interactions.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You can have interactions
with the body.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
You can have interactions
with your environment.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the steps you
can take that ultimately lead

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to some transformation
of your consciousness

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to
express your life force.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
All self-help books are in some
way trying to remove the blocks

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
or trying to give
you a program that

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:90%
lets you move forward in life.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you are truly yourself,
you really don't need them.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Physical exercises, martial
exercises, mental exercises--

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
are energy flows.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:90%
It's ultimately all we can say.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
We give meaning
to them, and we'll

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.200 align:middle line:84%
call them emotional
interactions,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
we'll call them
mental interactions,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it love, we'll call
it everything in the universe,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and all we're referring to
is the level of consciousness

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
of the expression of the energy
that flows and comes out of us.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The energy that flows into
us is 100% life force.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The energy that
flows out of us is

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
one that is colored or
filtered through our emotions,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.655 align:middle line:84%
through our habits, through our
programming, through our memory

00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:14.455 align:middle line:90%
more than anything.

00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.440 align:middle line:84%
We experience an increase of
energy because of interactions

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that if we can

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
take a viewpoint
of non-judgement,

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we take a viewpoint of stepping
back, and ultimately to have

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:84%
the viewpoint of the
observer, and to be

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
able to listen, and
to be able to see

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
our environment without our
input of our experiences,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and our history, and
our memory gives us

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.295 align:middle line:90%
a pure sight into life itself.

00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:10%
To be fully human--

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:10%
to be energized-- is to be able
to use people, plants, animals,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:10%
ideas, thoughts,
feelings, interactions--

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:10%
to be able to use
everything as a mirror--

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:10%
as a reflection of life itself--

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:10%
not just you, but life itself--

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:10%
and to be able to look
in those mirrors and go,

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:10%
oh, this is what's going on.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
it applies to me.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
That is to be able
to separate yourself

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
long enough to be able to
make changes in direction.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
If you're sick, see
yourself being sick.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're happy see
yourself being happy.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Just the scene of
yourself creates

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.300 align:middle line:84%
a change in your
electromagnetic frequency,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
it creates a change
in your vibration,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
it creates a change
in your consciousness.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So now that you know some ways
to activate your life force,

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
you need to be able to
be cautious of using

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.725 align:middle line:84%
other people's life
force to increase yours.

00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
We call these
energetic vampires.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
out there knows

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:90%
somebody who fits that bill.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
How do you find out who's
an energetic vampire?

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the easiest
thing in the world.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It refers to your etheric field,
it refers to your limbic field

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
or limbic system in the body, it
refers to your proximity sense.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
All three of these things
react to a negative energy flow

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:90%
no matter what its form is.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to
do is ask yourself

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
when you meet somebody, or think
something, or see something,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:84%
do I feel better
or do I feel worse?

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
Do I feel energized or
do I feel de-energized?

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple thing,
but what it does

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is start allowing you to
recognize the universe

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and the environment you live
in, and out of recognition

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:90%
can come understanding.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't need negative
people in your life.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Actually, you do.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Negative people allow
you to examine yourself.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
You just don't need
to hang out with them

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:84%
because the loss of energy can
result in depression or anxiety

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
If you do not have enough energy
and you attempt to help others,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
you will become
energetically bankrupt.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:90%
We call them enablers.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It's people who
are enablers that

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
keep bankrupting their own
energy field to help somebody

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
else, generally somebody who
either doesn't want to be

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
helped or can't be helped.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But we do it out of programs
of they're my family,

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or they're my relations,
or they're somebody

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I need to help.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
All of these statements
reflect a negative state

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They reflect that you are also
needing energy because you

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%
get energy from helping others.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.360 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's an ego help,
that's an ego energy flow,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:90%
and it's not sustainable.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The only thing sustainable
is your connection

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to the life force
of the universe,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and you should devote
yourself to some practice that

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
allows you to, number one,
be yourself; number two,

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
be connected to yourself;
and out of that position

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be
connected to the universe

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and to the entire flow
of energy of life itself.

00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:90%
This is being selfish.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:90%
You need to be selfish.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
The selfish self in
our society, we're

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
programmed that that's kind
of a horrible human being.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But really, to be selfish
is to take care of yourself.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:84%
It is to be energized, it
is find some sort of joy

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
about being alive
and being happy

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.250 align:middle line:84%
instead of relating
to your problems

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and relating to other
people's problems.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
If you are joyful about
your own existence,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
you have the energy--
you have excess energy.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We see it in all
people that are joyful.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Those people have the greatest
potential to help somebody

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:84%
not if you're down
and out, now if you're

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
in a negative emotional state
or a negative environment.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of books and
lots of teachers on this.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.635 align:middle line:84%
You need to be able to help
yourself before helping others.

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Most negative
drains on the energy

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:84%
field itself are the result
of the emotions primarily

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
and the thoughts secondarily--

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:84%
not the efforts of
the physical body.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Emotions will drain you.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:10%
They will totally leave you
on the floor with no energy,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:10%
and the recovery
time can be days.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:10%
It can be weeks.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Thinking will do the same thing.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever studied
late into the night,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
your actual mental
processes will wear you out.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
You will burn off all
the water in the body.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Your brain will
become dehydrated.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It is not even
energy at that point,

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
your physicality has lost
its presence and ability

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to transfer energy from
the field through your self

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and out as an expression
of your activity.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
These are energy
statements and assessments

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.435 align:middle line:90%
of your energy existence--

00:21:03.435 --> 00:21:04.235 align:middle line:90%
your life force.

00:21:04.235 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Proposing a new model of
reality where emotions can live

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
requires recognition.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Just the act of recognition
that emotions are not us

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
gives you an opportunity
to advance yourself

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in life and to not
be so participatory

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:90%
against your will.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
You are an evolutionary
space-time event.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
This is existence that
finds form in life.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Your evolution will
always come first,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
but you must have a recognition
of your ego identity

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and know that it is not the
totality of your existence.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
When you recognize
your emotions,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
you don't participate
in them to the extent

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that you lose your
identity and consciousness

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're only
left with your ego.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have a
conversation with your ego.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
This is important because this
is the step of recognition

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and the step of observation.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:90%
It is also a place.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
If you can develop that
place in your consciousness

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:90%
where you can observe yourself--

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
two of the first
exercises that I

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
give people is to be able to
see yourself-- to see yourself

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:84%
as you are and see yourself as
you interact with everything

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:90%
in your environment.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the ability to
learn from yourself--

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
in the same, way to be
able to hear yourself.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what
you say to people.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Listen to what other people say.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the sounds
of the universe,

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:84%
whether they be music, or
plants, or anything else.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:90%
This is how you learn.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So understanding the difference
between body energy and life

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.490 align:middle line:84%
force, body energy is your
expression of life force.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Life force is independent and
flows through the human body.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It is important so that you
know how much energy you really

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.860 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
You can either not
have enough input

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:90%
or you can have too much output.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:90%
This is balance.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
martial art I teach,

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and it directly refers to
how much energy you have

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
and how much energy you express.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Once you know how
much energy you have,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you can use it to heal
yourself particularly

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:84%
if you have excess,
particularly if you

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
take the time to not express
energy in an outward fashion,

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:90%
but to actually stop--

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to put a hold on the
expression of that energy.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we call it meditation.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call
it contemplation.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But in these states,
you actually still

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
flow energy-- life
force-- through yourself,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
expressing all of it.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
The excess becomes
available to you.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So really it's not to
not express energy,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to not interact, to hold back,
it's really to give yourself

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
some time to develop a charge--

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to charge your body up,
to charge yourself up,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to not restrict yourself
and the flow of that life

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:90%
force through you.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So that when the
opportunity occurs

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:84%
you're able to express yourself
in the best way you can,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
which is being yourself.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The other things
we covered today

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:84%
was to identify the biggest
strain of our life force

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:90%
which is emotions.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
With the ability to
control our participation,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:84%
then we can control
our life force itself.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I hope I was able to shed
some light on recognizing

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
your emotional body
as a separate system

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and in
doing so help you control it.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Up next we dive deeper
into the energetic ocean

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds you.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.286 align:middle line:90%
