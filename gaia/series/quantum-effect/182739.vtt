>> Have you ever wondered
how human you might be?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Has it ever crossed
your mind that you

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:84%
have a very small
percentage of Humanness?

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Humanness is defined as
Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
which is our form.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But it is also a
holographic field form.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So our physical body is a place
holder of humanness, parasites,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:90%
and symbiotic interactions.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Which begs the question,
how human are you really,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
if other life forms make
up part of your existence

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
in this physical body?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the totality of the
human physical existence.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I
will explain and define

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:10%
what it means to be
human in physical form.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And how much of your existence
in physical form is not human.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I will also define
what is transhuman.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And how that correlates
to your humanness

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and the symbiotic nature
of the physical universe.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.188 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:42.668 align:middle line:90%

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:10%
When someone says the word
symbiotic, what does that mean?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:10%
It means we are participatory.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
The human body is
symbiotic with life force.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
The human body does
not create life force.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
It connects with it in different
ways and different degrees.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The life force is
the primary force

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in the universe for
all forms of life.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
But the life force itself
is independent of all forms

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Your human body is made up
of fungus, yeast, bacteria,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:90%
cellular creatures.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
A human body is a host for other
life in the universe that needs

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to exist in the human form.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
These lifeforms that inhabit
your body have consciousness

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and life force, also.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, how does a cancer
exist in the human body?

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It draws energy from the host--

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But it also draws life
force unto itself.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Cancer and all
other diseases exist

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.098 align:middle line:90%
by virtue of this connection.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:10%
Cancer and illnesses are
deviations from a normal course

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:10%
of existence.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
When it deviates, it
has been influenced

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
by either, number one reality,
the physical reality we

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:90%
exist in.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Or zero reality, the
mental, non-physical reality

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:90%
that we participate in.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Number one reality,
physical reality

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:90%
would be environmental--

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:90%
toxins, radiation, et cetera.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:10%
Our zero reality,
non-physical reality

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:10%
are thoughts,
relationships, et cetera.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:10%
And all this is going on
inside the human form,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:10%
which is not static.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are
in a constant frenzy

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.474 align:middle line:84%
of cellular activity, which
is interactive at all times.

00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:27.074 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:29.509 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment,
we are in a progression

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:90%
of hierarchical processes.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Number one in this process
is you need to breathe.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
This is primary
to consciousness.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
To have consciousness
itself, breath is necessary.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.135 align:middle line:90%
Number two, you need water.

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:90%
And number three, you need food.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
These are primary to
the hierarchical needs

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
of the body's existence.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
From these needs, we have
pranayama, hydration,

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition emerging
as disciplines.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something you
consciously think about.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because our human
form is specifically

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.595 align:middle line:84%
generated for experiential
knowledge outside ourselves,

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:35.395 align:middle line:90%
not inside.

Our life form supports
other forms of life

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.215 align:middle line:84%
that have become integrated over
time to support life itself.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
If we got rid of all of
our bacteria, we would die.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
symbiotic with them,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and we can't live without them.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We start life as a zygote,
and become a symbiote.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
When you say I am
human, now we need

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
to define how
human you are given

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the amount of parasitic
forms and bacteria

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.280 align:middle line:90%
populations in your body.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
we find out that

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
the parasites have independent
consciousness from you.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And in sufficient amounts that
can influence human behavior.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:90%
For example, do you crave sugar?

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Or does the yeast in
your body crave sugar?

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Cancer cells-- as an example--

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:90%
apparently crave sugar.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Or they may not crave sugar.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
They may be under the
influence of a concentrated

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, such as
yeast, viruses, bacteria,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
or parasites.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
All the above have been
identified by Western medicine

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
as contributors or sources
of disease and illness.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
One of these symbiotes might
have a stronger life force

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that at some point
is able to influence

other cellular activities
and functions in the body

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%

They were things such as
worms and other lifeforms.

That when asked what they
were, he said we have no clue.

They have not been
identified by science yet.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
This is an example

does not mean they do not

and 45% of cancer deaths
in the United States

And thus, could be preventable.

up with the estimates

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%

Cigarette smoking--
for instance--

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:84%
it reduces oxygen,
and increases CO2.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Parasites that are of a plant
nature, such as yeast, that

thrive in a positive
CO2 environment

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%

However, either you have
acquired an outside yeast

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
or you have promoted its
growth beyond status.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The yeast can grow by
various forms of sugar, CO2,

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and certain trace
mineralization.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
If the conscious of
the yeast requires

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
growth and your form of
feeding it would be smoking,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
then it would promote the
formation of a habit for it

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it would take
over your consciousness,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and drive your choices.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have
picked up smoking,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the yeast has influenced
my synaptic responses.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I have an addiction
to feeding my yeast.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The nicotine has now
induced and altered

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:90%
my neurological environment.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And may result in excess
intake of that drug, alcohol,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
or other substances.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Your need for
these certain items

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.320 align:middle line:84%
was created because a living
creature inside of you

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.045 align:middle line:84%
is influencing your decision
making for its own survival.

00:12:15.045 --> 00:12:19.436 align:middle line:90%

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a diet low in
fruits and vegetables.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Low dietary calcium, low fiber--

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:84%
this means that we
are predisposing

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to potentially support
cancer and other diseases.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:90%
But take the Eskimos in Alaska--

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:84%
vegetable and fruits are
in short supply there.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:84%
However, their blood
work comes back normal.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Because a human being has
the ability to pull anything

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
they need to survive from the
field itself to some degree.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
How do they acquire
and drive life force

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:90%
without proper nutrition?

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
They are able to
pull things they

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:90%
need into their physical form.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They are not under a
collective consciousness

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:19.495 align:middle line:84%
that requires them to eat fruits
and vegetables to survive.

00:13:19.495 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Which means they
do not fall victim

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
to the symbiotic
nature of their bodies

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
because they don't subscribe
to the collective consciousness

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:90%
that prevails.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And is represented
by proximate reality.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if we
go back to smoking--

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:84%
another patient
might be conditioned

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
in their social
circles to not smoke.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, they would not
create an environment high

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:10%
in CO2.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But the person might
love to eat donuts.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of behavior
is conditioned as OK.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And our free will
is our consciousness

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:90%
acting within the field.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
When we exercise
our free will, we

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
are acting freely of our
symbiotic relationships,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.310 align:middle line:84%
to some degree, with a
bacteria, parasite, fungus, et

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:84%
cetera that are
part of our being.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has cancer
cells, but the use

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition,
supplements, and medicine

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
allows us to keep up
with the cancer cells.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.677 align:middle line:84%
And does not allow
them to proliferate.

00:14:28.677 --> 00:14:35.008 align:middle line:90%

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.525 align:middle line:84%
How do we know the symbiotes
are influencing our behavior?

00:14:46.525 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever feel
off, sick, or sad?

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
These are influences
on your behavior.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:10%
This is where you need
to be participatory

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:10%
with your own body.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't separate yourself
from your symbiotic nature.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But you can explore your
body and its functions

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
through strengthening
your awareness of what

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.795 align:middle line:90%
is happening inside.

00:15:15.795 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You can do this through
meditation, visualization,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and seriously happy thoughts.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.930 align:middle line:84%
This means practicing
joy, for example.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Joyfulness as a level
of consciousness

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:90%
overrides a lot of illness.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
If you understand that there's
only a certain percentage

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
of you that is of humanness
and the rest is symbiotic,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
then you can increase
conscious interactions

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:90%
with your own body.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You can become aware of certain
thoughts, certain cravings,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and certain needs that
may not be your own.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But actually, may belong to
another living consciousness

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.620 align:middle line:84%

you for its survival.

Let's take the definition
of transhumanism--

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the belief or theory
that the human race

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
can evolve beyond its
current physical and mental

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
limitations, especially by
means of science and technology.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:10%
Having and comprehending
advanced technology,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:10%
but not having the
experience to deal

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:10%
with the totality of reality
means that technology may not

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:10%
be able to help
change or actually

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:10%
contribute to the future of
humanity and its evolution.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:10%
Technology has created
many replacement parts

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:10%
for the human body.

When we have replacement
parts in our bodies,

these parts and new AI
technology additions

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:10%
can create a
consciousness of its own.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
It would be a technology-based
consciousness.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
Biological consciousness
runs off of bioelectricity.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And has different signature
than the mechanical technology

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Tech runs on a
different energy--

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, an
artificial heart.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.150 align:middle line:84%
While they mimic
the functions, they

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
do not cover the
full spectrum of what

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:90%
a natural heart is and does.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
fallacy of technology.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Think of the artificial
heart experiencing love.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have that function.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
It would be inexpressible to
influence the system the way

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:90%
a real one would.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Just like the parasites,
bacteria, et cetera,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
these artificial pieces
disrupt the natural energy flow

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
The technology seems to apply
mostly to the physical form.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Because technology doesn't
apply to the experiential nature

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of what it means
to be human itself.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Humanity with its
collective consciousness

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and human beings with their
individual consciousness

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:90%
are not technologically-based.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Even if we take all the science
and produce a human form,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
we still have not produced human
consciousness to inhabit it.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanism through
technological means

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
wants to extend human life.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:10%
I have not found in
the last 40 years,

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:10%
working with thousands of people
that over time, human evolution

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:10%
increases in its
present physical form.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Each individual does not
evolve in a physical form.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
We have it in front of us--

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:90%
your physical body deteriorates.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:84%
We have done nothing
to expand and evolve

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness that would
show up as an enlightenment,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
as a form of transcendence,
as a form of ascension.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Something that would
show evolutionary support

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:90%
for all of humanity.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is not homogeneous
throughout the human body.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, throughout
human history,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.130 align:middle line:84%
there have been many attempts
to attribute or allocate

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
different aspects
of our consciousness

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:90%
to different parts of our body.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:10%
So we use chakras as an example.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:10%
The heart chakra as something
that expresses love.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the
heart experiences grief.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Grief is the reversal of love.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It is what causes us to fold in
on ourselves when we experience

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
the loss of a person, or a pet,
or something important to us.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to
the lower back,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
the sacral area of the body.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.950 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot
of anger, we would

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
say, oh do you have any
pain in your lower back?

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
All of these are attempts
to find consciousness

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.230 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:84%
We attribute the shoulders
with taking on burdens.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Carrying the weight of
other person's expectations.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have all our
emotions that we can assign

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:90%
to different parts of the body.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
It's why we say consciousness
is not homogeneous.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We assign different importance
to various organs, then

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
functions, then
parts of the body.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
what we're doing

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
is facilitating
the flow of energy

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
from our unconscious
mind into our brain.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, into our body.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And the reverse of it is
to experience life itself.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's why life is experiential.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's experiential
with a physical form.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:02.747 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:05.242 align:middle line:90%

00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Bioelectricity in
the human body--

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the life force itself is
the biological expression

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of energy transformation
in the human body.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It's why we can't plug
ourselves into 120-volt outlet

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.070 align:middle line:90%
in the wall.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
That electron flow that's
signature of that energy flow

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:90%
is not life-supporting.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It's my understanding
that the human life

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.920 align:middle line:84%
force itself is not
only transcendent,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
but permeates the
entire universe.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Look at the extension of how
many different forms of life

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
exist just on this planet.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The idea that life force
permeates the entire universe

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
gives credence to the
idea that there has

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:90%
to be life on other planets.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There has to be life everywhere
that there is physical matter.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Because physical matter also
employs and uses life force.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:90%
The planet has its life force.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:90%
The rocks have their life force.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:90%
This is discernible.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But only for people
who have taken the time

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.790 align:middle line:90%
to try to understand it.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Make contact with it.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, become
interactive with it.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
These are our elders
in Native Americans.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
These are our shamans.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
These are people who have
evolved their consciousness

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to the point that they
can be interactive.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Not just with another
human, but to actually

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
be interactive with all of
life, whether it's plant,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.120 align:middle line:90%
or animal, or mineral.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
They all have life
force being expressed

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of their
existence, just like you.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've been
able to show you

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
what makes you
human and unhuman,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
you have the tools to
know what part of you

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:84%
is influencing your
conscious feel.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:90%
we dive into what creation is.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And how you can
become a creator.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%
