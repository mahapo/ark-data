00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:90%
The short answer is no.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:10%
And today I would
like to discuss

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
death and transformation.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:10%
Very few of us remember
our birth or when we die.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:10%
Memory, birth, death,
and imagination

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:10%
are insufficient in life
and fail to provide us

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:10%
with a foundation for living.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
In simple terms, it is the
absence of the physical self.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
In physics, energy cannot
be created or destroyed.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Life can neither be
created nor destroyed.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like energy, it
can only be transformed.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Death in physics
terms is the loss

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
form of existence,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
just as birth is the creation of
the physical form of existence.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But what does the loss of
the physical form mean?

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to start at the
beginning of it all.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Your pre-existences
are a form of life

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:90%
without form, zero reality.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You exist as some consciousness,
some aspect of the universe.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Your physical
existence is a form

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of the formless in Chinese
philosophy and Taoism.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Your death is the loss
of the physical form

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
but not the essence of
you, which is life itself,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:90%
our being.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Life is an expanding
state of awareness.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Death is an evolving
expression of growth.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Both are marked by emergence--

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
life into physical
awareness and death

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
into universal, our
infinite awareness.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Life is an imminent
state of being.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
Death is a transcendent
state of being.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:90%
So it is zero reality.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So we go from a transcendent,
non-physical state

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:90%
of beingness--

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
basically essence-- to an
eminent and present state

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
of existence--

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:90%
physicality.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we go back to a
transcendent, non-physical

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:90%
state of being.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
You are always in a state of
being and a state of beginning.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't change.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
From a quantum
physics point of view,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
beingness is a high
probability-wave state

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:90%
of high potential energy.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.665 align:middle line:84%
How we come into
existence is a problem

00:03:33.665 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
I've presented to several
physicists in my life.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me the totality
of the energy required

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.050 align:middle line:84%
to create 8 pounds of matter
in the form of a human being?

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond comprehension.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Our physics can't explain it.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that the
collapse of the probability

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:90%
wave-energized state is you.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
As a human being, life
comes into existence

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
in its physical
form even though it

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
exists before and after
in a transcendent form.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
The expansion of the
physical into a non-physical

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:84%
existence, death, is the
release and the transformation

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
of physical matter form into
an energy state not of death,

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:90%
but of life itself.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Because life really hasn't
changed by the absence

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Conversion from
matter to energy,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
transformation of the
potential physical matter,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
life, into pure
energy, death, knowing

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
that energy is life itself
becomes a better concept.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Conception is an
energetic event.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Life is an accumulation
of information and matter.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Death is the release
of this matter,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
but not the release
of the information.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The death of matter is not
the absence of the self,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
but the continuation of the
information and experience

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:90%
of having lived.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:90%
All of life is about living.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
All life is therefore sacred.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:90%
What about reincarnation?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:90%
What's the mechanism of storage?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
What is the mechanism of
transfer of that information?

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Where is potentiality stored?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
All these questions are
not answered in physics.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have the
term "reincarnation"

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that encompasses all that in
basically an unexplained way.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:90%
This is my opinion.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation is
one of those things

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:90%
we know that we don't know.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:90%
It is a known unknown.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It has no hard
science behind it.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It's an attractive ideal that
you would take whoever you are.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
come back to whoever

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
you were and kind
of pick up where

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:90%
you left off in the last book.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know if
those memories are yours.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if you
are pulling those

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
from the entire
information field,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
from the entire energetic
field of the universe.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We do know that you can
pull that information.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so those people we call
"psychics" or "channelers"--

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
they're picking up
information flows.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They are contacting that
information as it existed.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:10%
One of the nice things
about being alive and dying

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:10%
is your essence carries
some form of memory.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that memory is
not exactly your own.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It's memory that is
uploaded to the universe

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
or to the collective
conscious of humanity.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And so because there's
multiple places of memory,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.825 align:middle line:84%
it is impossible to say you
were reincarnated as whoever.

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Even though it is
attractive and we

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
seem to get some
juice or energy out

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of continuity
and the physical form,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
there is no continuity
of the physical form.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
There is only continuity
of the energetic form.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Zero reality exists
and has continuity.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Number-one reality
is always transformed

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and is always transcended.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We can take a look at a person
as layers of information,

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:90%
layers of memory.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
We can take a look
at them as layers

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of density, information density,
layers of information flow.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And also we can look at them
as layers of dimensions.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
easiest way to explain

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the dimensionality
of a human being

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.870 align:middle line:84%
is to refer to it as
like our school system.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:90%
I went to grade 1 through 12.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:10%
I would have 12 dimensions
of understanding,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:10%
or knowledge, or experience.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Your dimensionality is
actually set at birth.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:90%
But it's not limited.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Why were you born only into,
say, 16 or 18 dimensions,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
which would to me include all
people born before about 1980?

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:90%
That was all that was required.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about
our life as something

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:84%
that was needed, something
that coalesced out

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, something
that represents a quantum

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
collapse into a potentiality,
into existence as something

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
the universe needed.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So then in keeping
with evolution,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.495 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't it make sense
that at some point somebody

00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
would be born with
additional dimensions--

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:84%
additional dimensions of
interaction, information flows,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.635 align:middle line:90%
access, talent, skills?

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
are transcendent.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
There are things that are
outside the current morphic

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:90%
field or the current reality.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:90%
And they keep expanding.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
In current language, we call it
"expansion of consciousness."

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is strictly
an interactive process

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that we use in conjunction with
the universe or in reality.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't there be a need
for additional or evolutionary

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
change in the
amount of dimensions

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:90%
that a human being can access?

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It really gives rise to the
potential of enlightenment,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
the potential of
transference, transformation.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
All of it is contained
in this whole concept

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that you are a certain
number of dimensions

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:90%
that you were born into.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But through processes-- yoga,
martial arts, meditation--

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.475 align:middle line:84%
there are ways to
expand your reality.

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
To me, the question
becomes, what

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is going on in the
universe that requires

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
us to now have children that
have 20 or 23 dimensions?

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And is there an end to it?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately to look
out ahead and say,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
what does a human being that
has 30 dimensions look like?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%
What is their capacity?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Can we explain now
things like intuition?

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Can we explain mental telepathy?

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Can we explain all
kinds of phenomena

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that come out of the
result of the expansion

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness and the
expansion of our connection

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:90%
to the entire universe?

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The idea of dimensionality
is something

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I came up with when I
started calibrating.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
How present are you
in this universe?

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
came another idea

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
that you actually have
memory fields also.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:84%
If you combine these two, we
can take a look at something

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.525 align:middle line:90%
like Alzheimer's or dementia.

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we find in
dementia and Alzheimer's is you

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.660 align:middle line:84%
start losing the
closest memory field.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But you still have access
to three, four, five, six,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and seven.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
happens if you exit life

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
is that you start
losing dimensionality.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
You start losing presence
in this universe.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we notice
it, like when I work

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
on people that are near death.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
We start seeing that they're
no longer totally here.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They assume some
form of translucence

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that shows that they're
becoming an energy being again.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's worked on people
that are dying will know this.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:90%
They have seen it.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But look at it as
you've started to lose

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
your dimensionality
presence in this universe,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that you've gone from
20 as a new child

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:90%
in this universe or 21.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Now you're down to 15.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you get really
sick or you become ill.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
You start losing
dimensional presence.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you go down to 10.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:84%
At 10, you start not being able
to interact with this world

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:90%
very effectively.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:90%
We call it old age.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying, oh, old
age is somewhere 50 years old,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
60 years old, 70 years old,
it becomes something of a,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:90%
I have lost reality.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm down to 10 dimensions.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I've
noticed is as people are dying,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
they start going
down to 10 to 9 to 8.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And finally they get down
to five, four, three.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Five, four, three is important.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Almost every
society in the world

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
has some form of, give yourself
three days before they cremate

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:90%
you or before they bury you.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the old explanations,

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:90%
it is very simple.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to give you time
to get out of your body,

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:90%
to be completely done with it.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:10%
What is also interesting when I
look at people who have already

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:10%
died is some of them are still
in more than one dimension.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now we get into the whole
concept of what ghosts are

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
or entities or non-physical
spiritual beings.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:10%
All of this comes
into play but can

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:10%
be described as the number
and level of dimensions

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:10%
of that existence.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the important
things I've found

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is that some people
actually don't

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:90%
stay in number-one reality.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:90%
They actually go to zero.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Their light goes
out of the universe.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It is reabsorbed into
the entire matrix

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of the energetic universe.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
This is what it means to
get off the wheel of life.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
You can experience life, but
you cannot experience death.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
total end of life.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And it is not possible.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It would be in violation of
the laws of the universe.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
All of the practices
and knowledge

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of Chinese energetic
medicine came

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
from the study of martial arts.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Kung fu is everything.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Kung fu is where the people had
a place, a temple, that they

00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
could spend their time trying
to develop information that

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
was beneficial to their own
people, their own students,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.775 align:middle line:90%
and to the population at large.

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And people would
go to these places.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
These were the
original hospitals.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And there are facilities
engaged in herbal treatments,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:10%
food treatments, exercises,
and, most particularly,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:10%
Chinese energetic medicine.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:84%
If you study martial arts,
specifically kung fu,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
in the first six
years, everybody

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
knows from the TV and
the shows that you

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
get to see all these
physical moves.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
But what happens after six
years of physical study?

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:84%
You're generally initiated
into the energetic side of it,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:90%
the zero side of kung fu.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The zero side of kung fu
is energy, the ability

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.345 align:middle line:90%
to move energy.

00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've noticed
in Wing Chun, a martial art,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is that Wing Chun deals
with push and pull.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I really think this
is an accurate way

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:90%
to look at the universe.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Were you pushed into existence?

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Or were you pulled
into existence?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Your potentiality and
existence independent

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of a physical reality
exists somewhere.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It exists in some dimensionality
that's probably not explained

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.085 align:middle line:84%
as quantum space, sub-quantum
space, or dark energy or dark

00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:44.885 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:18:44.885 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is a joke
in physics that

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
says, if you give a physics
professor a miracle--

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
the big bang-- he
will run with it.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we see.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
They start with a
big bang and say out

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
of nothing came everything.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.615 align:middle line:84%
But at some level,
that's a miracle.

00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how about being born?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:90%
How do we explain that?

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But there is also a
scientific event that occurs,

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
something that can be
observed, and something

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:90%
that can be explored.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is, at
the moment of conception,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:90%
there is an explosion of light.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It is the event that
represents an opening

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
in the fabric of the
universe through which all

00:19:53.430 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the information can come
that results in you.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So then the question becomes,
are you pushed into this life?

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Are you pushed
into physical form?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Or are you pulled in it by
the needs of the universe?

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't explain
why we ended up alive.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We can attribute
it to consequences.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:84%
We can attribute
it to, I did this.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:90%
You did that.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
You are not incarnate
because your parents had sex.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.738 align:middle line:84%
You are incarnate because
their parents and their parents

00:20:30.738 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and their parents
and their parents--

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
how far back can you go?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to eliminate causality
as a source of your existence.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It has to come from
an existential point.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It has to come from totally
outside of the known

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
thing large enough

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
that can answer that question.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
When I say, have
no fear of death,

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I can state that
because I've been there.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I have had people ask
me, what is death like?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:90%
You become undifferentiated.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
There is no independent
existence of the universe.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are
it, and it is you.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:90%
You are the ocean.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You are an individual
drop of the ocean.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And then you become the ocean.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you become an
individual drop again.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the only memories I have
is that at a particular point,

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I became the ocean,
became the universe

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:90%
during a time of death.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
To me, that lasted one
moment in my own existence.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But in regular time, number-one
reality, about 21 hours

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:84%
had gone by from
when I had died.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:10%
And I recovered
because of the efforts

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:10%
of the medical
profession and doctors.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84%
But I was still involved in
the entire universe for that 21

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:90%
hours.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It was like a pixilated
ball of energy.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But it only became a
pixilated ball of energy

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
as I was coming out of it, as
I became the observer of it.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, at the
point of observation,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I immediately emerged
back into consciousness.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I came back alive.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So being alive is to
observe you're alive.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It is to observe separation.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the original meaning
of abandonment and separation

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:90%
at birth.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But it comes from
the abandonment

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of the entire universe to
be born into a human form.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:84%
When you are born,
you have no concept

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of the extensive information
and opportunities

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and potentialities of the entire
universe as they exist for you.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the same
way, when you die,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:84%
you have no ideal of
what language to use

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
or how to relate the
experiences to somebody

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:90%
who has not done that.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say
it is subjective.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:90%
All death is subjective.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It is independently associated
with you, with your existence,

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
with your memories, with
your reference sets,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:90%
with your preference sets.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of this becomes
something to explore.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can only do
it by being alive.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Have no fear of death.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It is truly the highest state of
illumination and enlightenment.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, you
should not seek out death.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
But illumination
and enlightenment

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:90%
are certainly within bounds.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining me today.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I hope I was able to help you
understand the meaning of death

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
as a means for
transformation and that this

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is part of the energetic process
that leads to transcendence.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You are part of the energetic
processes of the universe.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
understand that,

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
the closer you are
to understanding

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:90%
your reality and all reality.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for an
all-new episode.
