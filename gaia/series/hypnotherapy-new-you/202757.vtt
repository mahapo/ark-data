00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Increase in Exercise Mind Talk

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.800 align:middle line:90%
audio.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an
emergency your subconscious

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
mind will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do, apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.975 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't matter at all,
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.855 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
This is your time and
you make the most of it.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.474 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.324 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:14.005 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Gentle breaths in and out.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.255 align:middle line:84%
Returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful,
tropical beach.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
where you are, as long

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:90%
as it feels good to you.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.855 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze
gently blowing over you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.945 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.275 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out,
as they relax and you

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.575 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and down into your hips and your
thighs, over to your right leg.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
The light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up
and down from the top

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
of the hips to the
tips of your toes,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.255 align:middle line:84%
as the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:90%
into your life leg.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:21.040 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed but you

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.145 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.455 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:90%
so colorful and vibrant.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can smell the rich
aroma of these flowers,

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at east and so calm.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.185 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you,

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
knowing deep within
yourself you're

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
going to a very special
place, a place where

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create some
positive, wonderful, long

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.625 align:middle line:90%
lasting changes.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.255 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance and
you can see a wooden bridge

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.615 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.605 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
10, 9, deeper and
deeper still, 8, 7.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:44.820 align:middle line:84%
All the way down
to relaxation now,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, and 4, drifting off
peacefully and easily,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
3, 2, all the way down,
deeply relaxed, and 1.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable,
padded chair

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
You know that working
out is important

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
because you know how
exercise is good for you.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, it
seems as though a part of you

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.940 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to work out.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't really
see yourself as motivated,

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you're waiting for the
right time to start exercising.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Exercising regularly
may seem challenging.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But imagine how you
would feel if you

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
had the drive and
the determination

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to exercise consistently.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Hypnotherapy is your
key to opening the door

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to your subconscious and
to changing your thinking

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.830 align:middle line:84%
patterns, fueling your
passion and drive to exercise

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and desire to make exercise
a part of your life.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do to
start making those changes

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is sit back, close your
eyes and get comfortable.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Focus inwards and let your
mind accept the new thinking

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
patterns of drive
and motivation.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You realize that in order
to increase your stamina,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
you will need to be in the
right frame of mind, which

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so important to
you that your mental outlook is

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:90%
much improved.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You also know that the food
you eat is so important,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
so your body is
fueled for exercise.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
You begin eating
small and frequent

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
healthy, nutritious
meals, and you

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
eat slowly and deliberately,
allowing your body

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to digest and enjoy
each mouthful.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.625 align:middle line:84%
And when you've had enough to
eat, you simply stop eating.

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's as easy, as simple as
that when you've got your mind

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
set in the right state.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You also fill your mind with
positive thoughts and feelings,

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
removing as much negativity
from your life as you can.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
And from now on,
try and surround

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.690 align:middle line:84%
yourself with things
that inspire you and make

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
you feel good, that
make you feel like you

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:90%
want to get up and move.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You start to enjoy the
feeling in your body

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
as you create more movement,
even if it's fast walking.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to reignite
and rediscover your love

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and passion for exercise.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that you're
in a beautiful garden.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And you may notice
how there are trees

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and how colorful they are,
beautiful, colorful flowers,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.595 align:middle line:90%
and how the skies are clear.

00:17:54.595 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Take a look down at the grass
and see how beautiful and lush

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:90%
it looks.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:11.245 align:middle line:84%
You take a lie down on
the soft, cushioned grass.

00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You feel the warm air
move down your body,

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the tips of your toes,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and really take in the power
of that relaxation now.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You realize that when you
exercise, you feel good.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You are energized and you
feel a rush of endorphins.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.765 align:middle line:84%
You feel strong
and full of energy.

00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Exercise will make you
not only feel great,

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
but it will help you
to look even better.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Your body will start
to change and you're

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:90%
excited about those changes.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
You know that you feel
stronger on the inside

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and your body reflects that
too, with strength and tone

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:90%
and muscle.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to
get that feeling back.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy that rush and
glow after a workout session.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Being fit and healthy
makes you feel great,

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to push
yourself to meet your goals.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to start
exercising as much as possible

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%
within your time restrictions.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And from now on you make
sure that you find that time.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You find the time to
put yourself first,

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
to put your health first.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.695 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You know that it
makes you healthy

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're now motivated to
reach your full potential.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And you remember the
importance in warm up exercises

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
before pushing your
body to extreme,

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.685 align:middle line:90%
and you always adhere to this.

00:20:22.685 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't
exercised for a while,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
you make sure that you build
up your routine gradually,

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.835 align:middle line:84%
adding more time and more energy
at subsequent workout sessions.

00:20:40.835 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
this is the only way

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to succeed while taking care
of your body and your mind.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And if at times you find
it hard to keep going,

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
you recognize how worthwhile
this is going to be

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're not afraid
to push yourself just

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
a little bit further,
always a little bit further,

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
stopping when it's time
to stop, but pushing

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
if you feel it's right and
if you have it within you.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
You are a capable,
strong person,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:90%
capable of exercising regularly.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
You're motivated to be organized
enough to make the time

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:90%
to complete a workout regime.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself now waking
up, or at a time of day that's

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:84%
suitable for you, and visualize
yourself now getting changed

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:90%
into your workout clothes.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You feel excited about
the session you're

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.805 align:middle line:90%
about to embrace and complete.

00:22:05.805 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself during
your exercise session

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're proud of what
you're achieving, working

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:84%
towards your goals,
giving yourself

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
more energy, more endorphins,
and that feeling of achievement

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
that you love.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now in
your workout session,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.730 align:middle line:84%
the changes in your body,
that feeling afterwards,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.990 align:middle line:84%
the pride, the fulfillment,
the glow, the endorphins.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to
do that once again.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to
start a routine,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it's three times
a week or even more.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you make
sure you find time

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.515 align:middle line:90%
to put yourself first.

00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Project that into an image.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Project the feelings of
pride, the wonderful sense

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
of accomplishment,
attainment and achievement.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that you have
achieved this by yourself

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with your own determination.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You're excited thinking
about your workout

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and you can't wait
to get going with it.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Whether you exercise on
your own or with friends,

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're becoming
more and more healthy,

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:84%
giving yourself more energy,
changing your body shape,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and meeting those goals.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.365 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to sit,
to be stagnant, to feel lazy.

00:23:57.365 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you're driven
by movement, strengthening

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
of your muscles, your body,
and your overall fitness

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.322 align:middle line:84%
These are now within
your top priorities.

00:24:14.322 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
You're passionate about
making the most of your time

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and you want to use it to
the best of your ability,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and you know how
exercise makes you happy

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and you keep doing it.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.760 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that you always
find a way to exercise,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
whether you're at home or away,
whether there's a gym or just

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.860 align:middle line:90%
a simple room.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You know that there's
a way to exercise.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And from now on,
you make no excuses,

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:84%
for that motivation and
determination is too strong

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
can use your own body

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
weight to do some
fantastic exercises

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.240 align:middle line:90%
with some significant results.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you start to mix
up what type of exercise

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You start to vary it,
so you focus on sports

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that suits you,
whether it's yoga or weights

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:90%
or running or going to the gym.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You find something that
suits you and your body.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Once you find that form of
exercise that you enjoy,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:90%
you stick with it.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And then you mix it up.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:90%
You vary it.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.864 align:middle line:90%
Find something else.

00:25:54.864 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:84%
You know that those
muscles in your body

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
need to be shocked into a
different form of exercise

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
so you vary your exercise and
those muscles are strengthened

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:90%
in all kinds of different ways.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy the
feeling of being

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
able to do these different
exercises and the pride

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.815 align:middle line:84%
that you get after
your workout session.

00:26:20.815 --> 00:26:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You're determined now
to turn your life around

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and to start looking
after yourself,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.695 align:middle line:84%
treating your body with the
love and respect it deserves.

00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.960 align:middle line:84%
You surround yourself with
as many positive people

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
as you can, people who
inspire you and want you

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:90%
to be the best that you can be.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you find
yourself drawn

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to uplifting music, music that
inspires you and pushes you.

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Have a think now about
what aspects of your life

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:84%
you may want to
work on and change,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the people
you surround yourself with,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
the food you're
fueling your body with,

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:84%
the music you're listening to,
the time of day you wake up,

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.075 align:middle line:90%
your goals, your mental outlook.

00:27:32.075 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
you can change

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.075 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to
make that change now.

00:27:41.075 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And each area that you
identify that needs to change

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.930 align:middle line:84%
brings you a wonderful
feeling of quiet anticipation.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And these feelings help you
to feel even more comfortable,

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
even more relaxed
and happier than you

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:90%
have felt in a long, long time.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And from this moment
onwards, your determination

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and motivation to
increase your stamina

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.560 align:middle line:84%
grows stronger and stronger,
stronger by the day,

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.275 align:middle line:84%
stronger by the hour, and
stronger by the minute.

00:28:28.275 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:00.270 align:middle line:84%
alert and feeling fantastic,
bringing back with you

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
all of the wonderful
new feelings.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:90%
