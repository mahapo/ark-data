00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
smoking hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:90%
will alert you.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.458 align:middle line:84%
And you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Lie back and let go, and enjoy
all those peaceful feelings

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.135 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice.

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low, deep sigh

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Now in your
imagination, I'd like

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
you to imagine that
you're standing

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.850 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a hill
on a beautiful island.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely
warm summer's day.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear, blue
sky, not a cloud in sight.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.087 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the gentle
warmth of the sun on your head

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and shoulders.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
the sounds of nature

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.352 align:middle line:84%
all around you, making you
feel even more relaxed.

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The long grass in the
meadow below sways slightly.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can see a
winding path that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
disappears into a
small apple orchard

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
just at the bottom of hill.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And just beyond the
orchard, you can

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:84%
see the sea, the
sunlight darting off

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
the tops of the waves, the whole
ocean shimmering and sparkling.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You begin to move easily
down the path now,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
noticing the grass
springing under your feet,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:84%
pushing you encouragingly
towards your destination.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And you catch the faint smell
of sea air in the breeze

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
ocean as you stroll down,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
down the winding path, and
you move smoothly and easily.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.755 align:middle line:84%
And you feel relaxed and
centered and fully in control.

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.563 align:middle line:84%
You're becoming aware now of
the growing calm within you.

00:03:53.563 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You stop to look at the
beautiful flowers growing

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
each side of the path, their
colors so vivid and bright.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there for a
moment taking in the view.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of happiness flows
through you, continuing down.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
You're aware now of a deep sense
of calmness and tranquility

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
right from the top of your
head to the tips of your toes

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.428 align:middle line:84%
renewing your energy
and feeling wonderful.

00:04:36.428 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:84%
As you walk, you find yourself
almost floating as though

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.765 align:middle line:84%
in a dream world down
towards the object.

00:04:45.765 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You move with such ease
with no effort whatsoever.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And in no time,
you find yourself

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
drifting through
the fruit trees with

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the lush, cool, green foliage
forming a canopy overhead.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.435 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
sunlight glittering

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:90%
through the branches.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there, you
feel a glittering sunlight

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.805 align:middle line:90%
on your face and neck.

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And you feel and
experience it vibrating

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.255 align:middle line:84%
throughout your entire
body-mind system.

00:05:26.255 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And as the sunlight moves, it
glows and warms and soothes

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:90%
and heals your body and mind.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And you release and relax
and move down and down,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
taking in another deep breath,
relaxing even more now.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
sound of the ocean

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
as you move nearer and nearer.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And with every
step you take, you

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
feel more relaxed
and more calm as you

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
follow that winding path
that leads you downward.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:90%
You turn a corner.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And to your delight,
you find yourself

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
on a beautiful deserted
beach, the beach sweeping away

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
into a small bay
in front of you.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And the ocean is a striking
turquoise blue, pure and clear.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the warm
sand underneath your shoes.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:90%
And you take your shoes off.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And you start walking
lazily across the beach

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:90%
to the water's edge.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
You feel the sand
beneath your feet.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the
sand change from cool

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to moist beneath your feet as
you wander along the shoreline.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
As you turn around,
you start to walk up

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the beach towards
a grassy mound.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk up slowly, you
take in the smell of the ocean.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the
sound of the water

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.685 align:middle line:90%
hissing over the warm sand.

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You reach the mound
now and you sit down,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.033 align:middle line:90%
making yourself comfortable.

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And as you gaze out across
the breathtaking scene,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
you watch the waves roll
in and roll out again,

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically in and out again.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
You play with the sand
through your fingers,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.990 align:middle line:84%
noticing just how good you
feel, so relaxed now, so

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that you've opened
up your subconscious mind.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready to start
making those changes you've

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.050 align:middle line:84%
been wanting to make
once and for all.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And now that you're in
a deeply relaxed state,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
we're going to focus
on smoking, a habit

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.329 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps you have been
doing for years and years.

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a new
habit or an old habit,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the good news is that
habits can be broken

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:90%
as easily as they're created.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways to do that is

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.910 align:middle line:84%
to make you aware
of your smoking.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
From the very moment you
reach for a cigarette,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll be extremely conscious
of what you're doing.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
If you light it
and start to smoke,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
you'll be unusually
aware of every moment

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
of the time you're involved
in smoking that cigarette.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the main
reasons you continue to smoke

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
is because you're
doing it unconsciously.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've not really been
aware of what you were doing.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But from today,
you are extremely

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:90%
conscious of what you're doing.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Each time you reach
for a cigarette,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.940 align:middle line:84%
your attention will be
drawn to that cigarette

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and focus uncomfortably upon it.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you're aware
of what you're doing,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
you're no longer doing
it subconsciously.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You have no desire
to continue smoking.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be
easy and effortless for you.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There will be none
of the struggle

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and fight with
willpower you may have

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:84%
experienced in the past, no
guilt of smoking as you do it.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Your newfound
awareness will make

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
you annoyed with smoking,
disgusted and bored by it.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It won't taste as
good as it used to.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:90%
You simply don't want to.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:90%
You just don't want to continue.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
You already made up your mind.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:90%
You found the reason you smoke.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a habit.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've already made up
your mind a final decision

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:90%
to stop smoking altogether.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Time to break that habit now.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
You've already made up your
mind to stop smoking altogether.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You've made up your mind that
you're going to stop now,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:90%
not tomorrow, not the next day.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But you're stopping
this very moment.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
You've made a final
decision to stop smoking.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just a decision.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.670 align:middle line:84%
You genuinely want to stop
smoking as of this very minute.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
You know why you want to.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And think about that
reason for a moment.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.837 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.837 --> 00:11:40.045 align:middle line:90%
Form it clearly in your mind.

00:11:40.045 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
problems smoking causes

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
whether it's financial
burden, health issues,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:90%
or for your family.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You have no need to
smoke because of that.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
You're giving it up now.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:90%
You're giving up coughing.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You're giving up pain.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:90%
You're giving up trouble.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.365 align:middle line:84%
You're giving up all the
things you don't want.

00:12:14.365 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You're giving up the things
you don't want in order

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to get the things you
do want in your life--

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
relaxation, better health,
to smell better, to respect

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and no longer want to fill
your body with toxins.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And this gives you a feeling
of security, happiness,

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:90%
and control.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You forget about cigarettes
all together now.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:90%
You are now a nonsmoker.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
You have no need to buy
cigarettes because you

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:90%
have no need to smoke them.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And should you perhaps
accept a cigarette,

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:90%
you will immediately stop.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll immediately
be aware of it.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be overcome with
an uncontrollable compulsion

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to break it in two as soon
as it enters your hand.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you touch
the cigarette,

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
you'll instantly
break it in two.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
It will remind you of all
the bad things that you're

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
giving up and all
the good things that

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
are in store for you.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You realize how much
greater the proportion

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of goods you're receiving is
than the portion of bad you're

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:90%
giving up.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:06.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
It will seem a
small thing to you

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
now to give up
smoking considering

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
the tremendous benefits you'll
be receiving for giving it up.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to give up
things you don't like.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you
do not like to smoke.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
You are now a nonsmoker.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You now replace your
habit of cutting

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
a cigarette to your mouth
with getting a glass of water

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and putting that to your
mouth and taking a sip.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have a
desire to put a cigarette

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
into your mouth, you
simply replace it

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
with having a sip
of a glass of water.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you like to do
something with your hands,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:84%
then maybe hold a pen or
a fidget toy or anything

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.345 align:middle line:84%
to keep your hands
busy and occupied.

00:14:58.345 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
The cigarette feels
uncomfortable in your hands

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It feels wrong,
uneasy, like you're

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
holding a stick full of toxic
chemicals, toxic chemicals

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that you would never
want to put in your body.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You begin to feel
proud of yourself,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.210 align:middle line:84%
proud as you are
now a nonsmoker.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.805 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you now find it
easier to conquer other habits.

00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
It makes it easier for you
to conquer life in general.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It fills your ego, making
you more self-confident,

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
more self-assured,
and more self-reliant.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You keep a record in the
beginning of your progress.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Every single day,
you remind yourself

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of how successful you've
been as an abstainer,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
how many days, how many
weeks and months you've

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
been an abstainer and how
wonderful it's made you feel.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:90%
You are now a nonsmoker.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You continue to
keep this record.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And it will encourage
you and fortify you

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
as a tangible record
of your success.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Soon, you will no
longer feel the need

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to keep such a record
because you know that you're

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
an abstainer permanently,
that this record will

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
go unblemished for the
rest of your life now.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
You already know that
no habit is stronger

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
than the power of
your mind which

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
created it in the first place.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:90%
It's now you versus tobacco.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And you will easily win
for you are stronger.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
You have patience,
great patience now,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:90%
great perseverance.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And you have a huge amount
of determination, huge amount

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of resilience.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:90%
And you will break this habit.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And all the time feeling
calm and relaxed.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can shake it.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
You go on patiently day to day.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And every day will be a success.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And you become
accustomed to success.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And soon, that
feeling of success

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
will be far more
important to you

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
than any habit
could possibly be.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:90%
You are now a nonsmoker.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy being a
nonsmoker more and more each

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
and every day.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.940 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And they'll become
more and more powerful

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, feeling confident

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
knowing that
whatever happens, you

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
have the resources that
they need to cope and manage

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:90%
any situation.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Bringing back with you now the
wonderful new feelings, 1, 2,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:90%
3, 4, and 5.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:90%
