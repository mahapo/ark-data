[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Alcohol and Moderation Mind

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Talk Audio.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
you are in a safe
and comfortable place

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and
let go, and really enjoy

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:84%
these peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
In this deep and special
sleep, your subconscious mind

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
for your safe keeping
monitors everything

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that's happening around you.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So these suggestions, because
they're for your benefit,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.258 align:middle line:84%
go directly to your subconscious
mind where they're accepted.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And these thoughts
become established,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
firmly fixed deeply in
your inner mind, embedded.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So these suggestions
remain with you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
long after you open
your eyes, helping

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you to change those
things you want

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:90%
to change for your own sake.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And these new thoughts
help you begin

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to change the things
you want to change,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and these changes allow you to
enjoy your life more and more.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
imagine that you're

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
checking your body to ensure
you become totally relaxed.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
As your muscles relax, just
let your mind relax also,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
beginning with your feet.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Feel your toes.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Stretch them and feel
the texture of what

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:90%
your feet are resting on.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And now begin to
tighten your calves,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:90%
and allow them to relax now.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Allow that relaxation to
spread past your ankles,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
up your calves through
the back of your knees,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and feel those muscles
easing, resting comfortably.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the large muscles
of your thighs.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Pull them tight.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.195 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of those
large muscles tensing.

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:51.146 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.146 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:90%
And now relax those muscles.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Feel them lengthen and
resting comfortably.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Feel your legs as they sink even
deeper as you relax even more,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.665 align:middle line:84%
and notice how rhythmic
your breathing is becoming.

00:04:18.665 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Now your stomach muscles.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.515 align:middle line:90%
Pull them together gently.

00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And now let them expand
and relax comfortably.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders and
the back muscles--

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:90%
flex your shoulders.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
pull across your back.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And now let your shoulders
slap as you relax the muscles.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And notice how your spine
sinks deeper into your chair

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.115 align:middle line:90%
as you relax even more deeply.

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.535 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy and regular
your breathing has become.

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Now your fingertips and fingers.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Clench them now.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.625 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:32.746 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And now allow them to relax.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation to spread
up your arms all the way up

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to your neck, and
make sure your neck is

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with your
head in an easy position.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Tighten up your neck muscles.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now let those columns
of muscles loosen

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
as the muscles relax
and you allow your neck

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
to sink into the cushions
into a comfortable position.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Your facial muscles are
flat and stretch comfortably

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:90%
across your face.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze up your face.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Feel the tension.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And now relax those
muscles and feel

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:46.410 align:middle line:84%
the lengthening and softening,
relaxing more than ever before.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You can now feel the air
temperature against your skin,

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and it feels smooth
and comfortable.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow the relaxation

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to spread onto your
scalp, knowing that you're

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
relaxed throughout your body
from the top of your head

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.495 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:07:19.495 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:32.175 align:middle line:84%
Your body is now loose and
limp and heavy and relaxed.

00:07:32.175 --> 00:07:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Notice how your body
is sinking deeper

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation
as your breathing

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
becomes more regular and easy.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'll
count slowly from 1 to 10.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And with each number, you
drift deeper and deeper

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.120 align:middle line:90%
into peaceful relaxation.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, and 10.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Now feeling deeply relaxed.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And you find it easy to
focus your attention,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.545 align:middle line:84%
and you imagine
things very clearly.

00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
standing on a balcony which
has steps leading down

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:57.585 align:middle line:90%
to a beautiful garden.

00:08:57.585 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
into that garden,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:84%
you see it surrounded
with lovely trees,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.600 align:middle line:84%
ensuring the garden is private,
secluded, and peaceful.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
There are flower beds
set in the lovely lawn,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and further along is a
waterfall flowing into a stream.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
sound of the water.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:84%
As you look around
you, you see the trees,

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and you hear a faint sound
of a bird in the distance,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
adding to the feeling
of deep relaxation

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
through your entire being.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
If you look more
closely, you'll see

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
that there are five
steps leading down

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to the garden and
then a small path that

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:90%
leads to the waterfall.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment we'll walk down
the steps, and with each step

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.480 align:middle line:84%
you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
As you put your foot
on the first step,

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:84%
you feel yourself going
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Down onto the second step.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle line:84%
As you feel your foot
firmly placed onto the step,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
you feel wonderful relief
as you drift even deeper

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation now.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the third step,
feeling wonderfully free

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and so, so relaxed as your foot
reaches for the fourth step.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Another wave of relaxation
drifts through your whole body.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Down onto the fifth step
now, feeling even more deeply

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And now as you find yourself
standing on the lawn,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
you see a little way
ahead a waterfall,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.065 align:middle line:84%
and you listen to the water
as it gently splashes.

00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You can notice the birds singing
in the distance and the sound

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:90%
of the trees gently swaying.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And a little to the side is
a comfortable garden bench.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.147 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
color of the bench.

00:12:04.147 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'd like
you to walk over to the bench

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
and sit down on the bench.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you sit down,
and you're surprised

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:90%
at just how comfortable it is.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
even more relaxed.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
As you sit down on the bench,
you take a deep breath.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
feel a wave of relaxation

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
go through your
whole body, relaxing

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.740 align:middle line:90%
every muscle, every knot.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe in, you
breathe in positive thoughts.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you
breathe out negative thoughts,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
leaving room for more positive
thoughts on this journey ahead.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:84%
You know that
you've been feeling

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable about
the level of alcohol

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.325 align:middle line:90%
you've consumed recently.

00:13:15.325 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This means that you have already
decided on a conscious level

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's time to reduce
your alcohol consumption.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.165 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to
make that change.

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And now it's time to reinforce
this desire and your motivation

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to stick to your decision on
a conscious and subconscious

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:84%
level and reap the benefits
of the changes you're

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:90%
about to make.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You know that you don't have a
deep-rooted issue with alcohol.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.375 align:middle line:84%
You simply want to cut down
on the amount of alcohol

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.175 align:middle line:90%
you consume.

00:14:11.175 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you feel
that when you drink,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
you find it hard to stop
at a reasonable amount,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps you're
finding yourself drinking

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
far too frequently,
and you simply

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:90%
want to cut down on your intake.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know that drinking
alcohol excessively

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.985 align:middle line:90%
is toxic to your body.

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
It can cause problems with
your liver and your kidneys,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:90%
your stomach, and your heart.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You're drinking poison,
and you no longer

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
want to feel the guilt
that you're damaging

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:90%
your health in this way.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
You may also feel that
drinking alcohol excessively

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
may have been affecting
your normal, everyday life.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's been affecting your
social and work relationships

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of
life in general.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the first
thing that alcohol impacts

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
is your brain.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.190 align:middle line:84%
You know that it impairs
your thinking and your sense

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
of judgment, and you're ready
to put this behind you now.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.800 align:middle line:84%
You know that drinking
alcohol excessively leaves you

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:90%
feeling terrible the next day.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Your head may be
feeling fuzzy, and you

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
may feel tired and short
tempered, nauseous,

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and desperate to
get through the day.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You know that this
isn't you at your best,

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're tired of
feeling this way.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
You know that once you've had
a drink, your state of mind

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:90%
is slightly altered.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And you have previously
chosen to continue drinking

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
instead of stopping
when the time is right,

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and this is going to change now.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine that
you're out on a social occasion

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:90%
and you've finished your drink.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Your glass is empty.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.355 align:middle line:84%
You go to the bar to
order another drink.

00:16:59.355 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But this time
instead of ordering

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
another alcoholic beverage,
you ask for a glass of water.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.190 align:middle line:84%
You start drinking the
cool, refreshing water,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and you enjoy the feeling.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy that cleansing feeling
as it flows down your throat.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
actually flushing out

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
those toxins from
your first drink.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
You feel the pride in
the fact that you're

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
taking care of
your body, and you

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
know that by drinking
a big glass of water,

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
you're benefiting from
the rejuvenating powers

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.250 align:middle line:84%
that water has on
your mind and body.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.874 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.874 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And once you've finished
your glass of water,

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
you may choose to order
another glass of alcohol,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
but this time you choose to
sip it slowly and carefully

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:90%
as the evening continues.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Once you finish that
glass, you once again

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.480 align:middle line:84%
order another glass of
water, and once again

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
you reap the benefits, knowing
that you're going to wake up

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
with a clear head, feeling
good about yourself,

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and much more ready to make
the most of the day ahead.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You relish in the thought that
the water will help your body

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:84%
to process the toxins
that you're consuming

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:90%
in your alcoholic drink.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And by drinking water in
between classes of alcohol,

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
you're not only
cleansing your body

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
but you're also going to remain
in control of your actions

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:90%
a lot longer.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
You may think about
drinking at times

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
when you're home and
not necessarily out

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:90%
on a social occasion.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But from now on, you limit this
drinking to certain situations,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:84%
perhaps if you're entertaining
guests or celebrating a very

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:90%
special event.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
You simply choose not to
have an alcoholic drink

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.535 align:middle line:90%
for any other reason.

00:19:47.535 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
are having guests

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or you're celebrating
a special occasion,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:84%
you may even find that you just
don't enjoy it in the same way.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You just don't need
it like you used to,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's fine because
you're much happier when

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
you're in complete control and
your thinking is unimpaired.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
If you do choose to drink,
you stick to drinking water

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
in between glasses, and you
drink your alcohol very slowly,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:84%
taking into account the
impact on your mind and body

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the things you want
to get done the next day.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're home and thinking
about having a drink,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
then you quickly pour yourself
a glass of something else,

00:20:55.230 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
perhaps something sweet
but definitely not alcohol.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And you get the benefits
of that treat, sweet drink

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:90%
but on your mind and body.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They are free from
toxic alcohol.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You prefer to spend your
money on other things,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and you prefer to spend your
time without the heavy head,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:84%
without the guilt,
and you take pride

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
in making the most of
each and every day.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you reduce
your alcohol intake,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that you're
rewarded in so many ways.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.045 align:middle line:90%
Your health may improve.

00:21:44.045 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.855 align:middle line:90%
You have more pride in yourself.

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
You find you're not
spending as much money.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you feel more
confident, more alert,

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and much more refreshed.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more focused,
and your body becomes stronger,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and your confidence
increases day by day.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Your old drinking
habits have been

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
replaced with newer,
more fulfilling ones,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited and
confident about being you

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:28.486 align:middle line:84%
without necessarily
needing a drink inside you.

00:22:28.486 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
You are valued and
your friendships

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:90%
do not depend on alcohol.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you'll be a much
more interesting person

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
now that you've
made this change,

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to get
going with this transformation.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.187 align:middle line:84%
From now on, alcohol has
lost its importance to you.

00:22:52.187 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
You can still enjoy
it, but you have

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
no interest in
overindulging, and you're

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
thrilled that you have made
this conscious and subconscious

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:90%
decision.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And these suggestions are firmly
embedded in your subconscious

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
mind, and they grow stronger
and stronger day by day.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.805 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind.

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five,

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and at the count of five,
you can open your eyes

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:84%
feeling fully refreshed, alert,
and feeling fantastic, bringing

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:84%
back with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now, so
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:90%
