00:00:13.776 --> 00:00:15.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-being.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the
resilience hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:10%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:10%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.088 align:middle line:10%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation,

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:10%
so please be sure that
wherever you are listening

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:10%
to this audio, you're in a
safe and comfortable place

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:10%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:10%
machinery.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:10%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.378 align:middle line:10%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:55.378 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:10%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:10%
you need to do apart
close your eyes,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:10%
relax, lie back,
and let go and enjoy

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.630 align:middle line:10%
all those peaceful feelings
and all the benefits that

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.430 align:middle line:10%
come with it.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:10%
In this deep and special
sleep, your subconscious mind,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:10%
for your safe keeping,
monitors everything

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
that's happening around you.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
So these suggestions, because
they're for your benefit,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.894 align:middle line:10%
go directly to your subconscious
mind where they're accepted

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:10%
and these thoughts
become established,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:10%
firmly fixed deeply
in your inner mind,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:10%
embedded so these suggestions
remain with you long after you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:10%
open your eyes, helping you to
change those things you want

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:10%
to change for your own sake.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:10%
And these new thoughts
help you begin to change

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.015 align:middle line:10%
the things you want to change.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And these changes allow you to
enjoy your life more and more.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:10%
And I want you now to
imagine that you're

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:10%
checking your body to ensure
you become totally relaxed.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:10%


00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.075 align:middle line:10%
As your muscles relax, just
let your mind relax also.

00:02:34.075 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Beginning with your
feet, feel your toes.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Stretch them and feel
the texture of what

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
your feet are resting on.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And now begin to
tighten your calves,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:90%
and allow them to relax now.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:10%
Allow that relaxation to
spread past your ankles,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:10%
up your calves to the
back of your knees

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:10%
and feel those muscles
easing, resting comfortably.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:10%
Now the large muscles of
your thighs, pull them tight.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.825 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of those
large muscles tensing.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Now relax those muscles.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:10%
Feel them lengthen and
resting comfortably.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Feel your legs as they sink even
deeper as you relax even more.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.325 align:middle line:84%
And notice how rhythmic
your breathing is becoming.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.185 align:middle line:84%
And now your stomach muscles,
pull them together gently.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And now let them expand
and relax comfortably.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders and back
muscles, flex your shoulders.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Feel those muscles
pull across your back.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.845 align:middle line:84%
And now let your shoulder
slouch as you relax the muscles.

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:10%
And notice how your spine
sinks deeper into your chair

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.755 align:middle line:10%
as you relax even more deeply.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.175 align:middle line:84%
And notice how easy and regular
your breathing has become.

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Now your fingertips and
fingers, clench them now.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Feel the tension, and
now allow them to relax.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Allow the relaxation to spread
up your arms all the way up

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:90%
to your neck.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:10%
And make sure your
neck is comfortable,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.275 align:middle line:10%
with your head in
an easy position.

00:05:46.275 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Tighten up your neck muscles.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:10%
Now let those columns
of muscles loosen

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:10%
as the muscles relax
and you allow your neck

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.885 align:middle line:10%
to sink into the cushions
into a comfortable position.

00:06:09.885 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Your facial muscles are flat
and stretched comfortably

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:90%
across your face.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.680 align:middle line:10%
Squeeze up your face.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:10%
Feel the tension.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:10%
And now relax those
muscles and feel

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:10%
the lengthening and softening,
relaxing more than ever before.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:10%
You can now feel the air
temperature against your skin,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:10%
and it feels smooth
and comfortable.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:10%
And now you can
allow the relaxation

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:10%
to spread onto your scalp,
knowing that you're relaxed

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:10%
throughout your body,
from the top of your head

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.115 align:middle line:10%
to the tips of your toes.

00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:10%
Your body is now loose, and
limp, and heavy, and relaxed.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:10%
Notice how your body
is sinking deeper

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:10%
into relaxation
as your breathing

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:10%
becomes more regular and easy.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And in a moment I'll
count slowly from 1 to 10.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And with each number, you
drift deeper and deeper

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:90%
into peaceful relaxation.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:28.456 align:middle line:10%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and
10, now feeling deeply relaxed.

00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And you find it easy to
focus your attention,

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.189 align:middle line:84%
and you imagine
things very clearly.

00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
imagine that you're

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.940 align:middle line:84%
standing on a balcony which
has steps leading down

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to a beautiful garden.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And as you look
into that garden,

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:10%
you see it surrounded
with lovely trees,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:10%
ensuring the garden is private,
secluded, and peaceful.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There are flower beds
set in the lovely lawn.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.955 align:middle line:84%
And further along is a
waterfall flowing into a stream.

00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You listen to the
sound of the water.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:10%
As you look around
you, you see the trees,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and you hear a faint sound
of a bird in the distance,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:10%
adding to the feeling
of deep relaxation

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.175 align:middle line:10%
through your entire being.

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:10%
If you look more
closely, you'll see

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:10%
that there are five steps
leading down to the garden,

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:10%
and then a small path that
leads to the waterfall.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, we'll
walk down the steps.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And with each step, you
go deeper and deeper

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:10%
So let's begin.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.990 align:middle line:10%
As you put your foot
on the first step,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:10%
you feel yourself going
deeper into relaxation.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:10%
Down onto the
second step, as you

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:10%
feel your foot firmly
placed onto the step,

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.520 align:middle line:10%
you feel a wonderful relief
as you drift even deeper

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:10%
into relaxation now.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:10%
Down onto the third step,
feeling wonderfully free

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:10%
and so, so relaxed.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:10%
As your foot reaches
for the fourth step,

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.745 align:middle line:10%
another wave of relaxation
drifts through your whole body.

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:10%


00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:10%
Down onto the fifth step
now, feeling even more deeply

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.375 align:middle line:10%
relaxed than ever before.

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:10%
And now as you find yourself
standing on the lawn,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:10%
you see a little way
ahead a waterfall.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And you listen to the water
as it gently splashes.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You can notice the birds singing
in the distance and the sound

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:90%
of the trees gently swaying.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And a little to the side is
a comfortable garden bench.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
You notice the
color of the bench.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'd like
you to walk over to the bench

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:90%
and sit down on the bench.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And now you sit down,
and you're surprised

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.675 align:middle line:90%
at just how comfortable it is.

00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
even more relaxed.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:10%
As you sit down on the bench,
you take a deep breath.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And as you breathe out, you
feel a wave of relaxation

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:10%
go through your
whole body, relaxing

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:10%
every muscle, every nerve.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe in, you
breathe in positive thoughts.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:10%
And as you breathe out, you
breathe out negative thoughts,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.785 align:middle line:10%
leaving room for more positive
thoughts on this journey ahead.

00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And now that you're in a
deep state of relaxation,

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to talk to
you about resilience.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps you define
resilience as the ability

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:10%
to recover from setbacks,
adapt well to change,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.980 align:middle line:10%
or keep going in the
face of adversity.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:10%
But really, it's just
your ability to keep calm

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.688 align:middle line:10%
and to carry on in the face
of any setbacks or difficulty.

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, you may
have had issues at work,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
or relationship problems,
or health struggles.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:10%
Whatever the setback
may be from now on in,

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:10%
you allow your subconscious
mind to process

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:10%
the initial emotions,
whether that's

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:10%
sadness, anger, or confusion.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you're
going to let it go.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
You no longer allow
those negative thoughts

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
to stay in your head
space for too long.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:10%
Doing that's called
mental agility,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and you now have the ability
to switch gears in your mind

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:10%
from reacting to stress
to responding to stress.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Reacting, after
all, is instinctive

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally driven.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Responding, however, it's a
much more objective approach,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
focus on that now.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer led
by your emotions.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you take a
step back and see things

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
much more rationally and
much more objectively.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you
may feel the need

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to talk through any problems
or, issues and that's

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
absolutely fine.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:10%
Picking up the phone to family,
or colleagues, or friends

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:10%
can help you to see things
from a new perspective.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:10%


00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:10%
You stop trying to solve
issues on your own,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:10%
and instead, you
reach out for help.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it's time
for you to do so,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you know that others will
provide that support to you.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:10%
You ensure that you have
the right work-life balance,

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:10%
finding hobbies outside of work,
a side hustle that fulfills you

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:10%
or simply nurtures
the relationship

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:10%
you have with others.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.176 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:10%
You know having a good
work-life balance helps

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:10%
you to build your resilience,
helping you to see that there's

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.684 align:middle line:10%
more to life outside any issues
or setbacks that are happening.

00:16:03.684 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:10%
You enjoy using
exercise as a tool

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:10%
to help you take the
stress out of your day.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:10%
Maybe that's going for
a long walk, or run,

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:10%
or taking an exercise
class, releasing energy,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:10%
letting go of tension,
and fueling your body

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:10%
with endorphins, helping you
to feel mentally stronger

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.908 align:middle line:10%
and capable to take on more.

00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.990 align:middle line:10%
You take care of your
health, taking regular breaks

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:10%
if you work, drinking
less caffeine and alcohol

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:10%
and eating much more mindfully.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that
you're only human.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:10%
You make mistakes
same as everyone else.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you encounter
difficulties,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.440 align:middle line:84%
if you ever feel upset or anger,
you know that's totally normal.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:10%
Beating yourself up for
overreacting or getting

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:10%
emotional only serve to add to
any burdens currently plaguing

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:10%
you.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:10%
So you allow yourself
to feel compassionate

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:10%
for the number one person
you need to worry about,

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:10%
which is you.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.812 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.812 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:10%
When you experience
problems or setbacks,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:10%
once you've taken the
time to reflect on them,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:10%
you take action.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
You think about what you
can do to help the matter,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
to rectify the problem,
or aid the situation.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is alight with
ideas, solutions, and thoughts

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
on how you can
improve the situation.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't dwell
on the negatives.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:90%
You focus on the solutions now.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:10%
You never ignore the setbacks
and obstacles for too long.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you take what
you've been given,

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and you truly learn
to develop resilience.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:10%
Slowly and steadily,
your resilience

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:10%
is getting stronger
and stronger each day.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:10%
You're more compassionate
and kinder to yourself.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:10%
You have the ability
to reflect more,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:10%
to think more about
your comeback plan

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:10%
if you need one, all the
time thinking rationally

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:10%
instead of emotionally,
becoming more and more resilient

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:10%
each and every day now.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:10%
You know success relies on
an individual's capacity

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:10%
to cope, and even
thrive, when faced

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:10%
with stress and adversity,
so you remain relaxed, calm,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:10%
and in control of all
situations at all times,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:10%
recognizing that if you
feel calm and relaxed,

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:10%
you deal with any issues in
a more rational manner, step

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:10%
by step, day by day because
everything is going to be OK.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:10%
You have faith in what you're
doing, feeling more and more

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:10%
in control each and every
day, becoming more and more

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.725 align:middle line:10%
resilient, hour by hour.

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:10%
You now have a huge
ability to bounce back

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:10%
when encountering
challenges that

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.105 align:middle line:10%
are an inevitable part of life.

00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:10%
You know with practice,
resilience can be learned,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:10%
and you're learning how
to be more resilient, more

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:10%
and more each day.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Resilience consists of a
cluster of factors, behaviors,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:90%
thoughts, actions, attitudes.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:10%
And what you need to bounce
back from immense stress

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:10%
is commitment,
control, and calmness,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and you now have these
three things in threefold--

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:10%
commitment, control,
and calmness.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:10%
You believe that it's best
to stay involved when there's

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:10%
a setback, so you're
showing commitment,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:10%
rather than to pull out.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:10%
And you keep trying to influence
the outcomes in which you

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:10%
are involved, so
you're taking control.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.170 align:middle line:10%


00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:10%
And rather than give up, you
remain rational and unemotional

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:10%
at all times, staying calm--

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:10%
commitment, control, and calm.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:10%
You treat problems as
a learning process,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:10%
developing the habit
of using challenges

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:10%
as opportunities to
acquire or master

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:10%
skills and build achievement.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
You avoid making a
drama out of a crisis.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:10%
You know stress and
change are part of life.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:10%
How you interpret and respond
to these events in your life

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:10%
has a big impact on how
stressful you find them,

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:10%
so you learn not to respond
in a negative fashion,

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:10%
becoming more and more
resilient each and every day.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:10%
And each day, you
celebrate your successes.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:10%


00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:10%
You take time at the end of the
day to review what went well,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:10%
and you congratulate yourself.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.240 align:middle line:10%
You train your mind
to look for successes

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.840 align:middle line:10%
rather than dwelling on
negativity and failure.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:10%
You take positive action.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:10%


00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:10%
Doing something in
the face of adversity

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:10%
brings you a sense of
control, even if it

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:10%
doesn't remove the difficulty.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:10%


00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:10%
You have a positive view
of yourself, developing

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:10%
your confidence daily and your
ability to solve problems,

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:10%
and trusting your instincts
helps to build resiliency.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:59.020 align:middle line:10%
And as you keep a
realistic perspective,

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.120 align:middle line:10%
you place challenging
or painful events

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:10%
in the broader context of
lifelong personal development.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:10%
Your optimism is growing day
by day now, no more absolutist

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:10%
thoughts.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Nothing is ever
wholly good or bad.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:10%
You're realistic, but
positive, in your thinking.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:10%
If we allow our thinking to
dictate how we view something,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:10%
it'll take over, and you
now make your thinking work

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:10%
for your own benefit, rather
than letting it override you

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:10%
with doubt or by seeing
only the bad side,

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.040 align:middle line:10%
becoming more and more
resilient each and every day.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:10%
As you become more
reflective, and in tune,

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:10%
and aware of what
triggers lead to stress,

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:10%
this provides you
with the opportunity

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:10%
to prepare and gather
resources so you

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:10%
you're better able
to bounce back,

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:10%
becoming more and more
resilient each and every day.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:10%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:10%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:10%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:10%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:10%
to awaken you.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:10%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:10%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:10%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:10%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:90%
