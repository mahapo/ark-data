00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.420 align:middle line:10%
In our New You Guided Meditation
and Hypnotherapy series,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:10%
you'll find seven audios to help
you not only become healthier

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and fitter, but also more
motivated and resilient,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:10%
transforming
yourself into who you

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
want to be, whether it's
new year or whatever it is,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:10%
a time where you want to
change into that new person.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:10%
All of our audios are slightly
different to just meditation

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.870 align:middle line:10%
alone because we use powerful
therapeutic tools, including

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:10%
cognitive behavioral therapy,
neurolinguistic therapy,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:10%
visualization, and, of
course, hypnotherapy.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:10%
It's that powerful combination
that makes our audio so hugely

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:10%
effective, and they help
you to make those changes

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:10%
to your unwanted beliefs,
behaviors, old habits,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:10%
or negative thinking patterns.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:10%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:10%
and that's a state that's
really familiar to you.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:10%
It's the stage of relaxation you
fall into just before you fall

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:10%
asleep and just as you wake up.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:10%
So it's a really
natural feeling,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.313 align:middle line:10%
and it's completely safe.

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
When you're in
that relaxed state,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
you're in a theta
brainwave state.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:10%
And that allows us to
bypass your conscious mind

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:10%
and instead talk directly
to your subconscious.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:10%
The reason we want to access
your subconscious mind

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:10%
is because that's where all
your permanent beliefs, habits,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:10%
and memories live.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
By talking directly to
your subconscious mind,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
we're then able to retrain,
reframe, and rewire your mind,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning we can help you to
eliminate any unwanted fears

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
or behaviors, phobias, negative
thinking patterns, or limiting

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:84%
beliefs with new positive,
empowering suggestions,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
resulting in powerful,
long-lasting changes.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you
listen to our audios

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
at least four times
so you can really

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
override the old
beliefs, compound

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the positive messaging, and
help your mind to create

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
new, positive neural pathways.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
You'll soon see the changes
in the way you think and feel

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:90%
about an issue.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
We suggest you
follow your instincts

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the audios as
often or as little as you want.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:10%
You can listen to our audios at
any time of the day or night,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.142 align:middle line:10%
but we suggest you
listen to the audios

00:02:11.142 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:10%
when you're not too
tired, because if you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:10%
fall into a deep sleep, then
your subconscious mind just

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:10%
isn't listening.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you get to
the end of an audio,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and you open your eyes
when I ask you to,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but you don't remember
a word I've said,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:90%
then that's absolutely fine.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:10%
Your subconscious mind has
been listening all along,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:10%
and it will have taken in
the positive messaging.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:10%
So please make sure you
listen to our audios

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:10%
when you're free from
any interruptions.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to
them when you're actively

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
doing something-- driving
or operating machinery.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:10%
If there is an
emergency, and you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:10%
need to come out of hypnosis
before we awaken you,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:10%
that's absolutely fine.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will alert you,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll easily
come out of hypnosis.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:10%
It'll be just like waking up
from a deep sleep or a nap.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:10%
So for now, please click
on any audio you want to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:10%
and find a comfortable
position where

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:10%
you can really relax and let
go, maybe on a bed or a chair.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And then close
your eyes to begin.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
