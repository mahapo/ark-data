00:00:12.688 --> 00:00:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to the
House of Well-Being.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the Healthy
Eating Hypnotherapy Audio.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.525 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis,

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
but right now
there's nothing you

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back, and let go, and
enjoy all the peaceful feelings

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:90%
and benefits that come with it.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take
in a very deep breath,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
slowly inhaling, filling
your lower and upper lungs,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done
that, I'd like you

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
once again to take in a deep
breath, filling your lungs.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release as you
exhale gently and powerfully.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal,

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
your normal breathing
pace, gentle

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
breaths in and out as
you normally would.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.695 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it as I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:90%
refer to it in turn.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.925 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension and those muscles

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And now as you allow those
muscles to relax and release,

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
every nerve, every
fiber in your hands,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
your wrists and fingers,
arms, allow that tension

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to flow away now, to
drain down, allowing

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:84%
the muscles to rest and release
and lengthen and loosen.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.169 align:middle line:84%
aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of the tension
to fade away now as you

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:90%
drift deeper into relaxation.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Muscles loosening
and lengthening.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Those muscles relax
and release now.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Legs feeling heavy as
you release completely.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower back muscles,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:84%
loosening and lengthening
as each muscle releases

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:90%
as you sink into relaxation.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles in
your neck and scalp, aware

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:90%
of the tension here.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
release that tension

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
as every muscle in
this part of your body

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more
relaxed so that you can feel

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
each and every muscle in
your body now loosened

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and lengthened as that
comfortable heaviness continues

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.705 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you float
and drift feeling

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:90%
so comfortable and calm.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:06:54.410 --> 00:07:00.805 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.105 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So one, your entire body
completely released now.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle, every
nerve, and every fiber

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
relaxed and at ease, your entire
body feeling completely relaxed

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and comfortably heavy now.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And two, your head
feeling so heavy now.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and you feel safe and secure.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're enjoying this
state of deep relaxation

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're now deeper
than you've ever been,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
so deeply relax that
every word I utter to you

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Mind alert but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
You now feel that the
time is right to focus

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.064 align:middle line:90%
on healthy eating.

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You want to fill your body
with important vitamins

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and minerals, fiber, and all
the goodness and nutrition

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:90%
that your body needs to thrive.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been put off
by the taste and texture

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of healthy foods in the
past, or perhaps you

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
enjoy eating healthily but
you slipped into bad habits.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:84%
All of that is
about to change now.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to change your
eating habits gradually

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and easily, trying one
new thing at a time.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And more and more, you'll
find yourself rejecting

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
the old, inferior junk or
processed food that you used

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:84%
to eat in favor of a
healthier selection,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
not by magic or miracles,
not because I say so

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.005 align:middle line:84%
but because you have already
decided you want this change.

00:09:42.005 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Your body has been crying
out for healthier foods,

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's finally got
through to your mind

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
You become much more interested
in healthy foods, the food that

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel good, energized,
motivated, and confident.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
You no longer crave
the foods that

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
make you feel
temporarily good as you

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:90%
know it's only short lived.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
You know you'll soon feel
lethargic, tired, and guilty,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's just not worth it.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Your body will soon start to
react to those unhealthy foods,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and you care more for
your body, so you only

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
want nutritious, fueling,
healthy food from now on.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.630 align:middle line:84%
You've decided now is the time
to change, and you stick to it.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, from now on when you
see food that's not healthy,

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you immediately
remember how awful

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:84%
you felt after you last
ate it, and you realize

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.222 align:middle line:90%
it's just not worth it anymore.

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You think about what
it's doing to your body,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:90%
and you no longer want it.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you are now repulsed
by those unhealthy foods.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine your
most tempting, unhealthy foods

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that you find hardest
to stop eating.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Picture it now in your
mind, whether it's

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
chocolate or fried food
or fast food of some kind,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
hold it in your mind.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like you to
imagine it's covered in mold.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It smells awful, and
there's green algae

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:90%
growing all over it.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You cut into it, and there are
bugs crawling out from inside,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and you're disgusted by it.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there are
little hairs growing in it

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and revoltingly have
green slime covering it.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Imagine it now in your mind the
look of it, the smell of it.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Try to see it in as
much detail as possible,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and note just how
revolted you are by it.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to
eat that item of food.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It disgusts you.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
go anywhere near it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:84%
From now on, when
you're tempted to eat

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
that item of unhealthy
food, you automatically

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
remember that image,
and you are repulsed.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you choose
a healthy option,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:84%
one that fuels your body with
goodness, power, and health,

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and you feel great
after eating it.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
You're making changes now, and
you feel proud and excited,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:90%
determined, and motivated.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
You become curious and
fascinated by healthy foods

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
In future when you
see different foods,

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
fresh foods, a myriad of colored
vegetables, crisp and clean,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
tossed green and mixed
salads sprinkled with herbs

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and marinated in wine
vinegar or lemon juice,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:84%
freshly ground black pepper,
and exotic fruit like mangoes,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:90%
kiwis, and papayas.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You become fascinated by the
thought of how they taste,

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and the only way to
satisfy that curiosity

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:84%
will be to actually taste that
lovely, healthy, nutritious

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Each time you may find
something different to taste.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one day you'll want
to eat a juicy, fresh orange.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Another day you
crave green broccoli

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
or all of those other good
foods that you previously

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't eat or
didn't eat enough of.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And once the thought
comes into your mind,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
you feel a strong desire to
discover for yourself just how

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
delicious that natural,
healthy food is.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And you'll soon
find yourself eating

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
many varieties of succulent
fruits and vegetables

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
and salads.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite menu
of combinations which

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
only you can experiment with.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And very soon you'll discover
what's your favorites are,

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be eating
them more and more.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
You will enjoy this
new way of eating,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're passionate
about it and the changes

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you notice in
yourself and your body

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
changes that you've made.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're making these
changes forever now.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You no longer crave unhealthy
foods, and if you're tempted,

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
then you make sure you always
have a healthy substitute

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.025 align:middle line:90%
to replace that craving.

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
You no longer buy chocolate
or biscuits or sweets.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
From now on if you
feel hungry, you

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
reach for fresh juice, some
nuts, or anything healthy.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.435 align:middle line:84%
You always have a
substitute to hand.

00:16:06.435 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
By replacing the junk
food and immediately

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
replacing it with
healthy food in this way,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:84%
you're retraining
your thinking patterns

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
to reject the unhealthy
food and instead crave

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
healthy and more
fulfilling food.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you fill
yourself up with goodness.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.815 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have room for
any unhealthy snacks or meals.

00:16:35.815 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You're replacing
bad habits for good.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to be making
such positive changes.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy that feeling of waking
up feeling far more refreshed

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and energized.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps your skin
becomes clearer

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and your thinking is sharper.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
You feel your body reacting
to the new, healthy you,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to see what
other changes are to come.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.300 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:90%
