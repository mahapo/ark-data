00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.035 align:middle line:84%
>> You are listening to the
Weight Loss Mind Talk audio.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:84%
In a moment the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.790 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen
to this Mind Talk

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
if you're driving or
operating machinery.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you will
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
relax, lie back and let
go, and really enjoy

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.735 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.619 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
take in a deep breath.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out,
you can relax deeper.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And a little deeper now.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle
walk around the garden

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And you walk towards
some beautiful flowers,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and as you get nearer you can
smell that beautiful fragrant

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
scent.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent
and they grow brighter

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Now taking in another
long deep breath.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich fragrant scent,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.025 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path,
stepping down easily

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
onto the wide steps beneath you
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
You relax more and more
with every step you take.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and it has golden sand, like
a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:44.340 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one
after the other, gentle rhythmic

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently
shines down on you,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.241 align:middle line:84%
with the warm sea gently
sweeping over you.

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:90%
behind you as you walk onwards.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing deeper and deeper
with every step you take.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the seas
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
you walk back up the beach and
there's a lovely deck chair

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:84%
waiting just for you on
the sand under an umbrella,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.535 align:middle line:84%
offering just the
right amount of shade.

00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat and
you relax deeply now.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath and take

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
You look out the
calming sea again

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the sky, a clear
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.352 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
with polished, ornate
banister running down

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep
rich carpet that

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.610 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.335 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:09:06.335 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.805 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to 1.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
9, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
8, more and more relaxed
now, sinking even further

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
7, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.315 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:10.315 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, even further into your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
4, allowing your mind and
body to fully relax as you

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.951 align:middle line:84%
sink further into
deep relaxation.

00:10:32.951 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:43.538 align:middle line:84%
3, comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:90%
w, almost at the bottom now.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:90%
There's one more step to go.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And 1, going deeper
and deeper down now

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
into hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
This is your time and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.235 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
the ordinary, everyday world

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
as you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:90%
deeply inside of you.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind
still fully alert and aware

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
but you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It may be that you've
recently been feeling

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.435 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable with your weight.

00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're able
to remember a time

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
when you were just
the ideal weight

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and shape for your height.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you've never
been that ideal weight.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter, because you

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
can imagine how it will
feel when you have lost

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
that extra weight
and how it will

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:84%
feel to be able to
move easily and freely

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.620 align:middle line:84%
without the burden of carrying
around all that extra weight.

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Being unable to wear all
the clothes that you know

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
would look so good
on a slimmer body.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.215 align:middle line:90%
Having much more energy.

00:13:26.215 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Being proud of your body.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.962 align:middle line:90%
Enjoying more confidence.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.775 align:middle line:90%
Having more control.

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.585 align:middle line:84%
Feeling pride over the
healthy foods you're eating.

00:13:46.585 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Enjoying the
exercise you're doing

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and not hiding away as you're
embarrassed of the body

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.650 align:middle line:90%
you have now.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You're tired of being
fearful every time you step

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
onto the scales and
watching how the pounds have

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:90%
been steadily creeping up.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready and excited
to make that change now.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to make
the change and to become

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.150 align:middle line:84%
the slimmer and
healthier version of you

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.325 align:middle line:90%
that you so desperately want.

00:14:36.325 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And because you have decided
that now is the time,

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.937 align:middle line:84%
you are determined to make
that change once and for all.

00:14:51.937 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're sick of
going back and forth.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
You're determined to
stick to your decision now

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and to see those exciting
changes take place.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You're realistic and you know
that actually weight loss

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:90%
can be easy.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
There are no
complicated rules here

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to lose that
excess weight, not immediately,

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
not in a week or two, but
over the next few months.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to make
that lifestyle change

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and it all begins now as
you relax deeper and deeper.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd like now to think
about when you first

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.305 align:middle line:84%
started losing control
over the portions

00:15:56.305 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
or amount of food or choice
of food that you were eating.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
As a result, you may have
become an emotional eater

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or an angry, destructive
eater, habitual or ignorant

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
over-eater.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't matter
which one you are.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work on undoing
all those unhealthy eating

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.192 align:middle line:84%
habits now and make that
change once and for all.

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
We all start off our lives
with normal thinking patterns

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
around food.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.035 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, your
thinking has changed.

00:16:49.035 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to have a
think about whether you're

00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:84%
eating to make yourself
happy, or is it boredom.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Think about how you went
from being normal about food

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.110 align:middle line:90%
to not being in control anymore.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to think about
why you want to lose weight.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
You know that losing
weight for someone else

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be enough
of motivation for you.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Losing weight for
someone to love you,

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
for people to like you is
completely the wrong reason

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and you won't see any
long-term results there.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
This decision must
be completely yours.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Losing weight permanently
and healthily will only

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
be possible if you're doing
it for the right reason.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.605 align:middle line:84%
The reason should be for
yourself, not for anyone else.

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:05.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.250 align:middle line:84%
You know that you need to
change your habit of thinking

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:16.630 align:middle line:84%
around food And once you change
your thinking around food,

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.015 align:middle line:84%
the actions around
food will change.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:84%
The action of overeating
or eating the wrong foods

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
will go forever.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
But first we need to change your
habit of thinking around food.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you've broken that habitual
thinking which your mind has

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
created, then you'll soon
see how your actions will in

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:90%
turn change too.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
You know that diet pills don't
change your thinking, which

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
is why the minute people
come off their diet

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
pills their thinking habits
of food, of eating too much,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
or eating junk food comes
straight back again,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they put the weight
straight back on again.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So we really need to change
your thinking around food now,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to
make that change.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to think about
when you were a little child

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and you were offered a slice
of cake, perhaps at a party.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
You may have taken a bite
and then run off to play

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps come back for
another bite, so easily

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
distracted, not in
a rush to finish

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
the cake, no worrying about
the cake disappearing.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We're all born with the
same thinking around food.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you
were this little child,

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:84%
you didn't worry
about food being

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
a rarity, about that slice
of cake being a naughty food,

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:90%
so you ran off and came back.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It was no big deal.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, food wasn't
the main focus your day.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Something happened in your
life and now your thinking

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
has changed and you've
reframed those foods,

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and now food has become
your main focus of your day.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
main problems here

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
is that the more you
resist certain foods,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.964 align:middle line:90%
the more you want them.

00:20:45.964 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And we really need to
change your thinking here.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
There will be no
more resisting foods.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
You almost want to be
indifferent to food,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:90%
to be disinterested.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer the
focus of your day.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:84%
You no longer tell yourself you
can't have that slice of cake,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
you can't have those
biscuits or chocolates.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you tell yourself
that you can have those foods.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
But you can have them
tomorrow or the day

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
after or later, just not now.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
By thinking in this
way, you're not

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
resisting foods and therefore
creating even bigger motivation

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%
to eat that food.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your
subconscious mind no longer

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
fights and resists
unhealthy foods,

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
as this will only increase
your motivation for it.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It will consume you.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your
brain will only

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
want healthy, nutritious,
and tasty food.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
interested in sugar

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and pesticides and colorings.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You only crave healthy, whole
foods that fuel your body.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
From now on, if you see a
cake or unhealthy treat,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you may feel like
you would love one

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
but you realize that you love
fitting into your clothes

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.540 align:middle line:90%
even more.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.725 align:middle line:84%
You choose yourself
as a priority.

00:22:36.725 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You know that you can have that
treat but you choose not to.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't overthink it.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
You simply tell
yourself you can have it

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and you can have it tomorrow
or later or next week.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But right now, you
choose a healthy option

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and you feel pride as you
eat that healthy alternative.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You feel satisfaction
and confidence

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
as you fit into your clothes
much more comfortably now.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And those feelings
of satisfaction

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:84%
grow stronger and
stronger as you

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:84%
start to see the
changes in your body.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you feel the
freedom of not always obsessing

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:90%
over food.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
You love your body, and you're
excited about eating better

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:84%
food, about looking better,
feeling and looking younger

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.714 align:middle line:90%
and having much more energy.

00:23:50.714 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want
that guilty feeling

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:84%
after you've eaten too much
or too much of the wrong food.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You're done with
that feeling now.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:84%
If you know that
you're going to be

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
craving something at
a certain time of day,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:84%
craving something sweet to
eat, and from now on you

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.310 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you have
a healthy alternative

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
ready to go, ready to
get rid of that craving.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You know that cutting
something out won't work

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and it will only make
it worse and motivate

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:90%
you to eat that food even more.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
going to yo-yo diet.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
No more rewarding yourself
for losing the weight

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:90%
with other foods.

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
No more rewarding yourself
with ice cream or chocolate

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.505 align:middle line:90%
if you lose a few pounds.

00:24:58.505 --> 00:25:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You're depriving
yourself of those foods

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and then punishing yourself
with bad foods again,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.835 align:middle line:84%
and you want this vicious
circle to end once and for all.

00:25:14.835 --> 00:25:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of portions and
you stop when you feel full.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to feel
so full that you feel sick.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You realize that
any happiness you

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
feel after eating those
foods is false happiness,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer want to
feel that false happiness

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.080 align:middle line:90%
and you stop this habit now.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You have respect and
love for your body,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.288 align:middle line:84%
and you no longer want to
hate it or punish it anymore.

00:25:57.288 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't push yourself to do
exercise that you don't enjoy,

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:90%
as this won't work long term.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you find something
you're interested in,

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that you fall in love with,
that you're passionate about,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that makes you happy.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And because you enjoy it,
you're much more interested

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in it and you're much
more likely to keep

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.072 align:middle line:84%
it going and seeing
results from doing it.

00:26:33.072 --> 00:26:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And your body is loving
the new healthier way

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
of eating and the movement
that it's experiencing.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
You're now going to
choose to eat healthily.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no forcing your body to
do what it doesn't want to do.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You remember that motivation
will increase if you

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:90%
deny yourself of something.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
enjoy healthy foods,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:15.920 align:middle line:84%
then you need to retrain your
taste buds, slowly but surely.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this in time.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.754 align:middle line:90%
And you're excited to do this.

00:27:21.754 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And you start by taking
a small bite of something

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:90%
new every day.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And after 10 days, you will
have changed your taste buds

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and you'll start to love the
new fresh, healthy flavors.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Your whole new way of
thinking is about choice,

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and you choose to
leave that biscuit.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
You choose to step away
from any foods that

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:90%
aren't considered healthy.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
You know you can have them
later but not right now.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself you
can have them later.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And by doing this,
there's no resistance.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not increasing
that motivation.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You're tricking your mind.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:84%
You're using your
mind's ability.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You choose different
items of food.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.710 align:middle line:90%
You choose to be slimmer.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You know that right now your
weight isn't making you happy.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
now is the time

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to work on reframing
of food here.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing to go
to the gym or choosing

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:90%
to go for a fast walk.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
works for your body,

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:90%
you're making these choices.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Choosing to eat healthily.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
No forcing your body to do
what it doesn't want to do.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You remember that if
you feel like you really

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:84%
do want a treat and no healthy
alternative is available,

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:84%
you know that you can
have the odd treat.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.880 align:middle line:84%
You ideally aim for
80% healthy foods,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and the other 20% is for you
to have a treat every now

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and then, but it's controlled
and you do not go overboard.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
To help you make these
changes, you no longer

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
keep these treats of
sugar in your home.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.593 align:middle line:90%
You get them out of sight.

00:29:40.593 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you
can see those foods,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:90%
you'll want them even more.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.682 align:middle line:84%
So you no longer keep
them in your home.

00:29:49.682 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And you know that sugar is
one of the most harmful toxins

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and is a poison for your body.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You know that fats
are safe, those

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.620 align:middle line:84%
good fats in the form of nuts
and avocados or oily fish,

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:90%
and you're not afraid of fat.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But sugar is something you very
much stay away from from now

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's no forcing
your body to do anything.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You're simply
making that choice.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:90%
You're choosing to be healthy.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing to
do a form of exercise

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that you love, whether it's
tennis or walking, yoga

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:46.345 align:middle line:84%
or Zumba, whatever it may be,
it's something that you love

00:30:46.345 --> 00:30:49.375 align:middle line:84%
and you can then
stick with it and it

00:30:49.375 --> 00:30:52.210 align:middle line:84%
will have some huge
results for you,

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:84%
along with your healthy
way of eating and new mind

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%
set towards exercise and food.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.448 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.448 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine that
you are slim, you're healthy.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
You are your ideal weight, your
ideal shape for your height,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and you look good.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:90%
You feel good.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:90%
This is your ideal self.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So take that image in your
mind of your ideal self

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and place it up there in
the top corner of your mind

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
to remind yourself over and over
again how good it will be when

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:90%
you've lost that excess weight.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Remind yourself of that
visual image of what it is you

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:84%
want to look like and you
see it over and over again

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
as a form of motivation,
slowly but surely

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and healthily
reaching your goal.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Your determination and
motivation has doubled now

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to start
this new healthy lifestyle.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to start making
those changes once and for all.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And the more you listen
to this Mind Talk,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
the more you're reframing those
thinking patterns around food

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and the more determined
and motivated you'll become

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:90%
to start making those changes.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.160 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:51.470 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:90%
