00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Mystic teachings of many
spiritual traditions

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:84%
teach that our soul
has the ability

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to be reborn or live again
and again in a new body.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:84%
These mystics view
the human body

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
as an extension, an appendage,
or organ of our soul.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And the soul clearly takes
precedence over the body.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Our divine spark,
the kernel of life,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
or soul drop or wave
that is our eternal self,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
weaves the human body
out of strands of DNA

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
as an earthly
transportation vehicle,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
as an energy and
information-gathering device,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and as a way to work out
karma, among other uses.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual adepts
have demonstrated

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that the body's abilities
can be amplified

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and life enhanced
by the acquisition

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
of psycho-spiritual
powers of the soul,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
including love,
compassion, respect,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and honesty, among others,
and make us more righteous,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
meaning holy or whole beings,
and thereby dramatically

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:90%
improve our earthly existence.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
As we explored previously
in the Robe of the Soul,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
for nearly 5,000
years, activation

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:84%
of these spiritual powers
in human transmutation,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
transcendence, or ascension
beyond the body into a higher

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
form has been symbolized by the
acquisition of a power cloak

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:90%
or a garment of light.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
This glowing and
glorious cloak was

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
transmittable from a spiritual
adept to an initiate.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Receiving it and
internalizing or embodying it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
along with its code
and programs or apps

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
made one godlike
and whole or holy.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
these powers "shi powers"

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and referred to them as the
perfect powers of the soul.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
There's our magic word,
perfect, arising once again.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:84%
These robes or cloaks and these
perfect powers of the soul

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
made the wearer mighty
ones or giants on Earth

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and also enabled
their ultimate goal,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
ascension to otherworldly
cosmic realms through portals

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:90%
and gateways.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, Gilgamesh,
Nimrod, Elijah, Jesus

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
are just a few who
acquired this robe

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and dressed lightly in it
during their ascension.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
As I noted, the robe of light
is a universal symbol for power.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It is a physical
object, but it's also

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.600 align:middle line:84%
a way of representing abstract
concepts and mystical abilities

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.350 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Also, this cloak made
the wearer radiant.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Depictions of the ancient
gods as radiant and shining

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.240 align:middle line:84%
in their robe of light stepping
through cosmic gateways

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
are widely found in
the ancient world.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see a
Sumerian cylinder seal

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
from 1000 BC depicting an
Anunnaki goddess whose body is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a circle of
stars, indicating her radiance

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and her light
body, or star body.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, attaining

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
this otherworldly
garment and its powers

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
in imitation of
the gods has been

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:90%
the goal of all of humanity.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was only attained by
a few and then mostly men.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But today, this goal is
now within reach as never

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:90%
before and for everyone.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
By embracing the soul
code of this robe

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and connecting the dots
within, miracles can happen,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and anything becomes possible.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:90%
But is the robe all we need?

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Or is there more to it
than just this cloak app?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
My research says that,
in fact, there is.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a whole
kit of ascension apps

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that we need to embody in order
to complete our ascension.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Identifying these tools or apps
is the subject of this episode.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:10%
You can follow through on this
by reading my free e-book,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:10%
"The Skingularity is Near-- The
Next Human, The Perfect Rainbow

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:10%
Light Body and the Technology
of Human Transcendence."

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
In this book, I offered my view
that the ethereal power cloaks

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of the gods and divine beings
symbolized inner abilities

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:84%
or apps that gave the wearer
the miraculous super powers

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:84%
of levitation, invisibility,
instant materialization

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
of wishes, and super
strength, among other powers.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And this cloak, as I said, was
part of a collection of apps.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So beginning with the oldest
human story, Inanna's descent

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
to the underworld,
let's take a look

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
at the other ascension
apps and the importance

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:90%
of acquiring them.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Seen here is a
statue of the goddess

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Inanna or Mari, the
queen of heaven.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:90%
It dates to 2300 BC.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Until 2014, this statue
was in the Aleppo Museum

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
in Aleppo, Syria.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the true priceless
jewels of the ancient world.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:84%
When civil war began in Syria,
this statue was shipped out

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and is now hidden in a
secret location known only

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to the specialists
who handled it

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
to protect it from destruction
by Islamic State terrorists.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:10%
This statue, called "The
Goddess with a Vase,"

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.200 align:middle line:10%
depicts the goddess wearing
an array of symbols, including

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.190 align:middle line:10%
the PALA, or miracle garment,
which is the robe of light.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are described
in the Sumerian poem,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
"The Descent of Inanna," which
is the oldest human story.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It tells the story
of Inanna's descent

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and then her ascension
to her sister's throne

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and how she gathered seven
power objects called me.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's the poem.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
My queen, she has gathered
together the seven me.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:90%
She has taken them in her hands.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And with the me
in her possession,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:90%
she has prepared herself.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
On her head, she
wears the Shugurra,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
the crown of the steppe.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Across her forehead,
her dark locks of hair

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:90%
are carefully arranged.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Around her neck, she wears
the small lapis beads.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
At her breast, she wears
the double strand of beads.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.302 align:middle line:84%
Her body is wrapped
in the royal robe.

00:06:21.302 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes are daubed with
the ointment, let him come.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Let him come.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And around her chest,
she wears the breastplate

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:90%
called come, man, come.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
On her wrist, she
wears the gold ring.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And in her hand, she carries the
lapis measuring rod and line.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
In this poem, Inanna travels
to the kur, the underworld,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:90%
through a series of seven gates.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:84%
At each gate, she removes
one power object, or symbol,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
from her body until she
stands naked before the throne

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of her sister, Ereshkigal.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Scholars consider this
story the great monomyth.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And like all myths, it's
susceptible to interpretation

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
on at least six levels, the
literal, the historical,

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:84%
the cosmological, the
symbolic-metaphorical,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the mythological-allegorical,
the anatomical,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and the anagogical.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Our primary interest is in
the anagogical interpretation.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Anagogy is a Greek
word meaning assent.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
An anagogical interpretation
is a mystical interpretation

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of a word or a passage
or a sacred text that

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
detects allusions to
heaven or the afterlife.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
relates to ascension.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
As the original ascension
story, Inanna's descent

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:84%
tells how she acquired the
seven power objects or symbols

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and how we can, too.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
They are part of
our mystic anatomy.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Activating them and
then taking them off

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:90%
enables our soul to take off.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Similar garments
are worn by Ishtar

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in this plaque in
the Louvre Museum,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:90%
also dating to around 2000 BC.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The word "me," used to describe
what I call these ascension

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
apps, is also found
in the Sumerian word

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:84%
melammu, which is generally
translated as radiance.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
One scholar, Dr.
Shawn Aster defines it

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
as the protective covering
or outer layer of a person

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
or rays emanating from a being.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
The key thing, notes Dr.
Aster, is this covering

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
is transmittable or
transferable, just

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:90%
like the other apps.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow veils of the goddess
Ishtar were sometimes garments

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes
portrayed as jewels.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow was
called her necklace,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of which she made the bridge
to heaven for the souls

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:90%
of her chosen ones.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Her rainbow necklace
had selective power.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
If Ishtar chose or willed,
neither man nor god

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:90%
could cross this rainbow bridge.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
statue of Mari,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
we notice that she has
rings on her wrists

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
and holds a vase containing
the elixir of immortality.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
She wears the same
necklace as Ishtar.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And her necklace, too, was
originally rainbow-colored

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and dotted with blue stones.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And she wears the
Shugurra helmet.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Literally translated,
says Zecharia Sitchin,

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Shugurra means that which
makes go far into the universe.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask,
what kind of a helmet

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
can we put on that takes
us far into the universe?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And can we get one at Best Buy
or another appliance store?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
One can hardly fault Mr.
Sitchin for interpreting

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
this collection of tools as
some kind of a space suit.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It does look very technological,
like something out of a NASA

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:90%
space suit design.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
However, this
interpretation severs us

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
from the possibility
of developing

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
the capabilities these
symbols represent from within

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and developing
ourselves spiritually.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
As we move forward
1,000 years later

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egyptian belief,
we see that Tutankhamen also

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
wears the royal robe,
called the Karast garment,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that indicated that he,
too, was an ascended being.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
According to ancient
Egyptian belief,

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Ptah, the god of technology,
fashioned the human body

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and the Karast
resurrection garment.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And in this depiction, he wears
the many-colored feathered

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
resurrection and
ascension garment

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
that enabled his ascent
to the heavenly realms.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
He, too, also holds a set
of ascension tools or apps,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
including the resurrection
stick, the helmet of salvation,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
the rings of gold, and
he stands on the block

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic truth called maat
that symbolizes holy ground.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:84%
In this example from the tomb
of Queen Nefertari in Egypt,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:84%
we see Ptah holding
the ascension apps

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and standing before
the multicolored tet

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.305 align:middle line:84%
pillar, which is the symbol
of the power of resurrection.

00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In one of my unique
contributions

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to the study of the
rainbow light body,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I have linked the tools held
by the guru Padmasambhava

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:90%
to Ptah and his tools or apps.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I note this not because I
have an out-of-control ego,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.020 align:middle line:84%
but because the Tibetans
don't connect the symbolism

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
of Padmasambhava the Ptah.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Nor do the Egyptologists
connect the symbolism of Ptah

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:90%
to Padmasambhava.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe the
connection is very strong.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body
is a Tibetan term

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
for the great perfection
or great transfer

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:51.280 align:middle line:84%
into light achieved by Jesus
in his resurrection and others.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The achievement of
perfection is attained

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
by raising or accelerating the
vibration of the human body

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
until it dissolves into
its subtle essences,

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind only hair, toe,
and fingernails, which have

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:90%
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The body then morphs into a
vortex of five-colored rainbow

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
light or what is called
the rainbow body.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
In these depictions,
we see Ptah sitting

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:84%
on his lotus throne, which is
the symbol of divine wisdom.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's also the symbol
of a transportation portal.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Ptah wears the crown of glory.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:10%
He holds the Vajra, the symbol
of compassionate action.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And in his other hand, he
holds the resurrection stick.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:10%
His body emits multi-colored
rays shot with gold.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
When I first slid the
image of Ptah beside Padma,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that they are in
perfect harmony and resonance

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:90%
with one another.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, their symbolism
is interchangeable.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe we can also connect
the rainbow veil of Ishtar

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to the rainbow body
of light as well,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
showing us that this
teaching, in fact,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:90%
derives from the Annunaki.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:10%
We can extend this comparison
to Osiris, the Egyptian god

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:10%
of resurrection, who sits
on his feathered ascension

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:10%
throne that's feathered
because it flies.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the vehicle upon which
he ascends into the stars.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
He holds the crook
and flail, which

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:90%
are symbols of his sovereignty.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And his swirling,
multi-colored atef crown

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is definitely suggestive
of the rainbow light body.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
In this example of Osiris
from the tomb of King Seti,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
we see Osiris on the ascension
throne holding the ascension

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.160 align:middle line:90%
apps exactly like Padmasambhava.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:10%
His feathered throne that
takes Osiris into the stars

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.810 align:middle line:10%
seen at Dendera and it's
the seat of the soul

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:10%
or the mobile throne of
the gods, if you will.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I have pointed out,
the shape of the soul's boat,

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the
Millions of Years,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is shaped exactly like the
way modern science portrays

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Symbolically, the
Egyptian depictions

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
tell us exactly the same
story as the Tibetans.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
A transformed human is on
their celestial thrones

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.720 align:middle line:90%
ascending into the stars.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Based on the
Sumerian depictions,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:84%
we have to imagine that
this throne is radiant,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
just like the star-studded
throne from ancient Mesopotamia

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.190 align:middle line:90%
dating to 1000 BC.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Moving now to 800 BC, we
learn of the Prophet Elijah's

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
ascension.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
As Elijah was headed into heaven
on his Merkabah throne chariot,

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
he turns to his
successor, Elisha,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and he transmits to
him his holy robe.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Scholars believe
this is the same robe

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of light described in
the Sumerian stories

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Annunaki.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And I agree.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:84%
With this robe, Elisha can
now perform the same miracles

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:84%
as Elijah, including healing
the sick, raising the dead,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and ascending to heaven.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Elijah's chariot is the same as
the feather throne of Osiris.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And both are clearly some form
of ascension throne or vehicle.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It completes the ensemble or
collection of ascension apps.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple hundred years
later, in around 578 BC,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
the Babylonian
King Nebuchadnezzar

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
stormed Jerusalem and took
10,000 Jewish people captive,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
including three wise
men from the Temple

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon named Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Nebuchadnezzar forced
them into a fiery furnace.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And when they returned, they
had the Son of God in tow

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I have interpreted this as a
portal or a stargate story.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
What is most amazing
about this story

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is that before these three wise
men entered the fiery furnace,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Daniel says they
put on their coats, their hats,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and their other garments.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The traditional view says these
were only ordinary clothes.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think so.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me that
these three wise men

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
were attired exactly
like Inanna and Ptah

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
in preparation for
their descent or ascent

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:90%
into the fiery furnace.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
They knew they must
accessorize the robe of light

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.250 align:middle line:84%
with the crown or hat
and other garments.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we've seen here is
that for nearly 5,000 years,

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
human transmutation,
transcendence, or ascension

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
into a higher form
has been symbolized

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
by the acquisition of this
power cloak or garment

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and these additional apps.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
This glowing and glorious
cloak was transmittable.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Receiving it and the
other apps, crown

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom, the breastplate,
and other apps,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and internalizing or embodying
these apps made one god-like.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Rather than attired,
I prefer the words

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
embody and internalize,
because these ethereal symbols

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
are clearly inner
abilities or apps that

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
give the wearer the miraculous
super powers of levitation,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
invisibility, super
strength, among other powers.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
These cloaks made the wearer
mighty ones or giants on Earth

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and also enabled
their ultimate goal,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
which is ascension to
other worldly cosmic realms

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%
via portals or gateways.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
From what we have
just seen, these apps

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
are available for us
to be acquired, too,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:90%
because they come from within.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's follow
some stories here

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:56.320 align:middle line:84%
about how we can actually
acquire or activate these apps.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.470 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian tradition, we
learn that Elijah reincarnated

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:90%
as John the Baptist.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And he re-acquired
this power cloak.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
As seen in this mosaic in
San Marco in Florence, Italy,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Elijah re-acquired this
cloak from an angel

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and then transmitted it
to his cousin, Jesus,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
at the baptism,
where an angel can

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
be seen waiting to give
the power cloak to Jesus.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the baptism
represents a transmission

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of this teaching that was
at least 2,500 years old

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:90%
by the time of Jesus.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.280 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Hebrews, Jesus
is known as the high priest

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.130 align:middle line:90%
of the order of Melchizedek.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Jewish priests
wore special attire

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that includes a crown, a
breastplate, a robe shot

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.600 align:middle line:90%
with gold wires, and gold bells.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
These are called the
garments of righteousness.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
In William Blake's
painting, we see a scene

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
of Zacharias, the high priest
of the Temple of Solomon,

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:84%
who struck mute upon learning
that his elderly, barren wife,

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, will give
birth to John the Baptist.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The luminous garments
appear to glow.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The breastplate radiates
rainbow-colored light.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish tradition
when the high priest puts

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
on this collection of items,
he does so in preparation

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
for entering the Holy
of Holies of the Temple

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon, a golden,
cube-shaped room that

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is a re-creation of
the Garden of Eden.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Solomon was
divided into two areas.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
The outer area of the temple
was called the Holy Place.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
A short staircase or ramp
led from the Holy Place

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to a slightly elevated
special inner room

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
called the Most Holy Place
or the Holy of Holies.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:10%
The Most Holy Place
was constructed

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:10%
to house the Ark of
the Covenant, which

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:10%
was the sign, symbol, seal, or
device of the Israelite god,

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.950 align:middle line:10%
Yahweh.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
At the dedication of
the temple, the Ark

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
was moved into the
Holy of Holies.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And when the priest emerged
from this holy place

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
after placing the ark there, the
temple was filled with a cloud.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
For the glory of the Lord had
filled the house of the Lord,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:90%
says the Book of Kings.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And this was described as some
kind of a mysterious rainbow

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.860 align:middle line:90%
energy field.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
What we learn from
this is that Yahweh

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
would manifest upon
the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
as a luminous, humanoid,
rainbow-like figure.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
This, to me, is the
key to discovering

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.530 align:middle line:84%
what the Ark of the
Covenant really is.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of
a teleportation

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:90%
device for rainbow body beings.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:10%
It's also known to scholars as
the Merkabah throne chariot,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:10%
upon which a god can descend and
be made manifest among humans.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.650 align:middle line:10%
When a human sits
on that throne,

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:10%
as did the high priest with
his body clad in these various

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.140 align:middle line:10%
apps, his body is dissolved
into rainbow-colored light that

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:10%
matches Yahweh's.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
In my view, symbolically, the
ark throne and the lotus throne

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan Great
Perfection tradition

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
are exactly the same thing.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Israelite
high priest and Padmasambhava

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
are portrayed with the
same signs, seals, symbols,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
or again, what I call
ascension apps, on their body.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.069 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we can
add Ptah in this linkage.

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be
cautious in my words

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
here, because this
linkage we have just made

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is deadly serious and very
dangerous in the wrong hands.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:84%
There are governments
and organizations

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
who are desperately seeking
this knowledge right now

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.430 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill end-time prophecies.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly don't want
to be of assistance to them.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They seek this knowledge
for the love of power,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:90%
rather than the power of love.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:10%
But I believe that what we are
looking at with the high priest

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:10%
is an individual who has
activated these latent

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:10%
psycho-spiritual attributes
or apps that now prepare him

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.300 align:middle line:10%
to sit on the Ark of the
Covenant or throne chariot

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:10%
and be transported
through the cosmos.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:10%
In this way, the ark
throne is exactly the same

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:10%
as the feathered
ascension throne mounted

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:10%
to the wormhole-shaped Ark
of the Millions of Years

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.150 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:10%
The key here is that the ark
may be a tangible object,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:10%
but it's also a symbol that
goes along with the apps that

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:10%
are activated by the soul.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:10%
And once again, I propose that
the feathered ascension throne

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt and
the rainbow body are,

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:10%
in fact, the same thing.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is the same as
the Sumerian star throne.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:84%
When the high priest
entered the Holy of Holies

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to sit on this
ascension throne, he

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:84%
is said to have passed
a veil into heaven

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and now wore white
linen garments.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
The white linen garment
is the robe of the soul

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and the attire of the
angels and perfected humans

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.920 align:middle line:84%
or just humans made perfect
who have ascended to

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and now dwell at
the throne of God.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
The wearing of this garment
signifies a change of state

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and also a change of form
as the baptized person

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:84%
is now welcomed into
the company of angels.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Central to my thesis that the
ark throne is a teleportation

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
device or a stargate device is
Dr. Margaret Barker's proposal

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that the veil that separated
the Holy Place from the Most

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Holy Place was viewed as
a boundary between heaven

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and earth, between the visible
and the invisible world,

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:90%
between time and eternity.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This veil represented matter,
which veils the presence of God

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.930 align:middle line:90%
from human eyes.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Parting this veil took one
beyond the material world.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Barker observes,
it was believed

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that those who entered
the Holy of Holies

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and sat on the ark throne
entered heaven alive.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And they were transformed upon
entering this golden chamber.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish historian Philo said
that when the high priest, clad

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
in his soul apps, entered
the Holy of Holies,

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.130 align:middle line:90%
he was not a man.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
We read in Leviticus,
as there shall

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
be no man in the
Holy of Holies when

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:90%
he enters to make atonement.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
But Philo translated that as
when the high priest enters

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
the Holy of Holies, he
shall not be a man, showing,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
he said, that the high priest
was now more than human.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
He was no longer a human because
his experience has returned him

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
to the original, pure,
light-being state of Adam

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and the gods and angels.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.720 align:middle line:84%
The people who passed through
the veil, notes Dr. Barker,

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
were the mediators, clad in
their divine priestly garments,

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
their soul apps, who walked
between worlds in order

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
to bring blessings and
the presence of God

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to their people.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the point of
activating these apps within.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:84%
They enable us to
become star walkers,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to walk between worlds,
just like Inanna,

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.437 align:middle line:90%
and to bring blessings to all.

00:25:30.437 --> 00:25:32.020 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish
tradition, these priests

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
had the title of Melchizedek,
meaning King of Righteousness.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And as the Melchizedek high
priest went beyond the veil

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and entered the Holy of
Holies, he entered heaven.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And when he passed
back through the veil,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:90%
he came back down from heaven.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Barker tells how these
priests became angels

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and lights among the living.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
transformation into a divine

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:84%
being in his travel via
stargate was literal as

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:04.990 align:middle line:90%
opposed to merely metaphorical.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And more, because the Essenes
tell us in the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.630 align:middle line:84%
that many people
achieve this, I believe

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:84%
this experience was
psycho-spiritual,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
meaning initiates
visualized this experience

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and activated these
ascension apps from within.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism of the soul
apps or ascension apps

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
was adopted by
Christianity with Jesus

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
as the high priest of
the Order of Melchizedek

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
who passed through
the veil and returned.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We have a great high priest
who is passed through heavens,

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
says the Book of Hebrews.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
The inner sanctuary
behind the curtain

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus who went before
us has entered on our behalf,

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Hebrews continues.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:84%
This is Jan van Eyck's take
on Jesus as the Melchizedek

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
priest.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
Ghent Altarpiece,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the most important painting in
all of human history, perhaps.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Jesus as the high priest sits
on a concealed throne, which

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.400 align:middle line:90%
is the Ark of the Covenant.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
He wears the bejeweled
breastplate of righteousness.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:90%
He radiates rainbow light.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And he wears the jeweled
crown of salvation.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And he holds the
stick of resurrection.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's compare this
image with Padmasambhava

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:90%
on the lotus throne.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Both Padmasambhava and Jesus
hold symbols, or tools,

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
including the crown of
light, a wand or staff that

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
opens the gate to heaven,
which is the same as Ptah's

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:90%
holy resurrection stick.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And they both radiate a
rainbow-colored light.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
To me, these are the mystical,
psycho-spiritual attributes

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.580 align:middle line:84%
or ascension apps of
the perfect humans.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
The whole or holy ones of
various traditions that

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
you've just seen has at least
a 5,000-year-old history.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Humans who attain
these apps on the way

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to their own
spiritual perfection

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:90%
derive huge earthly benefits.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why we
want to pursue these mysteries.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
They, for one,
have better health.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Whole people are happy people.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And medically, happy
people are healthier.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:90%
They live longer.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And this grants us an
increased opportunity

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the rainbow body,
which the Tibetans say can

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:90%
be achieved in one lifetime.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
By becoming fully
functioning human beings,

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
though, we serve
the greater good.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is why
we study this subject.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This is Hans Memling's
painting of Christ

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.310 align:middle line:84%
enthroned on a copy of the
Ark of the Covenant in heaven.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Bible says there
are two Arks of the Covenant.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.690 align:middle line:90%
One is on Earth.

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:90%
The other is in heaven.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
As we see here, the ark
throne or the body of Jesus

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:90%
radiates rainbow light.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Christ is once again
enthroned, holding the crown

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:90%
and the resurrection stick.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
We see that he
wears a breastplate.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:02.550 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
ascension apps.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And it indicates that he is a
fully activated human being.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And as we compare the image
of Memling's enthroned Christ

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
with that of
Padmasambhava, we see

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that, once again, the images
tell exactly the same story.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I realize that it's
controversial to make the claim

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that as the high priest of
the order of Melchizedek,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Jesus wears the signs,
seals, and symbols

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and devices of the Annunaki
or Ptah or Padmasambhava.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
However, I believe
that connecting

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.540 align:middle line:84%
these dots represents a
continuous line of teaching

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that, as I said, is at least
5,000 years old and more likely

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
came from star beings
or celestial beings.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Learning to click on these
apps within us transforms us.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know these
apps are symbols.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.190 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul
tells us exactly this.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In his letters to the
officiants, the people

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
living in Ephesus,
Turkey, written

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:84%
while he was in prison
in Rome in AD 62,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the Christian apostle
Paul gives advice

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.890 align:middle line:84%
on living a holy
and a pure life.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:84%
He also warns of
a coming battle.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And he advises Christians
or other believers

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.810 align:middle line:10%
to be strong in the Lord
and in His mighty power.

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:23.650 align:middle line:10%
Put on the full armor of God
so that you can take your stand

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.590 align:middle line:10%
against the devil's schemes.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:10%
For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood,

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.450 align:middle line:10%
but against the rulers,
against the authorities,

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:34.610 align:middle line:10%
against the powers
of this dark world,

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:10%
and against the spiritual forces
of evil in the heavenly realms.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, put on the
full armor of God,

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.360 align:middle line:10%
so that when the
day of evil comes,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:10%
you may be able to
stand your ground,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:10%
and after you have done
everything, to stand.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:10%
Stand firm then, with
the belt of truth

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.390 align:middle line:10%
buckled around your waist,
with the breastplate

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:10%
of righteousness in
place, and with your feet

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:10%
fitted with the readiness that
comes from the gospel of peace.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:10%
In addition to all
this, take up the shield

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.540 align:middle line:10%
of faith, with which
you can extinguish

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.190 align:middle line:10%
all the flaming arrows
of the evil one.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:10%
Take the helmet of salvation
and the sword of spirit,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:10%
which is the word of God.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:10%
Paul is clearly urging us,
meaning the great multitudes

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:10%
of people who have read these
lines, to augment or supplement

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:10%
the human body with a
collection of tools or apps

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:10%
for a battle against
an otherworldly force.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
These cannot be taken as
literal or actual power tools

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.710 align:middle line:84%
or technologies to be acquired,
unless there is some form

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Apple Computer
company or Google who made

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
This suit of cosmic
armor is metaphorical and

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:90%
psycho-spiritual.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's also anagogical, meaning
it has to do with our ascension.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
It is made of apps that we
externalize, embody, or exude,

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:84%
but they are clearly
perfected from within

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and externalized by our actions.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:90%
The belt of truth is just that.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
When we put on this
belt, we are committing

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to speak the truth.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:84%
As Paul says, the use of
this spiritual technology

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:84%
forms a shield of faith,
a suit of cosmic armor,

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
or a second skin that seals and
protects us and also permits

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.920 align:middle line:84%
access to realms
normally off limits

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:34.060 align:middle line:84%
to humans who are
clothed in ordinary skin.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what the Sumerians

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:90%
described the Annunaki wearing.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can make it
the argument that it

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:84%
was they who originally brought
this spiritual technology

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
to earth.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
In his letter, Paul
assures the officiants

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that they have the power
to successfully put

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.720 align:middle line:84%
on this new skin or
power suit of armor

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:84%
if they stand firm at
the side of the risen

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Christ in His new
body of rainbow light.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not really a skin, but it's
referred to as celestial flesh.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is really
powerful, because once again,

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:84%
it tells us that these spiritual
enlightenment or ascension

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.040 align:middle line:90%
apps are attainable by all.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The question is, do you believe
you can activate these apps?

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
One's choice of answers
sets one's life course.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And Paul's letter
also makes clear

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
that the reason we seek to
put on this miracle power

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
garment or second skin is not
just to improve the human body

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and live a righteous
and whole or holy life

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.280 align:middle line:84%
but also to protect ourselves
from predatory powers

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual forces of evil in
the hierarchy of the heavenly

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
realms that seek
to impede our rise.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Bluntly, Paul is telling us to
activate the armor of God apps

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:84%
from within to counter
an alien threat.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
So who or what and where are
these principalities, powers,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.780 align:middle line:84%
rulers, and archons
who Paul says

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
come from high places
or heavenly realms?

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what the
modern-day disclosure movement

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:90%
is all about.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Modern UFO and alien
researchers claim

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that there are predatory
aliens from outer space

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
who wield super
advanced technology.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:84%
This sometimes invisible
and predatory alien

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.389 align:middle line:84%
race hides behind the
veil of human history.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But gnostic writings from the
first century AD discovered

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in Nag Hammadi, Egypt in 1945,
including the Gospel of Philip,

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
which I discussed in the
Robe of Light episode,

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
contain warnings
and descriptions

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:84%
of the alien
predators they called

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.210 align:middle line:84%
archons, who see themselves
as rulers of humanity,

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:90%
or the human mind, anyway.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Jesus spoke directly of them
and advised how to avoid them.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.500 align:middle line:84%
As researcher John Lash
has observed in his book,

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.870 align:middle line:84%
"Not in His Image," based
on the physical descriptions

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of the archons in the
gnostic materials,

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:84%
we may equate them with Grey
and reptilian-type alien beings

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of contemporary ET
investigations and reports.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Lash is in tune with
"The Song of the Greys,"

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the 1997 work of
Nigel Kerner, who

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:84%
proposed the greys
are non-organic,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:84%
They are robots or machines
who want souls and seek

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.310 align:middle line:84%
to create a hybrid human
being in hopes that they

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.310 align:middle line:90%
will attain our divine sparks.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:84%
The reptilians are otherworldly
human serpent beings,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.710 align:middle line:84%
described in the Essenes'
Book of Enoch, among others.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
They are described sometimes
us teachers, but other times

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.560 align:middle line:90%
as betrayers of humankind.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes say they gave
humanity the secret of heaven

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and in, fact the
secret of ascension.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Lash proposes that the gnostics
warn that the archons invade

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:56.690 align:middle line:90%
the human psyche, our soul.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And they intrude mentally
and psychologically,

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:84%
although they may also
confront us physically as well.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:84%
During forcible
modern abductions,

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:84%
the robotic greys are
believed to implant

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
technological devices
within human bodies.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.770 align:middle line:84%
This intrusion potentially
disables our ability

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to put on the
spiritual armor of God.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.790 align:middle line:84%
This is what Jesus
came to teach us to do

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:90%
is to put on this cosmic armor.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And in Lash's view,
the gnostics taught

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that the true mind of human
beings, the nous authenticos,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.720 align:middle line:84%
is part of a cosmic intelligence
that pervades nature.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.140 align:middle line:84%
But due to the intrusion
of the archons,

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.460 align:middle line:84%
this native mind or native
genius can be subverted

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and even occupied
by another mind.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The threat is that once we go
grey and have this technology

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.500 align:middle line:84%
within us, the force
is no longer with us.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The alien mind penetrates into
our storytelling activities,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:84%
says Lash, and the
narrative power

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.440 align:middle line:84%
so crucial for humanity to
make its way in its cosmos

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.180 align:middle line:90%
is subverted.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.490 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the ways, or
perhaps the most effective way,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Lash proposes, that we are
deviated from our proper course

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual evolution.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Human resistance to
the archon intrusion

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.200 align:middle line:84%
depends on getting
our story straight

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.720 align:middle line:84%
about who we are
as spiritual beings

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and what we are capable of
doing, spiritually speaking.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It also depends on
our inner composure

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and our mental discipline,
the sobriety of the warrior,

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.620 align:middle line:90%
says Lash.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Where the mind goes,
the biology follows

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:90%
is a bio-spiritual adage.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And for the human species
to achieve ascension

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and transcendence, we
must have stories, plots,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and narratives that can guide
us from initial conception

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.660 align:middle line:90%
to our final goal.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the gnostics
rehearsed ascension stories

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and visualized the robe of glory
and the soul rising or soul

00:37:54.890 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
ascent to the throne of
God over and over again.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.220 align:middle line:84%
In our journey, we have
traced over 5,000 years

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of recorded history and
stories about the ascension

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.990 align:middle line:90%
apps of the soul.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:90%
We now know those are within us.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have seen this message
transmitted over and over

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:90%
Get the robe of light, they say.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget
the crown of wisdom,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:84%
the breastplate
of righteousness,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the belt of truth, and
the sandals of peace.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Get, perhaps, is the wrong word,
because what we're really doing

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
is revealing these
apps from within.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
episode, we will reveal

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
one more soul app, the hidden
one, perhaps the most important

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.620 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, be humble, let
your light shine, and namaste.
