00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM HENRY: What if a
painting could connect you

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to a divine light
that transforms you?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.026 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE HENRY:
Today on "Arcanum,"

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:17.983 align:middle line:84%
transfiguration icons
and the holy light.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAM: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Today we are going
to explore sacred mirrors,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:84%
specifically how certain works
of art called transfiguration

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
icons are considered sacred
mirrors and even portals

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:90%
to other realms.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Let's talk about
mirrors for a moment.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Mirrors help us navigate
our everyday world.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: A rear-view
mirror in our car helps us see

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
what's coming.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Mirrors placed at the corner
of buildings or streets

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:90%
help us to see what's ahead.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:90%
The mirror is a threshold.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: We stand before a
mirror before leaving our home

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
or car to see what we will
look like or how we will appear

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.601 align:middle line:90%
for what is ahead.

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: As in the
story of Snow White,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
who famously asked the mirror,
mirror, mirror, on the wall,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
who in this realm is
fairest of them all?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
The mirror never lies.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: The symbolism
associated with the mirror has

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
its roots in the
very distant past.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact is no matter what
your spiritual background is,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the mirror is an
important spiritual symbol

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.009 align:middle line:90%
and tool.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Some of the oldest
drawings found on temple walls

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
and papyrus scrolls depict
images of the Egyptian gods

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
gazing into hand-held mirrors.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The Arcanum is traced
to the Egyptian divine

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
being Thoth, who stands
before his mirror.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: The mirror also has
an esoteric or mystic meaning.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient people
regarded mirrors

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
as mysterious and magical
tools to view spiritual guides

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and receive messages
from beyond as well.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: The mirror
is a symbol of physical

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual reflection.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Just as a mirror can show us how
we presently physically appear

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and what may be behind
or ahead of us, so too

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
does our spiritual mirror
reflect our past actions.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Take a
look around you.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It is the consequence
of your actions

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
that have created what
you see around you.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
What do you see when you look
into your spiritual mirror?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.594 align:middle line:84%
What people, places, and
events are behind you?

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: By gazing
in the spiritual mirror,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
we are looking directly at what
we have created for ourselves.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Now that's
a bitter pill.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
What if, upon reflecting
on what we see,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
we don't like where we've
been, what is coming,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:90%
or where in fact we are going?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Fortunately, the
symbolism of the mirror offers

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
answers.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.170 align:middle line:84%
First, the key piece of
wisdom about the mirror

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
is that it only reflects
what is currently true.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
This means you can
change your course.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:84%
We can change what we are
contemplating, meditating,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:90%
or reflecting on.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Second, in order for
a mirror to cast a reflection,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:90%
it requires light.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And symbolically, light
represents illumination,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.176 align:middle line:90%
enlightenment, and wisdom.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Taking a cue from
early Christian alchemists,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
they believed you could create
sacred mirrors called icons

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that could assist us in
drawing down a light or power

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Can images really help us
to draw in divine energy

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and even to transform us?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Next, in William's
feature investigation,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
we will investigate
transfiguration icons and how

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
they do just that.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.507 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: The great Scottish
symbolist and mythologist

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Harold Bayley once wrote that
"mysticism has universally

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
taught that every man and woman
has within themselves the germs

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
or seeds of divinity and
that by self-conquest--"

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps self-knowledge,
self-awakening "--these sparks

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
of heaven may be fanned into a
flame, the flame into a fire,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the fire into a star,
and the star into a sun."

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's the
eternal progression

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
evolving toward, to go

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
from human to celestial
being or star being.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
In Western civilization,
Judeo-Christian civilization

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
or culture, Jesus, of course,
is the ultimate exemplar

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:90%
of this transformation.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
He in his life demonstrated
the way or path

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to go from human, man, to
star being or celestial being.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And in these images of
the Transfiguration,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
we see him enfolded
within the light that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
appears to be that of a star.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
The Transfiguration of Jesus
refers to his transformation

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or shapeshifting into a shining
cosmic being, a light being,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and back into flesh,
one of the most

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary miracles
of Jesus' teaching.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And in this example
here, we see him

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
with his bright white
garment of light,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
enfolded within
this star energy,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating this
transformation.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The Transfiguration
of Jesus is one

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
of the most transcendent
yet bizarrely neglected

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
events ever recorded in
myth or sacred tradition.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is because it
sounds mystical, too mystical,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
in the extreme,
even preposterous,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
like the story of a genie
coming out of a bottle.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But over and over again
in the Gnostic text

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Jesus emphasized
that he, in fact,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:90%
was a celestial or a star being.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:84%
In the Revelation
of the Magi, we

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
see the Magi awaiting not a
star but rather following a star

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
child, as the text
describes Jesus.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
We see him here manifesting
in the Earth plane

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:90%
as a celestial or star being.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
In this other example here
of Jesus with the star child,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
we see the Magi following not
the star but the star child

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
or star man, a
completely different take

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:90%
on this nativity idea.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Midway through his
ministry, Jesus

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
took three disciples,
Peter, James, and John,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and slipped off secretly
to a high mountain

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
on the borderland between
the human and divine.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
He had something to show
them, something extraordinary.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, says Mark,
Jesus becomes radiant.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
His clothing becomes
bright as lightning.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
He glistens.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly Elijah
and Moses manifest,

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
as if out of thin
air, and perhaps

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
they too are illuminated
or shimmering,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:90%
translucent just like Jesus.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
In Eastern art, we see the
Transfiguration portrayed

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in this way with
Moses and Elijah

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
on either side of Jesus, who
is portrayed as a star being.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps like a moment out
of the movie "Cocoon,"

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
he has pulled back his flesh
and revealed his true self.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what he's revealing
in the Gnostic sense

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:90%
is the true self of all of us.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
We are all, in fact, celestial
or star children temporarily

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
inhabiting the world
of flesh and matter.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:84%
The disciples and
Jesus discuss events

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
to come in Jerusalem, the
crucifixion, resurrection,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:90%
and ascension.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And through terrified
eyes, the disciples

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
watch as their friend,
their brother indeed,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:84%
suddenly morphs right
before their very eyes.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:84%
They fall prostrate before
Jesus in utter fear and terror

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
of what they have
just witnessed.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
God speaks to the disciples
from a cloud telling them

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:90%
that everything is OK.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And then finally Jesus
delivers the key message

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.387 align:middle line:84%
to the disciples telling them
to rise and not be afraid.

00:08:14.387 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I believe what he's
saying is for them

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to elevate their consciousness,
to raise their vibration

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to match that of Jesus, to match
that of this wondrous celestial

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
or star being within us.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
He's calling them to
transform and to acknowledge

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
their true selves
and to manifest

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:90%
their full human potential.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The earliest known
version, in fact

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:84%
the standard depiction
of the Transfiguration,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is found in an apse mosaic
at St. Catharine's monastery

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:90%
in the Sinai.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It dates to around 540 AD.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here
is Jesus enfolded

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:84%
within this blue cosmic egg,
radiating seven rays of light.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
He's, in a sense, the original
Lord of the Seven Rays,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
if you will, a very important
distinction in the wisdom

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So after that time, other
artists and icon makers

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
began to adopt
this idea of Jesus

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
as the celestial or star man.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we see in the
Transfiguration icons is where

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
he's on the top of
the mountain, Moses

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and Elijah on either
side, typically

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:84%
in this radiant cloud, which is
actually going to be something

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
else, as we'll see in a moment,
radiating this immense divine

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
light or wisdom that is
capable of transforming humans

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
on contact, as in the
story of the disciples.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a favorite
example here from Russia.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We see Jesus in the cosmic
egg, the cosmic egg of light,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.176 align:middle line:84%
radiating three rays of light,
which is extremely important

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
as well in the
mystery tradition,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about
that momentarily.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
We see the disciples
in fear or terror

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
being challenged to raise
their vibration, Moses

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and Elijah on either side.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So these become the
prototype, if you will,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
for all images of the
Transfiguration of Jesus.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:90%
This is the basic set up.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And we have to imagine
that Moses and Elijah must

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
be at a similar frequency
or vibration as Jesus.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
They must have come
from another realm

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly manifested
in the world of matter.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a favorite image.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I took this photo in the
Coptic Christian church

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:90%
in Aswan, Egypt.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason I liked it is because
it very tastefully but subtly

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
includes the
Egyptian nemes crown,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
the crown of the
pharaohs, hinting

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.860 align:middle line:84%
at the Egyptian or esoteric
origins of the Transfiguration

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.210 align:middle line:84%
As usual, Moses and
Elijah are on either side.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And once again, Jesus
is in the cosmic egg,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
the light-filled egg,
radiating three rays.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Now why are the three
rays are important?

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Here's the reason.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:10%
When you go into the Egyptian
hieroglyphic dictionary, EA

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:10%
Wallis Budge's dictionary, you
look up a very powerful word

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:10%
called aakhut,
which means beings

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:10%
of light, wise instructed
folk, the light god,

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:10%
the great light, the sun.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:10%
And what we notice is that
the hieroglyph of the aakhu,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:10%
which also means to shine, to
be bright, splendid, glorious,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:10%
excellent, good, is
actually three rays

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.920 align:middle line:10%
radiating from the
image of the sun,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:10%
the S-U-N. When we put
that beside the image

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:10%
of the Transfiguration
with Jesus

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:10%
in the cosmic egg radiating
three rays, what do you know?

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the same symbol.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Are they hinting
here that Jesus is

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:84%
part of the aakhut,
the beings of light,

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:90%
the wise instructed folk?

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important question,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
because according to
Egyptian tradition

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
it was the aakhut who
built the Great Pyramid

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:90%
complex on the Giza Plateau.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
In Budge's hieroglyphic
dictionary,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
the following additional
definitions of aakhu

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
are provided, to be bright,
to be excellent, to be wise,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:90%
or to be instructed.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
What exactly are the
aakhu instructed in?

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
How about transformation?

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:84%
How about the
alchemical metamorphosis

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
of a human into a
celestial being or a star

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
being, a wise being of light?

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:84%
As Graham Hancock
and Robert Bauval

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.743 align:middle line:84%
explain in their book "The
Message of the Sphinx,"

00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the hieroglyphs
of aakhu can also

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
mean transfigured beings,
shining ones, shining beings,

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
again suggesting
that Jesus is part

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of this tribe of cosmic beings
who came to Earth with a very

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:84%
specific teaching, that is, how
humans can morph into celestial

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.649 align:middle line:90%
or star beings.

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Moving forward into
the 12th century,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
we see this beautiful mosaic
where Jesus is, once again,

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmic egg, seven
rays radiating from his body.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.351 align:middle line:84%
He is the Lord of
the Seven Rays.

00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I particularly like this one
because it brings forward

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
this blue light.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.454 align:middle line:84%
The idea is is that we can't
perceive the divine realm,

00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and so what these
artists would do

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
is they would show the light
radiating inward, going

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
from light to dark, and the dark
hinting at the imperceptible

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:90%
to human consciousness.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:90%
It's dark or hidden to us.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we're going inward
from light into the dark realm.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus, in fact, comes
out of this hidden realm

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.813 align:middle line:84%
into the light in
the Transfiguration.

00:13:22.813 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Another favorite is Fra
Angelico's powerful, powerful

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
"Transfiguration"
in Florence, Italy,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.410 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus, once again,
is in the cosmic egg.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
He's in the cosmic egg of light.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
The disciples are terrified.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:84%
We have Moses and Elijah,
as usual, on either side.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's welcoming us.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
He's opening his heart to us
and radiating this light to us,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:84%
beaming it to us, in
fact, and asking us,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
challenging us to rise
and not be afraid,

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
to embrace this next
level within ourselves.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
There are numerous names
for this bright shining

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:84%
white garment of light that
Jesus is dressed in here.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It's called the robe of
light, the robe of sanctity,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the robe of glory, the shining
garment, the garment of light,

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow body of light,
and also my favorite,

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
a term from ancient Iran,
the beaming garment.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I like this term because
it suggests a pun.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It's called the beaming
garment because when

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Jesus puts on this
garment of light

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:90%
he's beaming or radiating light.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll see in a moment,
in the Star Trek vernacular

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
beaming means to dissolve
ourselves into light

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.037 align:middle line:84%
and then to recompose
ourselves at another location.

00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that is also what's

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:84%
happening in the Transfiguration
is that Jesus is demonstrating

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
his ability to dissolve
himself into light,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
beam himself through the cosmos,
and then morph back into flesh

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
once again, a really
powerful idea.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
The Greek word that is used to
describe this garment of light

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:90%
is exousia.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
It means authority,
jurisdiction, liberty, power,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
right to act, ability,
privilege, capacity,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
attributes that we

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
gain by matching our vibration
with Jesus', of not being

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
afraid of our potential
but rather to rise

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and match our frequency
as close as we

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:90%
can to these celestial beings.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, we gain
true authority, true liberty,

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
true capacity, and true strength
that cannot be taken away from

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
of the Gnostics.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they know of beings
out there in our world, Archons

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and other beings,
that seek to take

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
our divine spark that we
seek to fan into a flame

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and into a star and into
a sun and prevent us

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:84%
from attaining this
ultimate liberty and power.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
combat these beings,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
whether they be celestial
beings or earthly powers that

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
seek to prevent us
from enjoying liberty,

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
is to raise our vibration and
put on our garment of light.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is another reason,
again, for answering the call

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:90%
to Transfiguration.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So where did Jesus get
this garment of light?

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Bible tells
us that he got it

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
from John the Baptist, his
cousin, the Essene mystic

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist,
who is shown here

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:84%
baptizing Jesus in
the River Jordan.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And we notice the
angel is waiting

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.420 align:middle line:84%
to give Jesus his cloak
or garment of light.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:84%
It's after this baptism when
Jesus gets the garment that he

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
then goes and begins
performing his miracles.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.060 align:middle line:90%
So we ask a question.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.792 align:middle line:84%
From where did John the
Baptist get the cloak?

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Ah, very good question.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's claimed he was the
reincarnation of the Old

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Testament prophet
Elijah, who was last

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
seen ascending into the
heavens in a whirlwind.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:90%
A vortex, a portal, a stargate?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Mm hmm.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And as John is ascending on
his chariot of fire, which

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of his
celestial vehicle,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:84%
he turns to his priest
Elisha and transmits to him

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
his holy garment, his mantle
of light, the very same garment

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that John will then
transmit to Jesus.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Here we're looking at a
classically rendered icon

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of Elijah ascending into
heaven in his fiery chariot,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
as described in
the Book of Kings.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
And as he departs,
he drops his mantle

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
to his successor, Elisha, who
is shown on the lower left.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So here's John in his
celestial chariot ascending.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
He has no need any longer now
for this transmittable garment

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of light, and so he offers
it to his priest, Elisha,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
so that then this
tradition can continue.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
To me, this suggests
something very important

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:90%
about this garment of light.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It may be an actual
physical garment.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.575 align:middle line:84%
But more than likely,
what it really is

00:17:51.575 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
is a transmittable
vibration that

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
is attained by these
beings that then they

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:90%
can impart to other individuals.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And that, I propose, is
what's happening here.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be in
the baptistery in San

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Marco in Venice, Italy,
and I snapped this photo

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of the angel delivering that
garment to John the Baptist.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
That could be Elijah
that's in fact doing this,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
but the key is that
in Christian tradition

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
it's believed that
John the Baptist is

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.410 align:middle line:84%
in fact the
reincarnation of Elijah,

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
so of course he's
going to pick up

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
where he left off in
his previous life.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
He's going to go get that
vibration that gives him

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
capacity, strength, power, and
authority, as well as liberty.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So John reacquires the
vibration of the garment.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And then what does he do?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Now he's prepared
once he puts it on

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
to then baptize
his cousin Jesus.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So John is now
wearing the garment,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and he's now transmitting
the vibration of that garment

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:90%
to Jesus in the baptism.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the dove
descending, the star energy,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic vibration descending,
and then afterward now Jesus

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is clothed in that
garment light,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and off he goes to
perform the miracles.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing he does
once he acquires that garment

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is hike the disciples up
to the top of Mount Tabor

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and reveal his
newfound capability.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary isn't it?

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:84%
As alchemist
Marie-Louise von Franz

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:84%
observes in "Aurora Consurgens,"
when the neophyte achieved

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
this inner transformation
and rebirth,

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:84%
they were given a new heavenly
garment or celestial garment.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The archetypal image of
the coat of many colors

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
or many-colored garment,
the cloak of light,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
played a central role in
the ancient mystery schools.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about that
in a later episode.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:84%
For now, we want to note
that this garment represented

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
the initiate's qualification
or seal, referred

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to as their solificatio,
for which reason

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
is that it's described as
a light or a seal of light.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It seals the body in light.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
It protects us.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Gnostic
texts tell us

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Archons and
the powers can't even

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
see us when we're wearing
this garment of light.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.070 align:middle line:84%
More motivation for us to adopt
this teaching today and absorb

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
this light or
frequency or vibration

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
as a way to protect
ourselves from the powers

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that be that many believe are
running out of control today.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' Transfiguration
is, of course,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:84%
associated with radiance,
whiteness, light, fire,

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
all three alchemical elements
being closely related

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to frequency, vibration,
electromagnetic energies,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
but also a ring,
because the word

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
ring is a pun on
the word vibration.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So literally Jesus is ringing or
singing at a higher vibration.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this is
what the icon artists

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
are trying to convey here
with the light or vibration

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
manifesting around Jesus'
body is that he is radiating

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
this electromagnetic frequency
or, indeed, this sound

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.705 align:middle line:84%
or vibration that
transforms us on contact.

00:21:08.705 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Those closest to
Jesus were told we're

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.700 align:middle line:84%
able to attune to the
electromagnetic energies

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.080 align:middle line:84%
of this lightbody and
interact with Jesus.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we have to
raise our vibration in order

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:90%
to perceive these beings.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And the disciples are
given kind of a bum rap

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:90%
in traditional Christianity.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
They're thought of as kind
of these dimwit farmers

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and fishermen and shepherds.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:84%
To hang out with Jesus
in his inner circle,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
they had to be some
extraordinary beings.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, what
they went through

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:84%
is a process of
initiation that enabled

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
them to awaken their
consciousness so that they

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.135 align:middle line:84%
could even perceive these
higher vibrational beings, Moses

00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
and Elijah and
Jesus, to begin with.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And that prepared
them for this moment.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.902 align:middle line:84%
After the Transfiguration, Jesus
returns to normal human form,

00:22:01.902 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
flesh and blood, and they
walk back down the mountain

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Jesus tells the
disciples, hey, I'd

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
appreciate it if you'd keep
quite of what you've just seen.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they call this
the Messianic Secret.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.190 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, Jesus
didn't want the word out

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
that he was a celestial
being, a star being,

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and had this
incredible capability

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to peel back the flesh
and reveal himself

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
as being of immense
light and, indeed, love.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Matthew and Mark
called this event

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
the Transfiguration
or the metamorphosis.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
The word transfigured comes
from the Greek verb metamorphoo,

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning changed in
form or transformed.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of our
English word metamorphosis.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a change of form, like a
caterpillar into a butterfly

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.750 align:middle line:90%
or a tadpole into a frog.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
They go through a metamorphosis
or a change of form.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Literally they shapeshift.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Psyche, it happens, is the
Greek word for butterfly.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And psyche, the anima or soul,
was symbolized or represented

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:90%
by the butterfly.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So we see this confluence
of symbols and words

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:90%
coming together here.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, in a sense, what
we're looking at here

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.252 align:middle line:84%
is Jesus as the
butterfly being in a way.

00:23:20.252 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think
of it this way.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I once saw a cartoon of
two caterpillars looking up

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
at the butterfly
saying, you'll never

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
get me up in one
of those things.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And essentially that's
our core predicament.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe that we can
morph into a Christ-like being.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe we can put
on this garment of light

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and attain authority, power,
jurisdiction, liberty,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
capacity, and strength.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:90%
Therefore we don't.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we?

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the answer is
our culture and our religion.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.650 align:middle line:84%
How dare you think
you can even come

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
close to matching the vibration
of a being of light and love

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
like Jesus?

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
That's essentially the
core message of the Church.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:90%
We're supposed to fear this.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
But actually the
Gnostic message is

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:90%
is that we are to become this.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is the
only way, they teach,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
get off this rock.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So in my view, with
all due respect,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
our goal and
objective is to learn

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to morph as Jesus taught, to
connect with this divine light

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
or love, and attain this
capacity and strength on behalf

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:90%
of the divine realm.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We seek this vibration
not for our glory

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:84%
but for the glory of
God, for the glory

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos and the universe.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
We are, in a sense,
the caterpillar

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:90%
engaging in the butterfly.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you think a caterpillar
needs to go to school,

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.430 align:middle line:84%
take a motivational
seminar to learn

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.860 align:middle line:90%
how to become a butterfly?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It's hardwired within us.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
the metamorphosis

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and transfiguration
into light beings

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:90%
is also hardwired into our DNA.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:90%
How do we turn the key?

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.985 align:middle line:84%
How do we start the engine
that's already within us?

00:25:02.985 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Ah, now we're talking the
questions and the language

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of the icon makers,
because they proposed

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
a very simple but powerful
answer to that question.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
In Transfiguration
images, the cloud

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is portrayed in front
of is often an open gate.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we'll see is that it's
sometimes filled with stars

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:84%
or composed of various
geometric shapes,

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:84%
such as an almond-shaped
mandorla or vesica

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
piscis, which is symbolic
of a gateway, that's

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:90%
also filled with stars.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this Russian
example of the Transfiguration.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is wearing the
garment of light.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:90%
He's in this cloud?

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.592 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look like any
cloud I've ever seen.

00:25:45.592 --> 00:25:46.675 align:middle line:90%
This looks like a gateway.

00:25:46.675 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And look, it's
filled with stars,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:84%
indicating to me
that perhaps what

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is, in fact, standing
in front of is a stargate?

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
What if, in the
Transfiguration, Jesus

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:84%
puts on that garment of
light and then demonstrates

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.100 align:middle line:90%
a two-step process.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Put on the garment of
light, and then you

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:84%
have the capacity
to open the gateway

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:90%
or portal to the divine realm.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Now we're talking.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Now we're inside
the deep metaphysics

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:19.625 align:middle line:90%
of esoteric Christianity.

00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
Gnostics talked about,

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is what must have
been on the minds of these icon

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:90%
makers.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:84%
They are demonstrating this
two-step process for us.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:90%
We raise our vibration.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.050 align:middle line:90%
First we overcome fear.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.270 align:middle line:84%
We embrace the love of God
and the universe and the love

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
This assists us in
raising our vibration.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And once we have our
vibration in place,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.020 align:middle line:84%
now we're prepared to open the
gateway to the divine realm

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and interact with the
other divine beings.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So did Jesus in fact open
a portal or a stargate

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:90%
at the Transfiguration?

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I call this stargate metaphysics
or stargate Christianity.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.302 align:middle line:84%
Because in my view, this
what it's all about.

00:27:03.302 --> 00:27:05.326 align:middle line:90%
It's all about our preparation.

00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in the
Old Testament we

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
had been kicked out
of the Garden of Eden

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:84%
when the Old Testament
god Yahweh got

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:84%
upset with Adam and
Eve for acquiring

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the serpent.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
He evicts humankind from
Eden and does two things.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
He creates a gate
at the east of Eden,

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:84%
places seraphim angels on
either side of that gate,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and a flashing, flaming
sword in the center

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and forbids us to
access that gate.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But then he does something
else that most people

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.970 align:middle line:90%
have forgotten about.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:36.601 align:middle line:84%
He made for humankind
coats of skin.

00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Now traditional Bible teachers
will tell you, oh, yeah, that

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
must have been some kind
of calf skin or deer

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:90%
skin or some other animal skin.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in the
esoteric tradition,

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic tradition,
they will teach you

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about our flesh

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
as the coats of skin
that were created for us.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the belief is we're
originally beings of light,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're now walking around
in the world of matter

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:90%
in these suits.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, our goal
is to dissolve this back

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:84%
into our original
essence, light and love,

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and then access that
gate to paradise.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Alternately, this gate
that we're describing here

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
is composed of concentric rings
in Transfiguration art that

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:84%
indicate depth as
well as dimension

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
but also vibration,
concentric rings

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
indicating sound waves or
vibration radiating outward.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Today we use terms such
as stargate and wormhole

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to denote such holes
in space and time.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this
image from Byzantium

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:84%
here of the
Transfiguration, Moses,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Elijah on either side, Jesus and
the concentric rings radiating

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.162 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:28:44.162 --> 00:28:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And it looks to me like he's
got some kind of problem

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:90%
with Elijah.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe Elijah said,
hey, Jesus, yeah,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:90%
humans morph into light beings?

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is like, well,
here's the power symbol for you

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:90%
right here, Elijah.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Take it for what it's worth.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I realize that in
ancient Byzantium

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of
this finger symbol

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.100 align:middle line:84%
might have had a different
meaning than it does today.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But still it kind of works
on that level, doesn't it?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Another favorite
example, this one

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.820 align:middle line:10%
also coming from Russia,
Jesus in the stargate,

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:10%
holding the scroll of the law,
in the bright white garment

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:10%
of light.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:10%
He's in the stargate.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:10%
And what happens here is
that this one, for me,

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.910 align:middle line:10%
triggers that what we
must be describing here

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:10%
is a change in form,
a metamorphosis that

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:10%
begins from within.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It begins by accessing our
ladder, tower, or stairway

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to heaven within us,
our chakra system.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.505 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we count the
chakras one, two, three, four,

00:29:38.505 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:90%
five, six, seven.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.030 align:middle line:90%
All good children go to heaven.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the children's
song we all grow up with,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and now we know
the inner meaning

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of that children's song.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We're all climbing this
mountain of transfiguration,

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
which is really the
mountain of initiation.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Each of us is on the path.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
We're at some level of
raising our vibration.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we're
all going to one day

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
reach the top of that mountain
where we can see into the star

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.760 align:middle line:84%
realms and connect with the
celestial or star beings.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is the primary
message of the Transfiguration

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is to rise and not be
afraid on this path.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The object, of course, in
the alchemical tradition

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is to get past the
gatekeeper and find

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the hidden philosopher's
stone, which,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
as we have indicated in
the episode of that name,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.170 align:middle line:84%
is actually our pineal
gland, and the mountain

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're climbing is our
rod of power within us.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So the alchemists
were very well aware

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
of this idea of metamorphosis
or transfiguration,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.730 align:middle line:84%
which they symbolized
by the phoenix.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of the alchemical
mountain in this instance

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.830 align:middle line:84%
is, of course,
Hermes or Thoth, who

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is the great originator
of the Arcanum tradition.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Apart from being taught
in the Hogwarts school

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Harry Potter
universe, the transfiguration

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.680 align:middle line:84%
is basically utterly
neglected in the West, which

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
predominantly worships images of
the bloodied and tortured Jesus

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than an image
of transcendence.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.080 align:middle line:90%
That's our culture.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of Christian
churches around America

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
will show you images
of the bloodied

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and beat up Jesus
and completely omit

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:90%
the idea of the Transfiguration.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's just too mystical,
too intense for most people

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:90%
to embrace.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:84%
However, in the mystical East
of the first six centuries

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.320 align:middle line:84%
AD and later magnificently from
the 14th to the 17th century,

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.290 align:middle line:84%
astonishingly energetic
and elegantly beautiful

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
images of
transfiguration of Jesus

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
levitating and radiating light,
light radiating from his body

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:84%
entranced the imagination
and empowered people

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to actually activate this
capability within ourselves.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
These masterpieces were actually
considered a visual counterpart

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.550 align:middle line:90%
to the written gospels.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Remember, most people
couldn't read at this time,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
but they sure could
look at an image.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these images
were revered as holy.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The Gospels themselves
communicate the biblical truth

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:90%
through words.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The icons communicated through
visible forms, through symbols,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, through
vibration and the energy

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:90%
of the icons themselves.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And both were considered equally
valid modes of revelation.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And this was the primary
principal teaching

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about here
is that people would have

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
these panel icons
in their homes,

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
access the divine realm

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.810 align:middle line:90%
through these panel icons.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:84%
In the magical alchemical
imagination of the icon makers,

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:56.680 align:middle line:84%
these images were designed
to be actual doors or portals

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:90%
to another world.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Our world and the spiritual
world, the divine realm,

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
are opened to each
other through the icon.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine why the
Western Church was threatened

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
by this, because they wanted
to put a pope or a priest

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.049 align:middle line:84%
in between you and
the divine realm.

00:33:13.049 --> 00:33:14.590 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to put
words you couldn't

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:84%
read in between you
and the divine realm.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The icon makers said, just
contemplate, meditate,

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and reflect on this image.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Look at it and absorb
the energy of it

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and become it and open the
door to the divine realm.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
William Blake in the early
1800s adopted this concept

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in a beautiful way.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's worth bringing his
view into this equation here.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:84%
This is "Albion," representing
fallen humanity, who

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
is being revived by the
picture of the Redeemer.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.960 align:middle line:84%
"Awake, awake, O sleeper
of the land of shadows.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Wake, expand.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I am in you and you in me,
mutual and love divine,"

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.980 align:middle line:84%
wrote William Blake,
who was also a poet.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The message here is that
Albion becomes what he sees.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the key message
of the icon makers.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And here Blake is following
Paracelsian doctrine,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:84%
which simply means that what a
human thinks he is or she is.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
If we think we are
transfiguring and ascending

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.280 align:middle line:84%
as we are looking
at an icon, we are.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.850 align:middle line:84%
That's such a simple
mode of revelation,

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:84%
and this is why it
was readily adopted

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:84%
by the icon makers and great
painters like Botticelli,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.670 align:middle line:84%
William Blake, and others who we
are discussing in this series.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
So here's the idea is that
these transfiguration icons were

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:84%
specially created to create
or enable a visceral encounter

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:84%
with a holy being or to make
present a spiritual energy.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:84%
They are a form
of visual alchemy

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that can help is in our
own Transfiguration,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.825 align:middle line:90%
if that's your path.

00:34:58.825 --> 00:35:00.700 align:middle line:84%
How many times have you
been to a movie where

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.550 align:middle line:84%
you had that visceral connection
with something that you saw?

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly powerful.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And in the time
before television,

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:84%
this was the mode
of communication

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that enabled that
visceral experience

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to be transmitted from
one person to another.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the
mirror actually

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
explains the technology
of the icons.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The word icon comes
from the Greek word

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:90%
eikon, which means image.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the New Testament,
the Greek word image

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:84%
also means likeness
and portrait.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is an image, a
likeness, a portrait,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's also a portal as well.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Another term we might
use is projection.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The Old and New Testaments
use the word image

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to describe all of us being
made in the image of the God

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:90%
who made us.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we are mirror
images or icons of the Creator.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a really
heady concept

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to wrap our minds around,
but it explains to us

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:05.440 align:middle line:84%
how we can interact with an
image, and it influences us.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
We are just simply
images engaging

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.690 align:middle line:84%
with the image of a
divine being and absorbing

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the energy of that image,
very simple concept

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and very powerful.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do is get
our left brain out of the way,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.950 align:middle line:84%
open up our right brain, and we
too can receive that vibration.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.580 align:middle line:84%
When used as a verb, the word
mirror means to send back

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
or to form an image of,
to image or reflect.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
To mirror is also to reflect,
and reflection, of course,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.270 align:middle line:84%
produces insight
or enlightenment.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So you see the multi-level
puns that are in effect here

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:90%
with the mirror.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:84%
We engage with the
mirror, an image,

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and this causes us to reflect.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, after we
reflect on the image,

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
especially that of
the Transfiguration,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:84%
then we reflect that
light into our world.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.900 align:middle line:90%
See how this works?

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
The icon itself is a two-way
mode of communication.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We bring the energy into us,
we get insight from the image,

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.530 align:middle line:84%
then we reflect on
that insight, and then

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
we reflect it in our lives
and radiate it into our world.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Just as Alice ponders
what the world

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.295 align:middle line:84%
is like on the other side of
a mirror and, to her surprise,

00:37:24.295 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is able to pass through to
experience the parallel world,

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.280 align:middle line:84%
a person who became adept at
mirroring Jesus' experience

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
of transfiguration could reflect
this process in their own body.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:84%
What an utterly beautiful
and powerful method for us

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to raise our vibration and, in
fact, to transform our world.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if all the
Christian churches in the world

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
took down all those bloody
Jesuses or the images

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of the bloody and beaten
Jesus and instead replaced it

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:84%
with images like
this of transcendence

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:00.540 align:middle line:90%
and reflection of light.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
That would be an
enormous service

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that would be
provided for our world

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:84%
because, as Clare will
show us momentarily,

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
where our mind goes,
the biology follows.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the key equation here.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So as we saturate our mind
with these images of light

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and transcendence, our
biology begins to follow.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a
beautiful system here?

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Transfiguration icons
are sacred images

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:31.830 align:middle line:84%
that are believed to be charged
with a spiritual power that

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.590 align:middle line:90%
is capable of transforming us.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Fascinatingly, icons
of Transfiguration

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
or metamorphosis were considered
these two-way channels

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.490 align:middle line:90%
of transformative energy.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
They are mirrors and gateways to
other realms, the divine realm.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.930 align:middle line:84%
In this way, a
Transfiguration icon

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
is the same as a computer
icon we're all familiar with

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and a highway sign.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:84%
It's concentrated
information that

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes or points to
something beyond itself.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So here's a screen
shot of my desktop.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.695 align:middle line:84%
Here's icons of various images
and programs and documents

00:39:09.695 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:90%
that are on my desktop.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when I click
on one of these images,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.670 align:middle line:84%
something really powerful
is going to happen.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
When I click on
the computer icon,

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:22.300 align:middle line:84%
it opens into a phenomenal
inner world that I can't see

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and hardly can fathom that
brings about enormous potential

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
in something called a program,
a set of coded instructions

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:90%
that enables me to do work.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:36.690 align:middle line:84%
The program's icon is
not the program itself,

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
but it symbolizes it
and opens the way to it.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I propose this is how
the icons work as well.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And for example, when
we see a corporate logo,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.300 align:middle line:84%
such as a blue
apple here, we know

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that if we click
on that logo, it

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:84%
represents thousands
of people who

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:84%
are building some of the most
amazing products on the planet.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
A kind of fun, anecdotal
story here, in 1998

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book
called "Blue Apples"

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
about the mysteries
of Southern France.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:84%
The blue apple is the alchemical
symbol for the impossible.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:13.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist until you think
of it, until you imagine it.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Then you can make it so.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I knew that the
Beatles and Apple Computer

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:84%
were in a huge
lawsuit over control

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.660 align:middle line:84%
of the icon of the
apple for an instrument

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.990 align:middle line:90%
or a device that can play music.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The Beatles sued
Apple and said, hey,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:84%
you can't use the
apple logo if you're

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.030 align:middle line:84%
going to create a
device that plays music.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.449 align:middle line:84%
And Apple at that
time said, well,

00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:84%
we don't have any plans to get
into the music business, which

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.720 align:middle line:84%
is kind of funny now
considering they've completely

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:90%
taken over the music business.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a letter
to Steve Jobs,

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and I said, dear
Steve, I'm writing

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:90%
a book called "Blue Apples."

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys are really
touchy about the Apple logo.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wanting to make
sure that it's OK for me

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to use this icon
or logo in my book.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.300 align:middle line:84%
A couple weeks later,
I get a letter back

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
from Apple's legal department,
and they say, dear, Mr. Henry,

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:84%
we have no problem with
you using the blue apple

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
in your book and in
your presentations.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.532 align:middle line:84%
Apple's logo, in fact, is
a rainbow-colored apple.

00:41:09.532 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with the blue apple.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't long after that
that I bought a new MacBook,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and I had some
technical difficulty,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and I called their
customer service line.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And the operator at the other
end said, what I want you to do

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is to go up in the left-hand
corner of your screen

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.879 align:middle line:90%
and click on the blue apple.

00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I told him the story
I just told you,

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of
went over his head.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But you get the idea, that
the blue apple does exist.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it represents this
powerful, powerful machine.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And later Apple adopted the
slogan "think different."

00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
message of the icons.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.880 align:middle line:90%
We have to think different.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And if we can imagine it, we can
actually live it and become it.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the subtle but
powerful technology

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.030 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is that
the materials of the image

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.390 align:middle line:84%
become a channel or a bridge,
a gate between two worlds.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, to an
orthodox Christian,

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.240 align:middle line:84%
the images are a
medium through which

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.860 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
Transfiguration moment

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.270 align:middle line:84%
can be channeled like
a two-way mirror,

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and devotees could enter the
cosmic realm through the icon.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when the
icons were made,

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.650 align:middle line:84%
alchemy was the normal way of
interacting with the world.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything was viewed as in
the process of transmutation

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:34.370 align:middle line:84%
or changing into something else,
like the acorn into the oak,

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously unveiling
and being reborn.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything was viewed
as transmutable,

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.220 align:middle line:84%
including the human
body, which was viewed

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.580 align:middle line:84%
as a pupal form of an ascended
spiritual being, usually

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.257 align:middle line:84%
symbolized by a butterfly
but also by the phoenix.

00:42:51.257 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists' quest for
the Philosopher's Stone,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.280 align:middle line:84%
or Arcanum, begins
with the realization

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that everything can be
transformed or transmuted.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts can become things,
lead can become gold,

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and a human can
become a star being.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
explain how this can

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:84%
work to activate
our imagination.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.650 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at here is
actually 12 lines on the screen

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that are projected into
your imagination as a cube,

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.290 align:middle line:84%
in fact a cube that
is three-dimensional.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.836 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is is that
as we look at this cube,

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:28.302 align:middle line:90%
it's flipping back and forth.

00:43:28.302 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
We look at it from
one perspective,

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.446 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we're
looking into it.

00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Then we shift our
perspective, it

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.680 align:middle line:84%
looks like we're looking
down into the cube,

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and a completely
different box appears.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
The idea is is that
everything out here

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is brought to life
in our imagination,

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:90%
just like this cube.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be my remote control,
the television you're watching,

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:50.730 align:middle line:84%
the chair you're sitting
on, everything out here

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is brought to life
in our imagination,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and we always have
a choice in how

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.590 align:middle line:84%
we're going to view
things out here.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:84%
If we look at it from
this perspective,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
let's label this way
fear, and let's look at it

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:90%
this way and label it love.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:84%
These are the two choices
that we make millions of times

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Every time we look at any
person, place, or thing,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.910 align:middle line:84%
we're deciding if we're going
to put love into the situation

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.770 align:middle line:90%
person, place, or thing or fear.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And depending upon what we
project, the Golden Rule says,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.100 align:middle line:90%
is what we're going to get back.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that if we can
project love into our world,

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.140 align:middle line:84%
it's going to create a better
frequency for us, a better

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:84%
But also, it holds open a
very powerful promise as well,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and that is is that if we
can focus on love, then

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.060 align:middle line:84%
our 3D world becomes
the inner core

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:84%
of a multi-dimensional
world, symbolized

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:48.890 align:middle line:84%
by the tesseract, where now we
can interact with beings coming

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and going from other
dimensions as well as energies

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.040 align:middle line:90%
from those other dimensions.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
an important key

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:84%
to how we open up to the
divine energy of the icons.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:84%
This alchemical mindset was
adopted by the icon makers,

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.650 align:middle line:84%
especially of the
14th to 17th century.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And these images were
designed not to just

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.160 align:middle line:84%
help early Christians to teach
about the Transfiguration

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.850 align:middle line:84%
through pretty pictures,
but, more importantly,

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:19.770 align:middle line:84%
to encourage them to reshape
their lives in accordance

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.620 align:middle line:84%
with the hope or expectation
of transforming into light,

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.960 align:middle line:84%
something that our
culture is beginning

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to support and embrace.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So that is the value
of these images,

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and, strange as it may
sound to our sensibilities,

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.970 align:middle line:84%
this is how devotees
used icons to do

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:84%
the great work, the
alchemy of the soul.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So in closing, let's
just think about this,

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.280 align:middle line:84%
that through contemplation,
meditation, and reflection

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.530 align:middle line:84%
on these icons, we can begin
to reflect the divine light

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and love experienced by Jesus
in our lives and in our world.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:07.090 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, in this segment
of "Beyond the Veil,"

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Clare's going to show us how
other ancient cultures tapped

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.270 align:middle line:84%
the power of sacred
images for transformation.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Early Christians were
divine alchemists who adopted

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:26.290 align:middle line:84%
the concept that the icon
stood in for an angel or deity.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Worshippers prayed in front
of panel icon in their homes

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:90%
as well as in their churches.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:84%
They were taught that the icon
was a door between this world

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and the world of spirit.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:84%
In this segment of
"Beyond the Veil,"

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:47.005 align:middle line:84%
we will see how this belief
is shared by other traditions.

00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Let us begin with the Egyptians.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:59.080 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.280 align:middle line:84%
The idea that a viewer
can interact energetically

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:90%
with an image begins in Egypt.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Mouthwatering scenes
on the temple walls

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.480 align:middle line:84%
were magically
active in two ways.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to make
permanent the action shown

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:20.210 align:middle line:90%
being performed.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.440 align:middle line:84%
If the pharaoh offered a
loaf of bread to Osiris,

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that loaf of bread
would continue

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to be presented so long as
the representation belonged

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:84%
in this world and in
the world of the gods.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if one stood
before a figure of a god

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and uttered his name, a
portion of the divine spirit

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.440 align:middle line:84%
would animate the stone,
and the deity's attention

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.440 align:middle line:84%
would be upon the
speaker, upon his actions,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and upon the hidden
thoughts of his heart.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The idea was cut and pasted
into the "Corpus Hermeticum,"

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the book of Arcanum attributed
to the Egyptian god Thoth

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and adopted by
earlier Christians.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:84%
The image itself will
show you the way.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.480 align:middle line:10%
So says the "Corpus Hermeticum."

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.680 align:middle line:10%
The materials of
the image become

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.580 align:middle line:10%
a channel between two worlds.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.440 align:middle line:10%
To an orthodox
Christian, the images

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.440 align:middle line:10%
are a medium through
which the whole

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:30.560 align:middle line:10%
may be approached
and grace channelled,

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.610 align:middle line:10%
like a two-way mirror.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The icon is the real
equivalent to and venerated

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.570 align:middle line:84%
with the same honor
as the gospel.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.000 align:middle line:84%
The one communicates
religious truth

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.900 align:middle line:84%
through words and the
other through visible forms

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and symbols.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Both equally are
modes of revelation.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The Hesychasts held that
through prayer and meditation

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:84%
believers could actually come
to perceive the same divine

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:11.240 align:middle line:84%
light that shone around Jesus
during his Transfiguration.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Meditating on images of Jesus
putting on this robe of light

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.780 align:middle line:84%
actually helps us to
put it on, ourselves.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Icons make new pathways in
our lives and in our brains.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:35.070 align:middle line:10%
In 1995, neuroscientists made
a remarkable breakthrough

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:38.390 align:middle line:10%
when they discovered
mirror neurons.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:43.690 align:middle line:84%
A mirror neuron fires when an
animal both performs an action

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and when the animal observes
the same action performed

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:50.200 align:middle line:90%
by another animal.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the neuron mirrors the
behavior of another animal

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:59.970 align:middle line:84%
as though the observer were
itself performing the action.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Those neurons have been
directly observed in primates

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:08.855 align:middle line:84%
and are believed to exist
in humans and in some birds.

00:50:08.855 --> 00:50:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at UCLA found
that mirror neuron cells

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:84%
in the human anterior
cingulate, which normally

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.460 align:middle line:84%
fire when you poke the
patient with a needle,

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.440 align:middle line:84%
also known as pain
neurons, will also

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.820 align:middle line:84%
fire when the patient watches
another patient being poked.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.780 align:middle line:10%
The mirror neurons,
it would seem,

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:10%
dissolve the barrier
between self and others.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:46.870 align:middle line:10%
Neuroscientist V S
Ramachandran believes

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:51.640 align:middle line:10%
mirror neurons are hardwired
for imitation learning.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:10%
This is the driving force
behind the great leap forward

00:50:56.370 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:10%
in human evolution,
so he believes.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Because we can mirror
one another's actions,

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.190 align:middle line:10%
we actually become them.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:11.050 align:middle line:10%
Stretched to its
limit, this says

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:10%
if we mirror Jesus'
Transfiguration

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:10%
through the icons, we can
duplicate his transformation.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.940 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Mario Martinez has shown
that a woman in California

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:30.770 align:middle line:10%
exhibited the stigmata marks
after obsessively reading

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:10%
about the crucifixion.

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The medieval stigmatics
showed wounds

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:40.520 align:middle line:84%
on the palm of their hands
because all the paintings,

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.440 align:middle line:84%
which were based on
cultural beliefs,

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:48.050 align:middle line:84%
showed Jesus'
wounds on the palm.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Then science showed that
Roman crucifixion specialists

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:57.110 align:middle line:10%
bypassed the main artery
and hit a nerve in the wrist

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:02.540 align:middle line:10%
to ensure maximum agony
that lasted for days.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:06.040 align:middle line:84%
More recent stigmatics
show the wounds

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.635 align:middle line:84%
in the wrist because
of cultural beliefs.

00:52:08.635 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.610 align:middle line:10%
We know from research
in psychoneuroimmunology

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:21.190 align:middle line:10%
that feelings of helplessness
weaken immune function,

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:26.090 align:middle line:10%
but that a sense of
empowerment strengthens it.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Redefining how we describe
events with labels that promote

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:10%
helplessness to those
that trigger empowerment

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:40.830 align:middle line:10%
can take a fearful reaction
and inspire an ordinary person

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:45.140 align:middle line:10%
to perform extraordinary deeds.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:53.520 align:middle line:10%
As Dr. Martinez says, where the
mind goes, the biology follows.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at the case of
St. Catherine of Siena.

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:10%


00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.830 align:middle line:10%
"I saw our Lord
fastened upon the cross,

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:06.760 align:middle line:10%
coming down towards
me and surrounding me

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:10%
with a marvellous light.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Then there came down from the
holes of his blessed wounds

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:84%
five bloody beams,
which were directed

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.370 align:middle line:84%
towards the same
parts of my body,

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:26.220 align:middle line:84%
to my hands, feet,
and my heart."

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:31.010 align:middle line:84%
This was how, according to
legend, St. Catherine of Siena

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:37.590 align:middle line:84%
described receiving the stigmata
wounds of Jesus upon the cross.

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:40.670 align:middle line:90%
She was praying before an icon.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The image itself transmitted
the marks as beams of light

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.360 align:middle line:90%
reflected in her body.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Manetti's painting here
shows Catherine with her lily

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.620 align:middle line:84%
by her side in an
ecstatic trance, supported

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.960 align:middle line:90%
by a sister nun.

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Beccafumi also shows Catherine
receiving the stigmata

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.726 align:middle line:10%
from a beaming image
of the crucifix.

00:54:08.726 --> 00:54:11.540 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Martinez's theory
of biocognition

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:19.920 align:middle line:84%
says we have a personal
bioinformational field which

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:84%
has horizons that
can be expanded.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:30.090 align:middle line:84%
If you expand by interacting
with the horizons of Christ,

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:84%
then you will identify with
his suffering or his love.

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.760 align:middle line:84%
If it is with suffering--
and this is very rare--

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:44.760 align:middle line:84%
you may experience the
occurrence of stigmata.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.660 align:middle line:84%
If you identify with
the path of love,

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you experience healing
or special abilities

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to do things or just
convey a sense of love.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Taken to the extreme,
through this process

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
you could transfigure
into a cosmic being.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:13.420 align:middle line:10%
It could be as simple as
monkey see, monkey do.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:10%
According to
Hindu-Buddhist thought,

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:22.880 align:middle line:10%
all that we behold around
us is maya or illusion.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.210 align:middle line:84%
One means of transcending
this illusion

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:30.930 align:middle line:84%
is named Ekagrata, in
the yogic tradition,

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:37.970 align:middle line:84%
a one-pointedness meditation
on sacred images or objects.

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:41.920 align:middle line:10%
When he places himself
before a sacred image,

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.040 align:middle line:10%
the task of the Hindu
devotee is to recognize

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:50.080 align:middle line:10%
the illusory division
between worshiper

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:58.540 align:middle line:10%
and the worshipped, himself and
his god and to transcend it.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:04.300 align:middle line:10%
The Buddha image is the
most adorned form of purity,

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:07.940 align:middle line:10%
be it carved or painted.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:10%
As the Buddha is displayed
in golden brilliance, made

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:10%
magnificent by all
his actions, his face

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:19.720 align:middle line:10%
emanates only compassion.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:25.040 align:middle line:84%
This is achieved in
a moment of samadi.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.940 align:middle line:84%
When the image and the
beholding consciousness unite,

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:34.240 align:middle line:84%
writes Heinrich Zimmer, the goal
of sacred ritual is reached.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The believer experiences
himself as divine.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.280 align:middle line:10%
As the "Corpus Hermeticum"
says, the image

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.460 align:middle line:10%
itself will show you the way.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:50.395 align:middle line:84%
We can indeed enter
through the image.

00:56:50.395 --> 00:56:53.030 align:middle line:90%
