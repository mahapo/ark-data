00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello,
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.280 align:middle line:84%
In November 2011, I was
leading an ascension conference

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.060 align:middle line:90%
in Tempe, Arizona.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:84%
During the weekend I presented
my new and original work

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
on the rainbow body of light,
and the ascension symbolism

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and art in the dome
of the US Capitol.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The existence of the symbolism
in the most powerful building

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in the world is an
amazing disclosure.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it,
but that presentation

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
was also a gateway for
me to an immense soul

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
awakening, which I will
share with you momentarily.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm still amazed
by this connection

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and how beautifully
synchronistic

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
our universe really is.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
First, a bit of background about
the rainbow body and the soul

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:90%
ascension secrets of US Capitol.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into
deep detail here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I just want to set up the
back story for the revelation

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're interested in seeing
more, as I hope you will be,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
please view our Arcanum
episode that Clare and I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:84%
did on the subject, the
Ascension of George Washington.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, it
will blow your mind.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:10%
My interest in the ascension
symbolism in the US Capitol

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:10%
dome began back in 2008
when my friend Dr. Mark

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Gray, who became my co-author
of my book, "Freedom's Gate,"

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:10%
and I were the first
to decode and connect

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:10%
the symbolism of the US
Capitol to the ascension

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:10%
mysteries of the past.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Our collaboration
began in Philadelphia.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
During a presentation,
Dr. Gray nearly

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
came out of this
chair with excitement

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
when I showed photos of the
interior of the Capitol dome

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
with George Washington on
the other end of a star gate,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
or what I interpreted as a star
gate, composed of 72 stars.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
The Fresco in the
eye of the dome

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
called The Apotheosis
of George Washington

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is a masterpiece about chemical
and ascension symbolism,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
about human transformation
into ascended beings.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what the word
apotheosis means.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
It means to raise from a
human state to a divine state.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.705 align:middle line:84%
Painted by the Italian
immigrant Constantino Brumidi

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
and completed in
1865, Washington

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed as an ascended
or divine being who

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
has gone through
a gate of 72 stars

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and is now enthroned on a
rainbow in a heavenly scene.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the word
apotheosis means

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
to raise from the human
realm of the divine,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:90%
and it means to ascend.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:10%
This is why we refer to the US
capital as an ascension dome.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll always remember Dr. Gray
at that presentation saying,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
are you saying the dome of
the US Capitol is a star gate

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and George Washington
has gone through it?

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I said.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.635 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
this symbolism shows.

00:02:55.635 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
The US Capitol dome is
every bit as profound

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
as the ascension
domes we'd find around

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
the world that encode the
secrets of human transformation

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
into light beings and soul
travel through portals.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
These domes are gateways.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:90%
They are divine conduits.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
From Jerusalem's Church
of the Holy Sepulchre,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus is believed
to have ascended,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
the Dome of the Rock, where
the Ark of the Covenant

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
was placed, to Istanbul's Chora
Church, and the fabulous Hagia

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Sophia, to Siena in Italy.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
We find these incredible
domes around the world

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.565 align:middle line:84%
that are loaded with
the secrets of ascension

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:38.875 align:middle line:90%
hidden in plain sight.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:84%
But to me, the US Capitol
dome is the most profound.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
In 2009, Dan Brown's
eagerly anticipated book,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
"The Lost Symbol,"
set in Washington, DC,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:90%
focused on this dome.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
is that Dan Brown

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
had his fictional character,
Dr. Robert Langdon, precisely

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
duplicate my experiences
in the US Capitol

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
as I describe them in my video,
The American Right, which

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
included my early research
on the Capitol dome.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:84%
During my many research
trips to the Capitol,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I would lay on the center
of the rotunda's floor

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and visualize the
dome as a star gate.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
And I began to realize
that the dome is actually

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
a model of our pineal
gland, the soul's gateway.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Dan Brown actually
had Robert Langdon

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
do the same thing in "The
Lost Symbol," even describing

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
the dome is like
the pineal gland

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.882 align:middle line:84%
and seeing it open
like a star gate.

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this could be
one of the greatest

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
literary synchronicities
of all time.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It certainly lead
people to start

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
saying I was the real
life Dr. Robert Langdon.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Not so sure about that, but
it is kind of flattering.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
To me, Constantino
Brumidi was crystal clear

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that he believed
George Washington had

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:90%
attained a Christ-like status.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we
showed this comparison,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Gray and I saw
utter astonishment

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
on the faces of the
experts at the Architect

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Capitol's office.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:84%
How come we haven't seen
this before, they said.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
They had never thought to
put Washington on a rainbow

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
beside Christ as an ascended
being on the rainbow.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We took it one
step further and we

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
showed that this
portrayal matched

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
not only the
Christian depictions

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
of the ascended
Christ on a rainbow,

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:84%
but also the Tibetan depictions
of the rainbow body of light.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
observation

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
that had never been made
before, and opened up

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.130 align:middle line:84%
new territory in the study
of the Capitol's symbolism.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I consider it one of my
most important contributions

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to the study of the
ascension mysteries.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the people
at the Capitol

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
know there are unsolved
mysteries about this temple

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
building.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this is one reason why
we given such wide latitude

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:84%
at the Capitol to prowl
around looking for clues.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
They would only
let us go so far.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We encountered
resistance on a couple

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
of really key discoveries, which
they asked us not to publish.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
To me, the most astonishing
code symbol in the Capitol

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
is not just that
George Washington

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:84%
is shown on a rainbow
in the celestial realms

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
as an ascended
being, but that he

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by 13 maidens
with stars on their heads.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
These are celestial beings.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're in
the Capitol, guides

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that these
13 maidens represent the 13

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
original colonies.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:90%
But I say, hold on.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
This is a heavenly scene.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, my answer is
that the Tibetans

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
teach that the rainbow body
practice is taught in 13 star

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.940 align:middle line:90%
systems, including our own.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I began to wonder,
is it possible

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that the 13 celestial maidens
around George Washington

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
represent the 13 star
systems, or star colonies,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
of which our earth
and soul are part of?

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
If so, think of
the ramifications

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%
of this disclosure.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Do souls really come and go
between these star systems

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
via a system of star gates
and wormholes as I proposed?

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Does the US
government know this?

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Was the founder of the nation
shown the secrets of ascension?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this why he's portrayed
as a resurrected human

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Capitol?

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Historically,
Washington was revered

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
as an ordinary man who
was able to accomplish

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary, even
spiritual extraordinary when he

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:84%
led the first Americans to
freedom and the founding

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
of a new nation
dedicated to freedom

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and the liberty
of the individual.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
What many Americans and people
around the world don't realize

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is that the Freemasons eulogized
George Washington as Enoch, one

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.850 align:middle line:90%
of the first humans to ascend.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
In the story, Enoch
was taken to heaven

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
by the Archangel
Michael, who anointed him

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
with an oil that dissolved
his body into rainbow light.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Once Enoch attained
this light being status,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
he gained the ability to
fluidly morph or phase

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
between his light body
state and flesh and blood.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Are the Freemasons
actually implying

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:84%
that George Washington was the
reincarnated soul of Enoch?

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at some evidence.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Depictions I found in
museums in Philadelphia

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and New York of Washington
after his death stunningly

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
portrayed him ascending
into heaven just

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.110 align:middle line:90%
like the story of Enoch.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.309 align:middle line:84%
This engraving by J.J.
Barralet from 1800

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.259 align:middle line:84%
is based on a sermon delivered
after Washington's death

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:90%
equating Washington to Enoch.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, did the Freemasons
and ordinary Americans

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
of the early 1800s
actually believe

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that George Washington was
a reincarnation of Enoch

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and that he too ascended?

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Think about this possibility
and what it actually means.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
In this 1800 Apotheosis
of Washington,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
we see an angel placing
the wreath of immortality

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:90%
on Washington's head.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
In this example, Washington is
raised like Jesus from the tomb

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
upon a shaft of light by the
spiritual and temporal genius

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:90%
assisted by immortality.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And he ascends through a
sun gate or a star gate.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:84%
In this final example, we
see Washington as a Freemason

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
standing on a
checkerboard, the symbol

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of the matrix of earth life.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
A ladder extends from
his right shoulder.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The latter extends into
a rainbow hole in heaven,

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
or a rip in the
fabric of space time.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
To me, this shows
Washington's dissolution

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
into pure energy and his
attainment of the rainbow light

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's suggested,
it's pretty obvious

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that early Americans believe
something extraordinary

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:84%
about George Washington
that we have either

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.350 align:middle line:90%
dismissed or forgotten.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They believed George
Washington was an awakened soul

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and that he ascended.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Or at least they intended
for him to ascend.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So did he attain the rainbow
light body as I propose?

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Is he now a resident of the
divine throne, like Enoch?

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what does that mean
for the founding of America?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if, like
the original Jesus,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Washington has been white
washed by future generations,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:90%
and he's become lost.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But can you imagine if
imagery such as this

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:84%
were attached to any
current era president?

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a nation led
by conscious ascenders,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
we seem to have become a nation
led by unconscious descenders

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
who are apparently leading
us away from us spiritually

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
or soul-based nation into a
nation devoid of anything that

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:90%
smacks of spirituality.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But America was founded upon the
separation of church and state.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
However, we are creating
a world of no religion

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and no spirituality
some believe.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
we're also risking

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:90%
creating a world with no soul.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:90%
But nations do have souls.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:84%
There are such things
as soul groups.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And the soul of these groups
gets in the DNA of the people,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:90%
in its mindset.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And today some
people are searching

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:90%
for the American soul.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:90%
They wonder, where has it gone?

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Remember, America was founded
as a psychological space where

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:84%
souls from all over
the world would

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
be free for the first
time in the history

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
of the tyranny of a
king or the limitations

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
of a pope or a priest, to attain
freedom and enlightenment.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The concept of soul
liberty is you is

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:90%
the unique keystone to America.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea is
that in matters

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
of religion and
spirituality, each person

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:84%
has the liberty and
freedom to choose

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
what his or her conscious
were soul dictates is right,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and is only truly accountable
to God for their decisions.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
This is an inalienable
right bestowed on the soul

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:84%
by our creator God, and
it cannot be taken away.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:84%
This concept is
based on the belief

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that God created our
souls and we therefore

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.510 align:middle line:90%
are only answerable to God.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But throughout history,
the state and church

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
has regarded itself as the
ruler of the human soul.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Billions upon billions of souls
that have incarnated on Earth

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
have been subjects of an earthly
hierarchy that has really

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.000 align:middle line:84%
zero interest in allowing
the individual soul to fully

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
display its abilities or,
especially, to ascend.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
At least not without
their permission.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But the founding
fathers of America

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:90%
challenged this relationship.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Bewildered, many of the
ancestors of America's founders

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:84%
left their home in
England and elsewhere

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and made a perilous journey
across a great divide,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.390 align:middle line:90%
across an ocean.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, across
a great ideological divide.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Buddha,
they no longer

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.610 align:middle line:90%
wish to maintain an illusion.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They set out to discover the
basic truth about our soul.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And they founded
religious sects.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
They identified themselves as
Puritans, Quakers, Shakers,

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
seekers, ranchers, soul
sleepers, diggers, levelers,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.236 align:middle line:90%
earth shakers.

00:13:37.236 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:90%
These were the names.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:84%
They sound like
gangs but these are

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:90%
spiritually motivated people.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They came to America to
try a holy experiment.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
They came to the New World to
get the king off their back

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and to abolish the state's
authority on their soul.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
This American soul experiment
sought to answer the question,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:90%
what can people do?

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
What can a soul accomplish with
no pope, priest, politician

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
telling us what is
possible for us?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And this began a new journey, a
new chapter for the human soul.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And America became more
than just a sacred ideal.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
It became a sacred place.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I emphasize that for
the first time in history,

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
the founding fathers began with
the premise of the sovereignty

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:90%
of the individual soul.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:90%
The sovereignty of the soul.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
each soul possesses

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
certain inalienable
and individual rights.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:84%
which they equated
with wholeness.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this equates with
holiness and righteousness.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And we know we are fully whole,
holy, and complete when we've

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:90%
attained our rainbow body.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And we attain this, again,
not out of ego gratification,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
but because it's the only way
to create a truly just society,

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:90%
a soul-based society.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And this ideal speaks directly
to why George Washington

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed in his
rainbow light body

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
in the dome of the US Capitol.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the founding
fathers were

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:84%
able to create a practical
document, the Bill of Rights,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and a system of government that
kept the powers of government

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
in check, they actually
created an environment

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in which the soul
could thrive again

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:90%
for the first time in history.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate manifestation
of soul liberty

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.012 align:middle line:90%
is enlightenment or ascension.

00:15:41.012 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, we therefore
should really not

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
be so surprised that
Constantino Brumidi

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
painted the savior of America
as an enlightened being.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In our world, in our time, we
each have an opportunity never

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:90%
before given to so many people.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Our freedom of choice,
movement, and thought

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
gives our soul
the tools it needs

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to gather knowledge of
ascension and the freedom

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to practice and achieve it.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Today one can decide to
aim their soul at its most

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
elevated level, and at
the press of a computer

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
button have access to
everything one needs

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:90%
to achieve the state of being.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
From traveling to
a distant country

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to accessing any
sacred text, we're

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.419 align:middle line:84%
connecting with any guru
or spiritual teacher.

00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Without wishing to
sound patronizing,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
it is a fact that
there has never

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
existed a Gaia TV before in
human history, in which all

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:84%
the greatest spiritual and
higher consciousness teachings

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
are together in one place
at the click of a button.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
No other civilization in human
history can make this claim.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe not
since the destruction

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of the Library of Alexandria
in Egypt in 280 AD.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So this means we freely do live
during an extraordinary time.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a
propaganda talk for America.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The point I'm making is that
no other government has ever

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
founded, was ever
founded, with the express

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.876 align:middle line:90%
purpose of freeing the soul.

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:12.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit more
than ironic, isn't it,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that these men
also owned slaves.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So now onto my
promised revelation.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
After my presentation
in Tempe, a gentleman

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
introduced himself as a
long time practitioner

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan great
perfection, or the rainbow

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
body of light teaching.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He congratulated me on the
connections and discoveries

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:90%
that I had made in my progress.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said he had
something to give me

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and he'd bring it
to me the next day.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day he
arrived with this image.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
From the very first
time I saw this image,

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I was simply awestruck
and astounded.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Path of
Calm Abiding, he said.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And it shows an initiate
following a winding path

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that resembles a stairway to
a cosmic conduit, a rainbow

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
bridge.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What we see here is the soul
symbolized by a gray elephant,

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.440 align:middle line:84%
begins at the bottom
of the journey

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and passes through trials as it
makes its ascent to the throne.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:84%
As it reaches the
higher and higher levels

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.880 align:middle line:84%
on this stairway of
light, the gray elephant

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:90%
begins to turn pink.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that as one
ascends the spiral pathway,

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
one gains more and more purity.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
We become more compassionate.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And once the soul reaches
the rainbow bridge,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%
it can freely come and go
from the eternal world.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
We can phase between
the celestial flesh

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and earthly flesh,
just like Enoch.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And the two white
elephants that we

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
see meeting one another
on the rainbow bridge

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
symbolize the ability
of the ascendant's soul

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to come and go from the pure
land to the earth plain.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Until finally, across
the rainbow bridge,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
we see the purified soul
in the rainbow room.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Now you've already probably
made this connection

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that this scene
precisely matches

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Christian images of Christ
enthroned on a rainbow throne.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.680 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Hebrews
tells us that Sion

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is the name of the celestial
holy city of the living

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:90%
God, the heavenly Jerusalem.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And our arrival there
marks our acceptance

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
into an innumerable
company of angels

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:90%
and just humans made perfect.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
But you are come to
Mount Sion, says Hebrews,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:84%
into the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and to an innumerable
company of angels

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
to the Church of the
Firstborn, whose names

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:90%
are written in heaven.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.015 align:middle line:84%
This is an
extraordinary statement

00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that heaven is
populated by a group of humans

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
who have achieved perfection.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Hebrews continues
saying, you have

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:84%
come to God, the judge of all,
to the spirits of the just

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:90%
or righteous made perfect.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, we are
being told that Sion

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.410 align:middle line:10%
is a spiritual place
beyond the physical realm,

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and that Sion's godly
inhabitants are actually

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:10%
transformed or ascending humans,
just humans make perfect,

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:10%
who live in the companies of
angels in the heavenly city.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the same as the
Buddhist concept of Nirvana,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and it also matches the
story of the Apotheosis

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of George Washington
in the US Capitol dome.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.295 align:middle line:84%
To me, this symbolism seals
the link between the star gate

00:20:44.295 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
or wormhole in the dome of the
Capitol and the Tibetan rainbow

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
body tradition, and
the Christian concept

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Resurrection
or glory body.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha could also
be George Washington.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happened for me
is that my introduction

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
to and further exploration of
the Native American beliefs

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:84%
about the path of souls was
still a couple of years away.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But once I learned
about it, I readily

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.600 align:middle line:84%
recognized the winding
waterway or pathway

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
upon which the soul acsends
in these Path of Calm Abiding

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
images is the Milky
Way, and that this

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is the Buddhist version of the
Native American path of souls

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:90%
idea.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So I began seeking other images
that portrayed this path, which

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
is also called Shamatha.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
In this Bhutanese painted
thanka of the Jataka tales

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
from the 18th or 19th
century from Bhutan,

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
we see the same
layer cake effect

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
with levels of reality linked
by rainbow bridges or divine

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
conduits until finally,
on the higher level

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
we see the white
elephant and a serpent,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and finally, the
enthroned Buddha.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly, once again,
what we see in Christian art.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Now Buddhists would
say that we already

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:90%
have attained our ascension.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.405 align:middle line:84%
We only need to realize it and
by undoing the bewildering mind

00:22:11.405 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and focusing on peace.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Shamatha meditation
is how they do this.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.215 align:middle line:84%
Shamatha, or peacefully abiding,
is a very extraordinary word.

00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:90%
The root sham means peace.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
vowels are considered

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to be interchangeable
in ancient words.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So swapping an I or an
E here or there reveals

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:90%
some very fascinating links.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Shama, for example, is
the root of shambala,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the realm of the immortals,
the Shining Ones.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
Tibetan for Shamatha

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is shyine which looks
like shine in English.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Sham or sham is the
Arabic name for the sun.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
It's found in the Hebrew
shamir, which rings of shimmer.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the name of the
miraculous stone cutter

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:90%
used to build Solomon's Temple.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Sham is found in Baal
Shemit, a classification

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish priests who
knew the name of the Lord.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Bit Shimti is the name of the
house where the wind or soul

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
was breathed into the first
human, Adapa, in the Sumerian

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.285 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Ni Shemit is the name of the
golden soul boat of Osiris.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Then finally, there's the word
shaman, or shaman, or soul

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
healer.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of powerful words
revolving around the word sham

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that are all congruent with the
ideals of peace and ascension.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Funny isn't it, that all these
words contain the word sham?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Shamatha is a practice
that anyone can do.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It really is a
science of the mind.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is be mindful
and set your heart's power

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:90%
of intention on peace.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And this links you with what
I call the heart's ascension

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.462 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:24:06.462 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The Shamatha thankas
are meant, actually,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to be open eye meditations that
guide our mind into stillness.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Peacefully abiding means
we are at peace or feeling

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%
whole and complete.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
We know we are at
that ultimate peace

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
when the rainbow
bridge opens before us.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
These illustrations
actually function

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in a manner similar
to a cosmogram

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
or a mandala, a Sanskrit word
meaning circle and wholeness.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Mandalas are designed to help
us to go full circle as souls.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:10%
Mandalas are concentric
diagrams or holy patterns that

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:10%
represent a universe or
cosmos metaphysically

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:10%
and symbolically.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They are used as
meditation aids.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Hindus and Buddhists
use mandalas

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to create imaginary
palaces or thrones

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to focus the spiritual attention
of aspirants and adepts.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.350 align:middle line:90%
They are divine conduits.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:84%
The center point in the
circle is called the bindu.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The mandala binds the
aspirant to the divine.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And the bindu or bindu is
thought of as a seed, a sperm,

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
a drop, or a starting
point around which

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual essence is drawn.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:10%
As the devotee draws in
the essence energies,

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:10%
their own energies begin to
bind with the spiritual essence

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:10%
and expand.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The word mandala is derived
from manda, or essence, and la,

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:90%
or container.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, it is a container
of this essence,

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and it is designed
to help our body

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to become a container for
this essence, as well.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
An additional purpose
of the mandala

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
is significant to our study.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:84%
That is because mandalas
symbolize the universe.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
They are an active
form of meditation

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:84%
that establish sacred
space, a pure Buddha

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
realm, and the abode of fully
realized beings or deities

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
where our ascended
higher self dwells.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Just having a mandala
in our presence

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
establishes sacred space.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
The sacred space of the mandala
is actually viewed as separate

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
from ordinary or profane
reality, the normal world.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And by visualizing pure
lands or Buddha realms,

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
one learns to
dwell in that place

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and experience oneself
as a pure being.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists teach that meditating
on the symbols of the mandala

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
opens one to progressively
deeper levels

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious until
the meditator experiences

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
a mystical sense of oneness
with the divine realm.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The mandala represents
all the levels

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of energy of the perfect
spiritual body working

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
in balance by allowing our mind
to recognize that wholeness

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and perfection is
our original state,

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is a state
of pure peace.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Here's another example of a
golden Dorje from the Rubin

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Museum.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an exploding
star or a wormhole to me.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The path of calm abiding images
that we've been exploring

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.606 align:middle line:90%
had much more to show me.

00:27:27.606 --> 00:27:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Soon after learning
about them, I

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
became transfixed by a
series of unusual 15th

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to 17th century
Russian Last Judgment

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
icons, which depict a
serpent ladder linking

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Earth with Jesus's
cosmic throne, or Sion.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The icon shown here features
the extraordinary symbolism

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of this style of Last
Judgment iconography.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
What we see are five
horizontal zones

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:84%
with a central access,
a tree or a pillar,

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
around which climbs a serpentine
rope, chain, or rosary of orbs.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Each zone represents a level
of light, or perhaps vibration.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.745 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. David Goldfrank notes
in his article, A Problem

00:28:12.745 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
of Last Judgment Iconography,
the snake suddenly

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
appeared without warning
in late medieval Ukrainian

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and Russian Last
Judgment iconography.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knows
where it came from.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It usually has 20 or
more rings representing

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:84%
what Goldfrank calls stellar
toll booths through which

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:90%
the soul must pass after death.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:10%
The resurrected Jesus sits on
an arching bow in a blue sphere

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:10%
in the higher zones.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Stellar toll booth.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I love it when academics
speak like this.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I think
they'd find great illumination

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
if instead of using
the word toll booth,

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:84%
they use the word
star gate instead,

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because this is obviously
what's being described here.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And further, the serpent
symbolizes the cosmic conduit,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:84%
just like in the Tibetan images
of the Path of Calm Abiding.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:10%
Is this the source
of this imagery?

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Or does it come
from somewhere else?

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Goldfrank tells us that
the rings on the serpent

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
represent the torments the
human soul must go through

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to return to
the kingdom of heaven.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
In my view, this serpent rope
is a sort of umbilical cord

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that can be thought of
as the spiritual ladder,

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:90%
or stairway to heaven.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It literally is the
star gate to God.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It represents the soul's
path to ascension.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:84%
In Secret of Sion, I propose
that these cosmic toll booths

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, star gates
that the soul passes through

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:90%
on its way to Sion.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:90%
They're soul gates.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And these images map
the soul's journey home.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at another example.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
In the lowest zone here
on the left hand side,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we see the righteous
souls in line

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:84%
waiting to enter past St. Peter,
who stands at the golden door

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
or tower with
golden gates guarded

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
by a seraph, a celestial
being that dwells normally

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.810 align:middle line:84%
at the throne of God but
has apparently come here

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve these souls.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we see
the ascended Christ

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
is shown enthroned and radiant
at the end of the serpent's

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:84%
mouth, or at the
end of the wormhole.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:84%
He is in heaven, enthroned
upon a sapphire blue orb,

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:84%
ringed with stars and
flanked by Mary and John

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, the two
people who helped him most

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:90%
during his earthly ascension.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
He's also surrounded by
mysterious celestial or star

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.550 align:middle line:84%
beings, who are referred to in
Hebrews as the just humans made

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.460 align:middle line:90%
perfect.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.570 align:middle line:84%
As we notice here,
beneath Jesus is

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:84%
a cross mounted to
a box or an alter

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and attended by two angels,
and other instruments

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.910 align:middle line:84%
of the passion, including
the Spear of Destiny

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:90%
and the rod with a sponge.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.300 align:middle line:84%
In Russia, this
assembly of symbols

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
was called Etimasia, or the
throne of the Second Coming,

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and will be retrieved
and reassembled

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
by the returning Christ at
the time of the Second Coming.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:22.220 align:middle line:84%
The Greek verb hetoimase means
to prepare, or preparation,

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.670 align:middle line:90%
as in the Second Coming.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It's ever present in these
Russian Last Judgment images

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.590 align:middle line:84%
because it will be
deployed at judgment day

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:84%
when the Christ or
messiah returns.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
In my book "The
Judgment Day Device,"

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I propose that this throne is
in fact the fully assembled

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Ark of the Covenant, the throne
chariot or soul transportation

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.560 align:middle line:90%
device.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:84%
When the rod of Aaron, seen
here in the Ark of the Covenant,

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is attached to the
golden box of the Ark

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and the two tablets
are placed on top

00:31:55.070 --> 00:32:01.240 align:middle line:84%
of that rod of enlightenment,
it forms the throne of Christ.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So in my view, the
Tibetan imagery

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is very likely the candidate
for the source of this imagery.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we
are looking at images

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that are designed to assist
the soul in mapping it's

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.980 align:middle line:90%
ascension to the divine realms.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:10%
More fantastically, I can
envision the original source

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:10%
of this imagery as coming
from a divine place

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:10%
elsewhere, deep in the cosmos.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these images
we've looked at,

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:84%
from George Washington on
the rainbow in the US Capitol

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to the Tibetan Path
of Calm Abiding

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:40.020 align:middle line:84%
to the Russian Last
Judgment images

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:43.880 align:middle line:84%
help us to recognize
that our soul ascends

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
via a divine or cosmic conduit
that we today call a wormhole.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:84%
These conduits remind me
a bit of the beanstalk

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Jack ascended to in
the land of the giant

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
after he planted the magic
seeds in the fairytale.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
episode, we're going

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to explore our souls
as sacred star seeds

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and see how this
idea could truly

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:11.120 align:middle line:84%
transform our world into a
truly green civilization.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, be humble,
let your light shine.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.
