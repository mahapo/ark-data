00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
wondered if your soul

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:90%
is from another star system?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever feel like Earth
is not your home planet?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:90%
If so, you may be a star seed.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Star seeds are beings who have
experienced life elsewhere

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:90%
The term sounds really New Agey.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
However, the concept has
a very ancient origin.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
The Stoics of Greece
in the third century BC

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:84%
are credited with
first discussing

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the conception of our soul as
a divine spark, a divine seed,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
seeded from the
stars, a star seed.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.840 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul used the
Stoic imagery of seeds

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to explain the Resurrection
and Ascension of Jesus.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
By taking a look at
these early beliefs,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we will gain greater
understanding

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
of today's ascension
teachings and open our path

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
to new, higher levels.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Seeds, as tiny and
humble as they are,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
are a beautiful and powerful
sacred metaphor for life,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, and the soul.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They are magic, as in the
fabled "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In "Jack and the
Beanstalk," Jack

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
sells his poor mother's cow
for a handful of magical beans.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
This infuriates her,
and she tosses the beans

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:90%
into the garden.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They grow into a thick stalk
that climbs into the sky.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Jack proceeds to
climb the stalk,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
find the land of a giant,
and steal from him.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The giant pursues
Jack, but the boy

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
is able to scurry down
the stalk fast enough

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to chop it down and send
the giant to his death.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of esoteric
meaning packed into this story,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
including the reference
to the giants,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
or Titans, who we
discussed in our episode

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:90%
about the Titan Prometheus.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
The great mythologist and
esotericist Manly P. Hall

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
once gave a lecture about
the esoteric meaning

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:90%
of "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:10%
He wrote, "In the
allegory of the beanstalk,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:10%
Jack is the initiate
climbing towards perfection.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:10%
The beanstalk has
two significances.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:10%
First, it is the
secret doctrine,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.420 align:middle line:10%
which may grow up to its
fullness in a single night

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:10%
if that night be regarded
as the duration of the soul

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:10%
in its mortal state.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:10%
The beanstalk is further
symbolic of the soul itself,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:10%
up which consciousness
must climb

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:10%
to discover the divine sphere
from which it was exiled."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:10%
So this is Manly P. Hall laying
out the early gnostic teaching

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:10%
about the soul's ascension.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
That teaching says the
soul can grow its way home.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:10%
Manly also uses our
magic word-- perfection.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:90%
And this is our soul's goal.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Jack's name is derived from the
biblical name Jacob, or Jacob,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
who famously wrestled
with an angel at a place

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
called Pineal, which
rings of pineal,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
the gland in the
center of the brain

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that some consider
the seat of the soul.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Jacob also scaled the
ladder to heaven at a place

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
called Luz, a Hebrew word
that means an almond tree.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to stories
and fables written

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
in the sacred, secret,
or mystery language,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
trees, ladders,
staircases, and the like

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
often symbolize a spiritual
journey, as well as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
the soul's evolution and
progressive development

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:90%
and unfoldment, or ascension.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the world,
people ascended

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
upon trees, poles,
or pillars of wood,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
rising to the divine source.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.190 align:middle line:84%
These, of course,
start as seeds.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And the seed is our soul.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Jack's magic beans or seeds like
Jacob's almond hold blueprints

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
for life, the
process of renewal,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
and the seeds of our ascension.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish menorah, or tree of
light, exemplifies this pillar.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
It is connected
to the almond tree

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and is known as the
almond tree of light.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
A Jewish midrash says,
"And by the Tree of Life,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the souls of the righteous
are going up and down

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to heaven and from heaven
to the Garden of Eden,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
like a man going up
and down a ladder."

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
This is an obvious reference
to Jacob's Ladder and points

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
to the interchangeability of
the Tree of Life and the ladder

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:90%
symbolism.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They both symbolize the
soul's path to the divine.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
At their most basic
level, the seed

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is the means by which a plant,
tree, or flower reproduces

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Almonds in particular
are an image

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
of radical transformation,
which is why the resurrected

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
or transformed Jesus is shown in
an almond-shaped gate of light,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
a stargate, a
portal, often shown

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:90%
composed of rainbow light.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The gate of light is
actually a mandorla, which

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:90%
is the Italian word for almond.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
The mandorla is
an ancient symbol

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
of two circles coming together,
overlapping one another to form

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:90%
an almond shape in the middle.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%
A symbol is not merely an image.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It is like a door into the
inner world of the soul.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
The circles can represent the
sacred and earthly dimensions,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and they meet in the
middle in our soul.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The Western mandorla,
or soul gate,

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
first appears in
fifth century mosaics

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
decorating the Church of
Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and Mary ride
within a blue mandorla

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
filled with stars, affirming
that this mandorla is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a stargate and containing
other secrets is

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we don't know for
sure where this symbolism came

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's also found in
Buddhism, where it symbolizes

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:90%
a luminous ascension cloud.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And we often find
within this cloud

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
the triple-dot symbol
of the Chintamani.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:90%
The Chintamani.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol for
the light body,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's seen here as the
fruit of the mandorla.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet tradition,
Padmasambhava, the light body

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
guru, is shown in a
mandorla, symbolizing

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow body of light,
the flower of our soul seed.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So, too, is the
king of Shambhala.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
By the sixth
century, the mandorla

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
had become a standard
attribute of Christ

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:84%
in scenes of the
Transfiguration,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in which Christ shows himself
to his apostles, transformed

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
into a celestial appearance,
and the ascension in which

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the resurrected Christ
ascends to heaven, and later

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in other scenes involving the
resurrected, or celestial,

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Christ.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
These are all moments of
transcendence and traveling

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just Jesus
who travels this way.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Mary is also shown in
this vessel of light,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:90%
as is Francis of Assisi.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I could look
at these images all day.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:90%
They have a vibe about them.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the almond
itself is the shape

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of a vibrating string.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
These images are designed to
show the soul at its highest

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Earthly vibration.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And by vibing, or resonating,
with these images,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:90%
we can become it.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous
images of the mandorla,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
vesica piscis, is

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
found on the legendary chalice
well in Glastonbury, England.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
The early Christians used
this symbol as a method

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to describe the coming
together of heaven and Earth,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
the coming together of
the divine and the human.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.415 align:middle line:84%
This, by the way, is the origin
of the Christian fish symbol,

00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:26.188 align:middle line:84%
but most don't realize
the mandorla is actually

00:08:26.188 --> 00:08:27.126 align:middle line:90%
a stargate.

00:08:27.126 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:84%
The seed of life
is a modern name

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:84%
for an ancient geometric
figure and universal symbol

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Drunvalo Melchizedek
is given credit

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
for reviving this ancient
knowledge and symbolism

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and connecting it to
the flower of life.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm often asked
if I have studied

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Drunvalo's work on the
Merkaba, and the answer is no.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I made a conscious
decision long ago

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
to stick with the
original Merkaba

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
teachers, the ancient
Jewish and Egyptian mystics,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
but hope one day to be able
to study Drunvalo's works.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
The name "seed of
life" instantly

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
offers insights and
deeper meaning and purpose

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
into the symbolism, found at
the heart of the pattern called

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:90%
the flower of life.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
There is an entire
cosmology of consciousness

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
encoded into this
singular geometric seed.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
The seed of life consists
of seven overlapping circles

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:90%
with the same diameter.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Six of them are regularly
spaced within the seventh,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
producing a rosette with 18
lens-shaped petals, six smaller

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.250 align:middle line:90%
ones inside the 12 larger ones.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:10%
The seed of life is
formed from a relationship

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:10%
of six circles around one.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.650 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, six
circles will always

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:10%
fit exactly around a seventh
circle of the same size.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And these seven circles
mirror our chakras and also

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
the colors of the rainbow body,
as well as the musical scales.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
This forms a
foundation upon which

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
the infinite fractal nature
of life can be understood

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and the gate of life opened.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
As the seed grows, it
becomes the Tree of Life,

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
or tree upon which the
soul ascends to heaven.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the seed is
a perfect metaphor

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:90%
for the soul and its ascension.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The seed, or
incarnating human soul,

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the spiritual realm
originally and plants itself

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
in the earthly body
of clay, or DNA,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
for the production
of earthly fruit.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:84%
As the saying says, it is by
our fruit that we are known.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
The worry in our present
age is that the soul seed

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:84%
can be planted on Earth but
won't be allowed to fully grow.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Instead, it could rot or wither.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And just as the body needs
food, so, too, does the soul.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It craves wisdom,
especially about

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of its existence.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is why seeds are the
basis of knowledge and wisdom.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
As UCLA scholar Maryanne
Horowitz points out,

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
"Seminaries, from the Greek
seminarium, or seed plot,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
seedbed, or nursery,
are places where

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
people go for spiritual
education in a seminar,

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
where seminal, from
the Latin word seed,

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
ideas are passed
between professor,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
who is a tree of
knowledge, and the student,

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
who is a seed, who is seeking
sapienta, or wisdom, from books

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
that are called leaves."

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
People seek to turn over a new
leaf, or nip things in the bud.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
We go out on a limb
to seek knowledge.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And finally, after
seeking comes seeing.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And when one sees
the seed, we actually

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.060 align:middle line:84%
only see a portion of
what is actually possible

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:90%
or what is actually there.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
But when one learns to see
with the eyes of the soul,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
one can see that all
things are possible.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The soul does not see itself
as a divine spark, by the way.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It sees itself as part
of the universal light.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The soul, our soul seed,
knows it has packed within it

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the ability to morph into
something beyond what

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:90%
is immediately recognized.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of the acorn and
how encoded within it

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:90%
is the plan for the mighty oak.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
The acorn comes into existence,
lives its life cycle,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and then carries its destiny
forward and becomes an oak.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
The acorn has the blueprint
for the towering oak within it,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and the entire tree
was once a tiny acorn

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that could fit in the
palm of your hand.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But which came first,
the acorn or the oak?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We all have an
acorn within us that

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
has a blueprint for
becoming an oak,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
or the light body, that is.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
This is why Jesus is
covered with acorns

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:90%
in this transfiguration scene.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
As I noted, the seed was
the earliest metaphor

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
for the Resurrection
of the body.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
As a seed is
transformed into a body,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
so, too, does our Earthly
body become transformed

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:90%
into our heavenly light bodies.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The blueprint for this
glory body, or light body,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is within our DNA, awaiting the
moment when a mysterious force

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:84%
called the last trump, a
Greek word for vibration,

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.410 align:middle line:84%
awakens it from its sleep,
and it begins scaling heaven.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, this seed is
called the Adamantine nucleus

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of radiant or clear light.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The term Adamantine body
refers to the subtle body,

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:90%
the light body.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's also known as the
vajra body, or diamond body.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, vajra means
compassion in action.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Growing or revealing this
compassionate body of light

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:90%
is the great work of Buddhism.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the seed is
very much like the egg,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic egg,
which is actually

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
the feminine counterpart
to the masculine seed.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The masculinity of
the seed is affirmed

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Greek words that
relate to seeds or sowing--

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:90%
sporos, sperma, sparrow.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.310 align:middle line:84%
According to the Greek
Stoics, the material spiritual

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
spermata, or seeds from
the divine, are within us.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the seed
is a wonderful model

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
for soul growth and
spiritual growth.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Stoicism was popular in
Roman Greece around 200 BC.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The principles of Stoicism
were focused on two things.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
One, how can we lead a
fulfilling or happy life?

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And two, how can we become
better human beings?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They basically said we
have a very short time

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
while we're here, so let's
not sweat the small stuff.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Time is our most precious
resource, and it's finite.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
This provided a sense of urgency
or motivation to their lives.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:90%
So they focused on principles.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
They viewed challenges as fuel
for the fire of a happy life

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and the development
of the light body.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
They focused on humility and
self-awareness of our role

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.070 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they also
emphasized studying

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
the stories of those who have
been successful in attaining

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:90%
the light body.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
The Stoics believed
the whole universe

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:90%
was one living being, one mind.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
The Stoic belief in the
universe as a living being

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and the soul as a seed
or spark of the divine

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:84%
is referred to explicitly
in Virgil's "Aeneid."

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
"Thence, man's
race and the beast

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
and the feathered
creature that flies,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:84%
all wild shapes that are hidden
the gleaming waters beneath.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Each elemental seed has a
fiery force from the skies.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Each its heavenly being that
no dull clay can disguise."

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So what they're saying is that
living things have within them

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
a stellar, or star, seed, which
has a fiery force from heaven.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Virgil believed that
when the soul returns

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to its original fiery
state, it regains its purity

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and becomes godlike.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Stoics were the ones
who really brought forward

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
the idea that we're made
of star stuff, God stuff.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Our soul is a seed.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a thought or a
neuron in the mind of God,

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and it's all a living thing.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Greek word
"conception" refers to an idea

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and to the first stage
of embryonic development

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
when the seed, or sperm,
fertilizes the egg and the soul

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:90%
steps in.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:84%
In a previous episode, we looked
at the Jewish and Christian

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
idea that the soul,
or seed spark,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:84%
enters the womb at the
moment of conception.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Hildegarde's painting shows
this soul, or seed spark,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
descending to the Earthly
realm through a tube of light

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
from the fiery, starry
realm and entering the womb.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist tradition also
used seeds to convey teachings.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:84%
The first line of the
Dhammapada states, "Our life

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
is shaped by our mind.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:90%
We become what we think."

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
The idea, or conception, is
that thoughts are conceptions,

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
are the seeds that give rise to
actions, habits, and character.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our
character is our soul.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Thus, our thoughts,
our conceptions,

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.640 align:middle line:90%
are actually made by the soul.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.862 align:middle line:84%
This is why this Chinese
proverb is so powerful.

00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
"Be careful of your
thoughts, for your thoughts

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:90%
become your words.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Be careful of your words, for
your words become your actions.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Be careful of your
actions, for your actions

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:90%
become your habits.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
"Be careful of your
habits, for your habits

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:90%
become your character.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Be careful of your
character, for your character

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:90%
becomes your destiny."

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The author of this Chinese
proverb is unknown,

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:90%
but it's cosmic.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The seeds of harmful
behaviors lie in the mind.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhists teach that
with awareness and practice,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to dig
up undesirable seeds--

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:84%
jealousy, anger, ignorance--
from our interior garden,

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and we can begin to plant new
seeds for a happier picture.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
They tell us we can do this by
practicing the six paramita,

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:84%
or the six perfections,
which are generosity,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
giving of oneself,
ethics, patience,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
joyful effort, meditation,
and transcendental wisdom.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
There's our magic
word again, isn't it?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Perfection.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
These six practices
of perfection

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
are designed to complete
us and to make us

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
like the immortal holy
ones, or Bodhisattvas,

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and the perfected ones of
the rainbow body teaching.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The promise is that with
the right actions, over time

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
your Buddha nature, your
enlightened consciousness,

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
expresses itself more fully,
like a blossoming lotus.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:84%
This aspect of interior knowing,
which goes by many names--

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness,
Messiah, Atma, et

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
cetera-- is lined within
us like a seed in wait,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.900 align:middle line:90%
like a seed in the ground.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual practice
nurtures that seed

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and causes it to
emerge and blossom.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems that part of the
destiny of our generation

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of humanity is to bring
the seed-soul metaphor back

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:90%
into our consciousness.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Today some fear we have
lost our connection

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to the life-giving
properties of seeds

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:84%
as a byproduct of our
highly industrialized

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and materialistic culture.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
According to author and Sufi
mystic Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
we have not only lost the
sacred dimension of the seeds,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
but a lived connection to
the sacred Earth, to Gaia.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:84%
In "Sacred Seed," a
collection of essays

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
by religious leaders about the
role of seeds in human life,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
he asks, "How can
life have real meaning

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
if we have no connection
to a sacred Earth?"

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The agricultural practices of
genetically modifying crops

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and prioritizing monocultures
over multi-crop farming

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
have made biodiversity plummet
in many parts of the world.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Environmental activists
but Vandana Shiva

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
wrote, "India once had
200,000 rice varieties

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:90%
before monocultures took hold."

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
She continue, "Today the country
grows just eight globally

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:90%
traded strains of rice."

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
"When seed is living and
regenerative and diverse,

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
it feeds the pollinators,
the soil organisms,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and the animals, including
humans," Shiva writes.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.920 align:middle line:84%
"When seed is
nonrenewable, bread

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
for chemicals, or genetically
engineered, diversity

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:90%
disappears."

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
This loss of diversity
and abundance

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
has a metaphoric
equivalent in human life,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
for when seeds
lose their potency,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
human beings lose a powerful
symbol of renewal for the soul.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
"Seeds are the one thing that
are the only genuine promise we

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:84%
have of the future," wrote
prominent nun and activist

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
sister Joan Chittister
in her essay.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
"Seeds contain the power of
creation" and, we might add,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:90%
the power of the soul.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
"In every seed," she
wrote, "is the gift

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of life to those
seeking life, wanting

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
life, denied the kind of
life that is full of energy,

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:90%
full of hope."

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
"The Earth shares
that energy with us

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
by producing the food
our lives depend on,"

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
wrote Buddhist leader Ogyen
Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of Tibet, in his essay.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:10%
"It is very important that we
emulate the Earth's attitude

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:10%
of generosity towards
us," Dorje wrote,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:10%
"just as we would do when
receiving a precious gift

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:10%
from someone we love.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:10%
We need to nurture what
we have been given."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So there are several
ways we can begin

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
nurturing the sacred
power of seeds

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
right away, according
to Diane Longboat

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous Mohawk nation,
who suggested that people plant

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
community gardens and have
purchased foods that haven't

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:90%
been genetically modified.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
My message that I
would add to this

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is that if you don't want a
genetically modified soul,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
then don't eat
genetically modified food.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Another view is that
planting a garden

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect antidote to
our instant, Wi-Fi world.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Time is the most valuable
commodity we all have.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
How much of it we have in
this precious incarnation

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
is the great question.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Planting and nurturing a
garden takes a lot of time.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It takes patient perseverance,
thoughtfulness, and care.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point,
because gardening

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:90%
is a meditation on our soul.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
With water, sun, and
soil, a tiny seed

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
can grow into a majestic
tree, just like our soul.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
The seed's power to so
dramatically transform itself

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
seems almost mythic
in proportion,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
which is perhaps
why seeds appear

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:90%
in so many religious parables.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
In one of the
best-known metaphors

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
in the Gospel of
Mark, chapter 4,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Jesus uses a mustard seed,
a little golden nugget,

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to communicate the idea that
a new way of being, what

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:84%
he called the kingdom of
heaven, or the reign of God,

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:84%
starts out small and
conspicuous but slowly,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.100 align:middle line:84%
surely emerges into something
dramatically different

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Jesus could be talking about the
soul when he said, "What shall

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.630 align:middle line:84%
we say the kingdom of
heaven or God is like?

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Or what parable shall
we use to describe it?

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It is like a mustard seed,
which is the smallest

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:90%
of all seeds on Earth.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Yet when planted, it grows
and becomes the largest

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
of all garden plants, with such
big branches that the birds can

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:90%
perch in its shade."

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The seeds that he
encouraged us to plant

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.360 align:middle line:84%
were those of forgiveness,
nonviolence, generosity,

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:84%
If we live our lives trying
to apply these virtues,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
it might not seem like
much is happening.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But with enough patience,
individuals and societies

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:84%
will become something
they could not foresee.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
They will become cultures
that flower from the seed

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
of the light body.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how
different our world

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
would be if everyone was
focused on manifesting

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
their light body and
the rebirth renewal,

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
regeneration, and
ascension it symbolizes?

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
This would be a truly
green civilization.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is, I say,
why the seed is

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
the oldest metaphor for the
Resurrection of the body.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever noticed,
as my wife Clare

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
did, that the Tree of Life can
be beautifully superimposed

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
over a photo of the
Shroud of Turin?

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
In one of the world's
oldest Resurrection stories,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, the seed, grows into
a tree, the Tree of Life.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Osiris legend, Osiris was
induced by his wicked brother

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Set to lie down in
a magnificent coffer

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.980 align:middle line:84%
under the pretext of
a game at a banquet.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Set and his 72 conspirators
immediately closed the lid

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and threw the coffer
into the Nile.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Osiris' wife Isis, who
was also his sister,

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:84%
searched for and
found the chest, which

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
had been borne down the Nile
and across the sea to what

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was later identified as
the Phoenician coast, where

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:84%
it was deposited at the
foot of a tamarisk tree.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.410 align:middle line:84%
As this tree grew, it
enclosed Osiris and the chest

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
within its trunk,
which was later

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.030 align:middle line:84%
cut down by the king of
Byblos, or Phoenicia,

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and used as a pillar
in his palace.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
The fragrance of the pillar
became renowned far and wide.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And when Isis heard
about it, she immediately

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:90%
understood its significance.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Isis returned the pillar and
the body it contained to Egypt.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, in his earliest axis
mundi form of a tamarisk tree

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
trunk, was called Jed.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
He is the transformed
man in the tree.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
His later mummy
wrappings were symbolic

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
of his having been encased
inside a tree trunk.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
His mummy was therefore an
axis mundi, a Tree of Life,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.910 align:middle line:84%
as indeed were all
future mummies.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Over time, the tree
trunk was replaced

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
by the imagery of
a pillar, which

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
became known as the Jed Pillar,
the pillar of stability.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And here, we see the
King Seti offering

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:84%
linen strips, symbolic of the
light body, to the Jed Pillar.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.770 align:middle line:84%
The story of Osiris
tells us how a seed may

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.410 align:middle line:90%
rise to give flower or a tree.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
This soul-seed spark may give
rise to a light body as well.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we may
say that the light body

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:90%
is the soul's flower.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
By what force does a
seed manifest a flower?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Theologians say it's the
same force or power that

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
allowed a single loaf of bread
to turn into many or water

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.010 align:middle line:90%
to turn into wine.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And our soul has
access to that power,

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it's called
kundalini or the Holy Spirit.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Another viewpoint
is that the seed

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
stands for a piece of the
larger light body, which must

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.730 align:middle line:90%
be matched to its other bits.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
In the Jewish
tradition of Kabbalah

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the Sefirot, or Tree of
Life, is the spiritual symbol

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:84%
This Kabbalistic Tree
of Life, featured

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.110 align:middle line:84%
in the frontispiece of a
16th century gospel of John,

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
features lines of
attribution to the body

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus on the pillar of
crucifixion or glorification.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:84%
The Tree of Life rises above a
sphere containing the stairway

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:84%
to heaven, the menorah,
and the starry heavens.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Contained within
the almond shape

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
is the grail cup,
an atlas upholding

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the pillars Jachin
and Boaz and Jacob's Ladder

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
going through the sun and
Abraham prepared to sacrifice

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:90%
his innocent son Isaac.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.620 align:middle line:84%
It also includes the all-seeing
eye and the Horn of Plenty.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul used the
seed metaphor in his letters

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to the people of
Corinth to refer

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to our angelic life in heaven.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to read several
lines from his letter

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
now, as they speak directly
to the Christian concept

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
of the light body
in ascension, which

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:84%
is actually the foundation
for many of today's ascension

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.830 align:middle line:90%
theories.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Many people who
discuss ascension today

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.430 align:middle line:84%
are actually referring
to these lines,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.200 align:middle line:90%
whether they realize it or not.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:84%
As we go, we're going to view
a collection of images of Jesus

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
with a light body in
the midst of a tree.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I took many of these
photos in England,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
where there's a strong
tradition of such imagery.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to begin
with the 12th century

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
mosaic in the half dome at
the Basilica of San Clemente

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.460 align:middle line:84%
in Rome, where we see the Seed
of Life and the Tree of Life

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the unknown
authors cleverly

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
place the Seeds of
Life on either side

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:90%
of an entrance to this portal.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The cross grows as a pillar
from a bush or a tree.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Doves, or souls, ascend the
pillar into an open portal

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The apostle Paul begins his
letters to the Corinthians

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.830 align:middle line:84%
by saying, "But someone will
ask, how are the dead raised?

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.700 align:middle line:10%
With what kind of
body will they come?"

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:10%
Noting that Jesus
is in a tree wearing

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:10%
a rainbow-colored cloak,
Paul answers, "How foolish.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:10%
What you sow does not come
to life unless it dies.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:10%
When you sow, you do not
plant the body that will be,

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:10%
but just a seed, perhaps
of wheat or something else.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.002 align:middle line:10%
But God gives it a body,
as He is determined.

00:30:15.002 --> 00:30:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Into each kind of seed
He gives its own body."

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In an extraordinary
statement, Paul next

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
says, "Not all
flesh is the same.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:90%
People have one kind of flesh.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:10%
Animals have another, birds
another, and fish another."

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.050 align:middle line:10%
Noting once again that
Jesus is in a tree

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:10%
and wearing a cloak of
stars and sunflowers,

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:10%
Paul says, "There are
also heavenly bodies,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:10%
and there are Earthly bodies.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But the splendor of the
heavenly bodies is of one kind,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and the splendor of the
Earthly bodies is another.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.400 align:middle line:10%
The sun has one
kind of splendor,

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:10%
the moon another, and
the stars another,

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:10%
and the stars differ
from stars in splendor."

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So Paul is telling us
that the light body

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is grown from the seed
of the flesh body.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But this sacred body is
different from our Earthly

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:84%
"And so it will be with the
Resurrection of the dead.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
The body that is so perishable,
it is raised imperishable.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It is sown and dishonored,
it is raised in glory.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:10%
It is sown in weakness,
it is raised in power.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:10%
It is sown a natural body, it
is raised a spiritual body.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
If there is a natural body,
there is also a spiritual body.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:90%
And so it is written.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:84%
The first man Adam became a
living being, the last Adam

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:90%
a life-giving spirit.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual did not
come first, but the natural,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and after the spiritual.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
The first man was of
the dust of the Earth.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:10%
The second man is of heaven.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.984 align:middle line:84%
"And as was the
Earthly man, so are

00:31:45.984 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:90%
those who were of the Earth.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And as the heavenly man, so also
are those who are of heaven.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And just as we have borne
the image of the Earthly man,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
so shall we bear the
image of the heavenly man.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And then Paul delivers the key
to modern ascension mysteries

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and also plants the
seed for the belief

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.750 align:middle line:90%
in a spontaneous ascension.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:84%
"I declare to you," he
says, "brother and sisters,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
nor does the perishable
inherit the imperishable.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I tell you a mystery.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed in a flash,

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
For the trumpet
will sound, the dead

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:10%
"For the perishable must clothe
itself with the imperishable,

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.550 align:middle line:10%
and the mortal with immortality.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the perishable has been
clothed with the imperishable,"

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that is, with the light
body, "and the mortal

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.720 align:middle line:84%
with immortality, then
the saying that is written

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:90%
will come true.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:10%
Death has been swallowed
up in victory."

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:10%
It is truly amazing
to me how close

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:10%
these images of Osiris
and the Jed Pillar

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:10%
and Jesus on the pillar
of light actually are.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And the victory that we all seek
is not immortality of the body.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It is the ascension of the soul.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we will see
in the next episode,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.470 align:middle line:90%
this is the hero's journey.

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are each the hero, and
by exploring this journey,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.640 align:middle line:90%
we may find our way home.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, be humble,
and let your light shine.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.926 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:33:28.926 --> 00:33:34.360 align:middle line:90%
