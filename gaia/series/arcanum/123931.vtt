>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello,
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Awakened Soul: the
Lost Science of Ascension."

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Our world is in transition.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Something huge, something
enormous, and wonderful

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
is unfolding, and we
are all a part of it.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:90%
We are making it happen.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
The collective soul of
humanity is awakening.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It is doing so through the
challenge of world crisis

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and powerful celestial factors.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Some call it the
"Great Awakening"

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
or the "Great Shifting" or
the "Lifting of the Veil,"

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
"Spiritual Disclosure,"
or the "Ascension."

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It is all happening now.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And "Awakened Soul" is
about all of this and more.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
In search of answers, you
may have studied religion

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
or philosophy, practiced
yoga, meditation, or explored

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
the evidence for ancient angels
and extraterrestrials, even

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:90%
reptilian ones.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
You have actually been and are
on an exciting cosmic quest

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
into the discovery, secrets, and
lost science of soul ascension.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
You've picked up many clues.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And now, you wish to
put it all together.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
What comes next
in your awakening

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is the creation of
your ascension plan.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
We have health plans,
financial plans, career plans,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
retirement plans, family plans.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
What about your soul
plan, your ascension plan?

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, you
have two choices.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
One, you can say you have
a plan and it's working.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Or two, you can recognize that
this conversation is truly

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
one, maybe the only one, that
really matters at this time,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and then join us
as we go forward

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
into a spectacular adventure
into the secrets of the soul

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and ascension.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
There will be highs and
lows, levels of awakening.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We still live one
breath at a time.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Awakening your soul is a
process, not a destination.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So we will focus on living it
rather than arriving at it.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I am certain
there are keys here

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
to help you live
it the way you want

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and to maximize your
incarnation on Earth.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It could be an image.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It could be a simple
word or a phrase.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I believe that it's here.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Soul ascension has been
at the core of my work

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:90%
for nearly 20 years.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
As a mythologist, my specialty
is human transformation

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:90%
into celestial beings or angels.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I have followed the path
of the awakened ones,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the ascended ones,
the perfected ones,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
who have completed the
path of earthly incarnation

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:90%
and ascension that we are on.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They overcame the obstacles
and soul challenges

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
to cross the bridge of
eternity by manifesting

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:90%
their light body of pure love.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And now are what the ancients
called cloudriders and ascended

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
ones, celestials
and starwalkers.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, we are all
pupils in this school

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of ascension, starwalkers
in training, if you will.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting that when
pupil is spelled with an "-il,"

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:90%
it means student.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
It is also the core of the eye.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Pupal, with an "-al," is a stage
of metamorphosis as an insect

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
goes from embryo to imago, the
imaginal stage when it attains

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
maturity, as in the
case of the butterfly.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
"Psych" is the ancient Greek
word for moth or butterfly

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and creatures which transform
themselves into something new.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:84%
"Psych" is also the
ancient word for soul.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So how do we leave
our pupal phase

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
and attain our next
level of being?

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe we can do so by
studying stories of they who

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
have actualized or realized
their potential or ascended,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and how this is
possible for all of us.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
These stories are actually
mind maps for the soul.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
From Ishtar in 2300
BC to Isis and Osiris

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.476 align:middle line:84%
and Ptah in ancient Egypt
to Elijah in 800 BC,

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:49.312 align:middle line:84%
to Mary Magdalene, to Jesus,
to Padmasambhava in 880 AD

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
to Francis of Assisi
to Paramahansa

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda in the
20th century, we

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
will trace the path of soul
ascension and transcendence

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
by studying the stories
of the ascended ones.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But as we do so, as we tap into
their spiritual intelligence I

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
call ascension
intelligence, we will

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
be able to map our
minds to theirs.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
By learning to think
like the ascended ones,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:90%
we can be like them.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We do this not for
ego gratification,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
but because it is the next
step for the survival of all

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We do this to end
suffering, to glorify God,

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and to illuminate humanity,
the earth, and Gaia.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.690 align:middle line:84%
As each of us
awakens, in a sense,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the path of higher consciousness
vibrating on a higher

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
frequency, we become guides
or lights for all of humanity.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And we align with all and
with our highest goal, which

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
is connecting our world to the
greater world of light and love

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.730 align:middle line:90%
beyond this one.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have
already done this

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and have come back to
assist the rest of us.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all, though,
once again, for joining us.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We all will, sooner or later,
ask ourselves who am I,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:90%
what am I. Are we our body?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is our body merely
the container or vessel

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:90%
for something else?

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what is
that something else?

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
First, let's take
a look at our body.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Our body is, well, roughly 100
trillion or so living cells,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
apparently imagined into
form by a brain firing

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
100 billion neurons
or nerve cells.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.325 align:middle line:84%
With each cell and neuron made
of countless number of atoms,

00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
made up of electrons,
quarks, and gluons,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
numbering into the
trillions of trillions,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and all cooperating
and colliding

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
at the invisible level
to make us who we are.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But that is nothing compared to
what is at the subatomic level.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:10%
Because pulling back the veil
as do the angels and avatars,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:10%
we enter the ultra bizarre
unseen, unmeasurable

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:10%
other world of particles
and non-particles

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:10%
where things are not things.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And particles become waves that
are not there but are there.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And they do impossible
things because they're

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
motivated by the limitless
laws of quantum mechanics

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that totally contradict
limited real world

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
classical laws of nature and
the universe that is seen

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and that we experience.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so our body, our
flesh as a collection

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of invisible smashing
atoms and molecules,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
all brought to life by
something, but what is it?

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It is our soul.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Our science that
was very limited

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
when it concerns the
special something.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Theoretical physicist Dr. Michio
Kaku recently defined the soul

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:90%
as information.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:10%
It is the collection
of everything

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:10%
you have ever put on Facebook,
every memory potentially

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:10%
scanned by a supercomputer
in the future stored

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:10%
and available to be
copied in the future,

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:10%
into another version of
you just like passing data

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:10%
from your flash
drive to your PC.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at the internet
of things at this moment.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Is this the collective
soul of humanity?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it the sum total of the
information we have put online?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Is that really our soul?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We also live during a time
when quantum teleportation

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or beaming, Star Trek-style
from one location to another

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:90%
is becoming possible.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:84%
As CS Lewis said, "you
don't have a soul.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
You are a soul.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:90%
You have a body."

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The question is what happens
to our soul when we beam?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Is our soul only information?

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.626 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
else that beams, too?

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
To answer this, we can turn
to holistic and eastern

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
medical practices, which
are based on the philosophy

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.820 align:middle line:84%
that life has a quality
independent of the physical

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:90%
and chemical laws.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Disease results
from some imbalance

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in vital forces of
this something else

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.467 align:middle line:90%
that we really are.

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
They have different names
for this something else,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
elan vital, vital force, vital
spark, divine spark, the soul.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.020 align:middle line:84%
If we wake up the vital forces
of the soul beyond the body,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
we can heal ourselves
and a whole lot more.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
This philosophy is
called vitalism.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the basis for the
force in "Star Wars."

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The force is what
gives a Jedi his power,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:90%
or in this case, Jesus.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It surrounds and penetrates us.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
The takeaway here is that
the something within our body

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is a living soul, a
force, and that it

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:90%
has giant untapped powers.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
According to the Gnostic text
in Western mystical tradition,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:84%
such as Kabbalah and
Sufism, our soul force

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.912 align:middle line:84%
is also a divine spark
or seed that manifests

00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:90%
the physical body, our temple.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:10%
So our soul has a
wave particle duality.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It is a glowing, fiery particle,
thrown off from a great light.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It is a seed of a
great tree of light,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:90%
a drop from a cosmic ocean.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Gnosticism, going back
to the time of Plato,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
teaches that our divine spark
has fallen into our world

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and is entrapped in the
world of matter, symbolized

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
by the craggy rocky area in
this painting by Kano Hogai.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The soul must be awakened by
a divine aspect or celestial

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:84%
counterpart of the
self, a messenger,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.020 align:middle line:84%
so that it can remember
its true origin

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and be raised and reintegrated
with the divine sphere

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:90%
or divine realm.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
A most lucid and informative
explanation of the messenger

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
is provided by Anthony
Peake in his book,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
"The Daemon Hypothesis,"
essentially, he says,

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
we all have two
aspects to ourself,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
the every day self, the
"I," the me, or Eidolon,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:84%
lives within time and
perceives a limited amount

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:90%
of what we term reality.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Our better half is the immortal
Daemon, the secret self,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.760 align:middle line:84%
which exists outside
time in the unseen realm

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and knows not only what
has happened but also what

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:90%
will happen next.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It is also known as the heavenly
twin, the angelic spirit,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.500 align:middle line:84%
the guide of light, the guide
of the soul, perfect nature.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't often
recognize this self

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
because the Daemon has
been demonized by organized

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:90%
religion and our culture.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who
hear voices or think

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
they can turn into light
beings are crazy, right.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's like we all have a
passenger in the seat beside us

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:90%
We are largely unaware of it.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're driving
with our eyes shut.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But this higher self is trying
to help us to navigate our way

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
home to our forgotten reality.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Our soul awakening occurs
when we open our eyes

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and attain knowledge
of the celestial self,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and we begin living by its
more righteous or upright

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
directions rather than
our lower earthly self.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen your higher
self or connected with it?

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I was given a possible
glimpse of my higher self

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:90%
in January, 1999.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I had given a presentation
in Memphis, Tennessee.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And afterward, some of the group
went out for dinner together.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
A woman was sitting
across the table from me,

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:90%
and she was staring through me.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And she was concealing a
drawing that she was making.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she
produced the drawing.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.600 align:middle line:84%
This is your higher
self, she said.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was kind of blown away.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The three sacred
nuts, she said, were

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
a part of my consciousness.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't know
what they meant.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So was the related symbol
that looked like a trident.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
It took me a number of
years, but I finally

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
learned that the trident is the
symbol for an instrument that

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:90%
opens the gates of heaven.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And those three
sacred nuts, they

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
symbolize what
the Buddhists call

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the Chintamani of the Buddha.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They are the three seeds
of the awakened soul

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that produce the light body, or
sheer garment, he is wearing.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So did my higher self
reveal itself to this woman?

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the future
me, like the future you,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
was leaving clues,
like ET leaving

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Reese's Pieces for Elliott.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful Indian
expression, "Namaste,"

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
acknowledges the divine
spark or spirit force within.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.020 align:middle line:84%
To perform Namaste, we
place the hands together

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
at the heart chakra, close
the eyes, and bow the head.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It can also be done by
placing the hands together

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in front of the third
eye, bowing the head,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing the
hands down to the heart.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a spiritually-deep
practice of respect.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The hands on the heart
chakra increase the flow

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of divine love, the
spirit, without which

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:90%
nothing is possible.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Bowing the head to show our
crown and closing the eyes

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
helps the mind surrender to
the divine spark, the soul,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and merges
with the third eye.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It frees us from the body
and acknowledges the eternity

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and connects
us to its origin

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in the timeless realm.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic traditions,
which come from India,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of life is
to enable the divine

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
spark to be released from
its imprisonment in matter

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and return to God or the divine
light, the timeless realm.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:84%
In the Dead Sea
Scrolls, the Essenes

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.395 align:middle line:84%
expressed the concept of
Namaste in ascension this way.

00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
May you be as an
angel of the presence

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and the abode of holiness
to the glory of God.

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.090 align:middle line:84%
May you be as an
angel of the presence

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in the abode of holiness
to the glory of God.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
That really sets a
powerful intention.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It says we want
to become angels.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.505 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic, Christian,
and Essene tradition,

00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic Christ
is seen as an avatar

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of light, which is taken
human form in order to lead

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.840 align:middle line:90%
human souls back to the light.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a competition
for our souls.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Christianity refers to the
body made by the divine

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
spark as the temple
of the Holy Spirit.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Your body is the temple.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the Holy Spirit
that the Hebrews called "I am."

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Christianity brought
with it the idea

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
that both the soul
and the body it makes

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
will be raised together to
heaven at a future moment.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This resurrected
soul body is referred

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
to as a light body,
a soul light body

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that we will mirror
in our own ascension.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
When the Essene master John
the Baptist baptized Jesus,

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.100 align:middle line:84%
he transmitted the Holy
Spirit in waves of light

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%
into his open crown chakra.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
He infused Jesus' body
with a light, a vibration,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
that came from a
higher dimension.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
The angels wait to give
the baptized Christ

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:84%
his cloak of light, which is
called the robe of the soul,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and is worn by all the ascended
beings in the higher frequency

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
new world.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is our goal.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Acquiring this soul
garment is our life goal.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And our soul uses it to
open doors to other realms.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Just as a person
changes his clothes,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
our soul can change our
body from incarnation

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:90%
to incarnation.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
We can rearrange the molecules
and change our soul clothes.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' soul transfiguration,
a metamorphosis,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated that our
body is transformable.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Though a divine spark,
the soul is redeemable.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:90%
It's immortal.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
stars, and we literally

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.540 align:middle line:90%
are truly made of star stuff.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Every single atom of our body,
except hydrogen and traces

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
of other light elements,
was formed in a supernova.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:84%
When a star explodes, it briefly
changes into a butterfly form.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
This is another reason
why the butterfly

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
is one of the more profound
symbols for the awakened soul.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
As Jesus taught, loving
actions awaken the soul

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and produce bright white
clothes for the soul.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the White Tara
radiating her light body.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism teaches that we can
transform our world and ascend

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to a purer place by
purifying our soul.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We do this by changing
the actions of our lives

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:90%
from the inside out.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Just as 90% of losing
weight is about what

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
you put in your mouth,
90% of ascension

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
is about what comes
out of your heart.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Ascension and
attaining a light body

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:84%
is about what you do or
don't do in each moment.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
In addition to loving
actions, another way

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics and Buddhists
teach us to do this

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
is through contemplation
of sacred images

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of soul transfiguration.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
My wife Clare hosted
a series on Gaiam

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
called "Arcanum,"
in which we explored

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the power of sacred art to
illuminate and enlighten us.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, this is a sacred
practice, called ekagrata,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
or one point of focus
on sacred images.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that is that as
we connect with the images,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
we become them as we actually
are one with everything

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:90%
always in any way.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:84%
According to
Buddhism, each of us

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
holds within an
exhaustless source

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:90%
of compassion and wisdom.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is to connect
with our most essential nature,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
our light body, that
has been covered over

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.170 align:middle line:84%
by negative emotions
and false perceptions.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways to remind
ourselves of them, among them

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
are meditation, prayers,
yoga, recitation of mantras,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:84%
construction of inspiring
places, visiting sacred places.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.702 align:middle line:84%
But in Buddhism, there is
especially open eye meditations

00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
on light body
images such as this,

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
which portray the state of being
of the ascended human form.

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Sacred images play our
DNA like we play a piano.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And as we contemplate, meditate,
and reflect on the images,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
we begin to mirror them
from the inside out.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
This is based on the
Egyptian practice of making

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
magically active images.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So long as an action was seen
performed on the temple walls,

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:90%
it existed into eternity.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
This is why the early
Christians hacked out

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the body parts of the Pharaohs
and severed the connection

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:90%
with the divine realm.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
One of our jobs is to
reassemble the lost connection

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
to the sacred imagination,
the mind of the soul.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I am personally
astounded by the power

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, the awakened
soul and the power

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:90%
of images to activate the soul.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Like the Egyptians and Gnostics,
Buddhist ascension teachings

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
say that paintings can become
portals to the afterlife realm.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
To give you an example, one
of my favorite examples,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at this
welcoming descent painting,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
like this one, which were
indispensable religious

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
furnishings at
the time of death.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Such paintings depict
the scene in which

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:84%
the Amida Buddha
and his attendants

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
descend from heaven on clouds
to take a believing soul back

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
to the Western paradise, where
pure land and the lotus throne.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The scrolls were often hung
by or beside the bedside

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
of the dying to ensure
the prospect of rebirth

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
in paradise.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Since traditionally, the
dying lay with their heads

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to the north and their
faces turned west,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
welcoming descent
paintings usually

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
depict the Buddha
and his entourage

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:84%
coming from the upper left
down to the lower right

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:84%
so as to meet the
gaze of the dying.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, silken cords were
attached to the Buddhist's

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
hand, offering the dying
physical assistance

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.575 align:middle line:90%
during the journey to paradise.

00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
until 1926, humans

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
believed we lived in a celestial
egg, our Milky Way galaxy,

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and that it was the
entirety of the universe?

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Until 100 years ago,
humanity thought

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
the entire universe was
comprised of only the stars we

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:90%
see in the night sky.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we look
into the night sky,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
all the stars we see are in
the yellow dot in this image.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously a
lot more out there.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Then, Hubble began looking
at photographs of the night

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
sky that showed cloudy
patches, called nebulae,

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
or interstellar clouds of dust.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of Hubble's colleagues at
the Mount Wilson Observatory

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:84%
thought these
fuzzy eggs of light

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:90%
were all in the Milky Way.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:90%
But Hubble didn't think so.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Hubble answered the question by
taking the best possible photos

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
of these fuzzy eggs
and proved that they

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
were outside and
beyond the Milky Way.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.265 align:middle line:84%
The cloudy egg of light
was a whole other galaxy,

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and we named the newly
discovered galaxy Andromeda.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
She was named after the
goddess in Greek mythology

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
who was chained naked
to a rock as a sacrifice

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to the sea monster Cetus but
was saved from death by Perseus,

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
who rides in on his flying
white horse of light.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Hubble's discovery
led to the realization

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that our galaxy is a
sister galaxy to hundreds

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
of billions of galaxies that
inhabit the known universe.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:84%
More, Hubble proved our
universe is expanding.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:10%
And this realization led
scientists to seek and discover

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:10%
the origins of the universe.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Hubble's discovery completely
shattered our understanding

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
of existence by increasing
the size of the known universe

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
many, many times
over, Hubble took us

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
into the soul's true garden
and closer to our origins.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
His discovery cracked
open the cosmic egg.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was humanity's
Great Awakening.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:10%
In the 1950s, the
Gaia Hypothesis

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:10%
proposed our Mother Earth
is a conscious being.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of its life functions
as an organic whole.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:10%
In 2013, NASA validated
the Quran's assertion

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:10%
that the earth is
actually egg-shaped.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So if the person is a conscious,
living and loving being,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.840 align:middle line:90%
how about our galaxy?

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
What if it, too, is
a conscious entity?

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Can our galaxy be viewed as
a divine spark or cosmic egg

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in a greater body of souls,
just as our soul is a divine

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:90%
spark in our galaxy?

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
For we now know
that our galaxy is

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
one of 100,000 galaxies in
what is known as the Laniakea

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.535 align:middle line:90%
Supercluster of Galaxies.

00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:10%
But this is only a tiny fraction
of the universe's estimated

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:57.060 align:middle line:10%
total of 125 billion galaxies.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:03.040 align:middle line:10%
Laniakea is a Hawaiian word
meaning "immeasurable heaven."

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The Hubble Space
Telescope opened a gateway

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:90%
to this "immeasurable heaven."

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've always loved the word
play or pun in the name Hubble.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:90%
"Hu" means God.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And with the addition
of a letter "a,"

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:84%
the "bble" becomes
"Bable," the name

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
of the ladder or gate to
God in the pivotal story

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:90%
of the book of Genesis.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.500 align:middle line:84%
The Tower of Babel was
located in ancient Babylon,

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
which was associated with
lust and prostitution.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, when
Hubble discovered the Andromeda

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, he did so while peering
through the Hooker Space

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Telescope.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
The universe definitely
has a sense of humor.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
In the book of Genesis, the
Old Testament God Yahweh

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the Tower of Babel,
fearing that with this ladder,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
nothing would be
impossible for humanity.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
The Hubble Space Telescope
clearly opened a gate

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to the stars, a stargate in
our consciousness, a soul gate.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, perhaps nothing will
be impossible for us.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually, watching
that Billy Meier video

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:90%
wasn't my first awakening.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I had spent part of the
1980s doing private research

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
for a self-help guru,
answering questions

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:90%
like, how does the brain work.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do people fail?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
What is culture?

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Why do people gain weight?

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing educational
experience for me.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it at the
time, but this research

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
was preparing me for
my own soul awakening.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:84%
This came when I entered a
literary contest, sponsored

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
by media mogul Ted Turner,
who was seeking answers

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to our world's problems.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
In 1989, Turner said that
science and technology can't

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:90%
solve the world's problems.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:10%
And he offered $500,000 for the
best piece of fiction dealing

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:10%
with themes ensuring the
survival and prosperity

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:10%
of all life on Earth.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
My story was called
"Turtle Island."

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
It was based on my
previous research.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It focused on a sage's dream
to build an academy where

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.545 align:middle line:84%
the children of the world
would gather to learn to build

00:27:18.545 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:90%
a new human civilization.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.776 align:middle line:90%
I named this school "Tula."

00:27:23.776 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know where
the name came from.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
It just popped into my head,
and it sounded really nice.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And in my story, Tula was the
largest man-made structure

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:37.220 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, so large it could
be a seen from Earth's orbit.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:40.425 align:middle line:84%
It was shaped like an egg,
with butterfly-shaped wings

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and a heart-shaped head.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the symbols
of rebirth, renewal,

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and regeneration and the soul.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I actually pulled these
symbols off the glass doors

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:90%
leading into my study.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And in my story,
this giant structure

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.730 align:middle line:84%
was meant to be interpreted
by otherworldly beings

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
as a sign of our
civilization's advancement,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
sort of like the Batman symbol
in the sky, if you will.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But I was soon in
for a huge surprise.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I learned that Tula actually
existed in the ancient world.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was the
name of the temple

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl,
the winged or feathered

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:90%
serpent.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Tula was also the name
of the central healing

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.270 align:middle line:84%
sun, or the "spiritual
son" as the ancients

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
called it, the Golden
Womb, from whence

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
the ancients believed all our
souls originated and remain

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.400 align:middle line:84%
connected to and
ultimately will return to.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The ancient sources said that
this place, Tula, feeds us

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
with a cosmic essence, a
healing wisdom, rays, or waters.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And our sun is a gateway
for this cosmic energy

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.980 align:middle line:90%
that feeds the soul.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It was incredible to me that I
pulled a name out of thin air,

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and it happened to be the name
of the place our souls came

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The soul loves synchronicity
or remembering, right.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
This discovery set me off to
learn more about the Milky Way.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.285 align:middle line:84%
We all have much to remember
about our cosmic egg, our home

00:29:18.285 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:90%
galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient traditions
regard the Milky Way

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
as the pathway built by
the gods, which souls

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:90%
follow to the other world.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
At the end of this path
lies the land of the dead,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:84%
which is viewed as a return to
greater life from the soul's

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
In 500 BC, the Greek
philosopher Pythagoras

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:47.572 align:middle line:84%
taught that our souls dwell
in the waters of the Milky

00:29:47.572 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Way between
incarnations, inferring

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
that when we incarnate
on Earth, we each

00:29:55.180 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
bring a ray of the
healing sun with us.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Astrophysicist Dr.
Paul LaViolette

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
traced these myths and the
source of these healing waters,

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the source of our soul, to the
black hole at our cosmic egg

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.580 align:middle line:84%
The black hole is seen
in this NASA image

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
as a bright white
spot surrounded

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.300 align:middle line:90%
by beautiful ethereal purple.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Is this the source of our souls?

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the ancients
had a source of knowledge

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:90%
beyond our science?

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Could it be they knew the
secrets of the soul's origin

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:38.480 align:middle line:84%
itself, and we are now
rediscovering that source?

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.515 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, NASA discovered
that a pillar of gamma rays

00:30:42.515 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is spewing from the
galactic center.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:10%
For the first time,
human beings not only

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.940 align:middle line:10%
grasped our place
within the Milky Way

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:10%
but we also
potentially discovered

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:10%
secrets about our
source, almost as

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:01.230 align:middle line:10%
if we are being welcomed home.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.510 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a moment to
look at this incredible NASA

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:10%
animation of our home galaxy.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It is truly awe-inspiring
and soul-tingling.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
For generations, the
existence of this pillar

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.300 align:middle line:84%
of light within the spinning
cosmic egg was unknown.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.006 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask, what
else is out there

00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that we have yet to detect?

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:84%
My Turner Tomorrow
award experience

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:84%
left me with the belief that
teaching children and all

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of humanity about
the soul really

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is the answer to our
world's problems.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to get beyond
the skin and see

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.380 align:middle line:90%
the soul within everything.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Think about how different
our world, your world

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:84%
would be if instead of just
being educated as a child,

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:90%
you were also illuminated.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:84%
In the spring of 1991,
I read a wonderful book

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
called "Life Between Life" by
Joel Whitten and Joe Fisher.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
This book dealt with
themes about reincarnation

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:90%
and the other side.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
The authors ask the
questions, what happens

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.990 align:middle line:90%
during the space between lives.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Where do our souls reside when
we are not incarnated on Earth?

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Where do we spend our
life between lives?

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it spent in the Milky
Way as Pythagoras taught?

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Where were you before
you came to Earth,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and where are you
going from here?

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
thought about this?

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:90%
I know you have.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:90%
And what have you concluded?

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Please share it with
us, if you would like.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It will help all
of us to remember.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The circumstantial evidence
presented in the book

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
suggests that our
soul evolution is

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
decided prior to entering into
another physical lifetime.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.350 align:middle line:84%
As people and situations
enter our lives,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand
that these were preselected

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.340 align:middle line:90%
by us before we incarnated.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that?

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:10%
How many times have you
solidly, irrefutably recognized

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:10%
or experienced this?

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:10%
"Life Between Life" inspired
me to write my second book.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.400 align:middle line:10%
Its title is
"Junior Cosmic Egg."

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:10%
And it is the story
of a cosmic egg

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:10%
named Junior, who wants to grow
up to become his own universe.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
During this time, I was leading
a children's Sunday School

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
at a religious science
church in Nashville

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and intended "Junior"
to be a children's book.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I hoped that the story of
this tiny egg realizing

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.750 align:middle line:84%
the unlimited potential
packed inside him

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.210 align:middle line:84%
would inspire kids of
all ages to explore

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
the power within themselves
and our astonishing universe.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I envisioned a children's
metaphysical workshop

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:84%
around "Junior," in
which he would teach kids

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:84%
the lost language of
symbolism as a way

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to unite the children
of the world.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I hand-illustrated hundreds
of copies of this book

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and gave out Junior
Cosmic Egg Awards

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
for outstanding
achievement in the service

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:84%
to the transformation
of the human race.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Al Gore, Oprah Winfrey,
Don Henley, Dr. John Lilly

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.199 align:middle line:90%
were among my awardees.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I would surprise
them at public events

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.510 align:middle line:84%
with their award for
their achievements.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And with "Junior
Cosmic Egg" in hand,

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I set off lecturing on the
Whole Life Expo circuit.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.760 align:middle line:84%
My topic was "Kids and
the New Consciousness."

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gone about
collecting stories

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:28.699 align:middle line:84%
of children's interactions
with angels, extraterrestrials,

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:84%
and even Jesus, most of which
were absolutely astounding.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And it led me to
realize that there's

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot more going on in
our world than most realize.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Often, it was the
parents who contributed

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:90%
the most amazing stories.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that they,
too, had experienced

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:90%
these otherworldly beings.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.747 align:middle line:84%
But being children
of the '50s and '60s,

00:34:50.747 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:84%
they weren't able to tell their
parents about these encounters

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.996 align:middle line:84%
for fear that they
wouldn't believe them

00:34:54.996 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:90%
or they'd think they're weird.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But our world has
shifted dramatically

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:90%
in the past 25 years.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, angels and
extraterrestrials

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:90%
are the new normal.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Our universe has expanded.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Our collective
soul is awakening.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
We are ascending and getting
closer to discovering

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:90%
the lost science of the soul.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:10%
"Junior Cosmic
Egg" introduced me

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:10%
to a whole new world of
mythology I never knew existed.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I learned that for
thousands of years,

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.580 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic egg had
symbolized the soul,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.480 align:middle line:84%
going back 7,000 years to
the incredible Algarve egg.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.730 align:middle line:84%
The ancients in all
lands revered the egg

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.120 align:middle line:84%
as the symbol of
regeneration and immortality

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy and the soul.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.470 align:middle line:84%
To alchemists, it was the
philosophical egg, guarded

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:90%
by the serpent or dragon.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
There's that
reptilian code again.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Since the paleolithic
times, the beginning of life

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
has been described as the
hatching of a cosmic egg,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.090 align:middle line:84%
laid by a sacred great
mother bird, the golden goose

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.920 align:middle line:84%
or ghoost as in Holy
Ghost of fairy tales

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that drops the egg into the
waters of space or chaos.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.715 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting
that Laniakea,

00:36:17.715 --> 00:36:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the "immeasurable heaven"
resembles a bird in flight?

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:84%
This is a bird-shaped jug
from Phaistos on ancient Crete

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:90%
from around 2000 BC.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Within its body are
spirals and eggs.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It tells the story of
how this egg cracked open

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and all life appeared.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic energy, or essence, the
seed from which all life began,

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
including our souls,
sprang into existence

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and fanned out in
spiraling ways.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible that
it looks astonishingly

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:84%
similar to the spiraling funnel
of emissions NASA discovered

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.210 align:middle line:84%
coming from the supermassive
black hole buried

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of
our galaxy in 2010.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:84%
To ancient philosophers,
the question

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
about which came first, the
chicken or the egg, also

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:84%
evoke questions of how life,
the soul, and the universe

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:90%
in general began.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
To Aristotle, they
both always existed.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:84%
For Plato, before everything
appeared on Earth,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
it first existed in
spirit as a thought.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of Plato, I have
traced his story of Atlantis

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to the temple of Horus
at Edfu in Egypt, where

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.770 align:middle line:84%
we find that the
Edfu creation text,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and also to Dendera, Egypt.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:84%
These texts say that
in the beginning

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian cosmology, there is
the cosmic egg that emerged out

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit
waters of creation.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:10%
Blue light beings
with bird heads,

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:10%
bearing some kind of technology,
emerged from the cosmic egg

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:10%
and created the island of the
egg, out of which emerged,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:10%
or hatched, the first
human civilization.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.110 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the egg in
creation myths is ubiquitous.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere
throughout the world.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:84%
In the Indian knowledge system,
for example, the cosmic egg

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:84%
is known as Hiranyagarbha,
meaning a golden hued womb.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang of
creation is expressed

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:26.820 align:middle line:84%
as Brahmanda Visphotak,
or universal explosion.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.860 align:middle line:84%
In the Kalevala, the
Finnish national epic,

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a myth of the
world being created

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:90%
from the fragments of an egg.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And according to Chinese
mythology, in the beginning

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing
in the universe

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.200 align:middle line:90%
except a formless chaos.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, this chaos coalesced
into a cosmic egg

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
for about 18,000 years before
breaking in half to create

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:90%
the sky and the earth.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The idea that our souls
came from or is a cosmic egg

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.690 align:middle line:84%
is actually shared by the Celts,
the Greeks, the Egyptians,

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Phoenicians, Canaanites,
Tibetans, Hindus, Vietnamese,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Chinese, Russians, Central
Americans, and Indonesians.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It suggests to me
that this concept was

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
a self-evident truth
or that someone

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.340 align:middle line:84%
had given this code symbol,
this code of the soul,

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to these varied peoples through
some form of revelation,

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:30.060 align:middle line:84%
perhaps by some form of ethereal
spirit or wandering missionary

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.710 align:middle line:90%
or missionaries.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
In their art, the Mayans
were among several cultures

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that used what we
call the letter

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
G to symbolize the egg creator,
the essence, and the Milky Way.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
When the G appears on the walls
of Mayan temples, pyramids,

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
sculptures, or in their codices,
says Mayan ceremonial leader

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Hunbatz Men, it's a code
symbol for the secret mysteries

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of the science or religion of
the Milky Way, the cosmic eggs.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:84%
How the Mayans knew a galaxy
was G-shaped is unknown.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:12.750 align:middle line:84%
But the Maya were not alone in
symbolizing the galaxy by a G.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.380 align:middle line:10%
This Neolithic design depicts
two human figures consisting

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:10%
of two triangles in
almond-shaped enclosures

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.720 align:middle line:10%
on either side of a
meandering belt of G's.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The primitive
artist who rendered

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:84%
this scene was supposed to have
been barely capable of playing

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.200 align:middle line:84%
with sticks and stones, yet
from a modern point of view,

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
its narrative suggests
knowledge of wormholes

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.750 align:middle line:90%
linking multiple galaxies.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:10%
It appears to me
that this figure

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:10%
started at one end of
the belt of galaxies

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and starwalked through the
other four G's, or galaxies.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.310 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years, the
clockwise spiral ideogram

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.010 align:middle line:84%
has been strongly associated
with water, power,

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and outgoing energy.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Starting from the
middle, it forms

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:84%
a G. Its mirror or twin
image or inversion,

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
the spiral in its
counterclockwise rotation,

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.380 align:middle line:84%
appeared at approximately
the same time.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be an Egyptian
hieroglyph for "thread."

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Both symbols resemble a fetus.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And a similar Chinese ideogram
means return or homecoming.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:84%
To the Mayans, the
G also represented

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.120 align:middle line:90%
the concept of zero, an egg.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And the egg happens to be
a modern scientific symbol

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.290 align:middle line:90%
meaning galaxy.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Going deeper, the
G shape is also

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the musical notation
for a whole note,

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.340 align:middle line:90%
which also resembles an egg.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:84%
As this sacred note
rises within us,

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.970 align:middle line:84%
we transform, is
the message here.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.510 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
the creator god Ptah

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.505 align:middle line:84%
was a potter who
fashioned the human body

00:41:59.505 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:90%
by potting it like an egg.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Mithras, the Roman god,
was born from a cosmic egg.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.915 align:middle line:84%
And the Magi of
the Christ story,

00:42:09.915 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
knew the secret of the
mystical cosmic egg.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the earliest
icons of Mary

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.520 align:middle line:84%
shows Jesus in a glowing
transparent cosmic egg

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.670 align:middle line:90%
in her womb.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This image has tremendous
spiritual power now

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that we know we are all
considered to be cosmic eggs.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Until the eighth
century, the Christ child

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
was shown in a cosmic
egg, in this case, blue.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.350 align:middle line:10%
And as we will explore
in detail later,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:10%
the blue egg or blue sphere is
actually a bubble for transport

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.730 align:middle line:10%
and is described by shamans
as a sort of quantum egg

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:10%
that the soul uses to phase
in and out of our reality.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Finally, our transfiguration
or change in form,

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.860 align:middle line:84%
as occurred to Jesus, is
symbolized by the egg of light

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:09.610 align:middle line:84%
surrounding Jesus during
the transfiguration when

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:90%
His body became a star gate.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The egg of light is also
seen in the ascension.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:23.085 align:middle line:84%
The resurrected Christ is often
enthroned in a cosmic egg.

00:43:23.085 --> 00:43:26.430 align:middle line:84%
It is the Merkabah
egg, the throne

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
or chariot of the soul
of Jewish mysticism.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And, according to
tradition, some time

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
after the Resurrection
of Christ,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene went to Rome
to see emperor Tiberius Caesar

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and announced to him that
Christ had risen from the dead

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and explained how
it all took place.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
After she finished,
Tiberius noticed

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.465 align:middle line:84%
a man next to him
holding a basket of eggs.

00:43:55.465 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And Tiberius challenged Mary
that if what she said was true,

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.910 align:middle line:84%
then the white
eggs in the basket

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:90%
should be turned into red eggs.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the eggs turned red,
leaving Caesar astonished.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
decorate eggs on Easter.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And the appearance of Christ
is symbolized by the egg.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it is upon this
blue cosmic egg or sphere

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that Christ will appear on
Judgment Day or the Second

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Coming.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:84%
As we see here, blue angels
compose the cosmic egg.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So do such similar
origin stories

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:84%
exist simply because all life
on Earth starts from an egg,

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
even though early
humans presumably

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:84%
did not know that we,
too, begin life in an egg?

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Or might it reveal
that our ancestors

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.060 align:middle line:84%
had a greater knowledge
of our soul, our world,

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and our universe
than we imagine?

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Might they have known that
our soul is a cosmic egg,

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and that one day,
we, too, will ascend

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to the stars in a cosmic egg?

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Until next time, be humble.

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.
