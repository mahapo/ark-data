sent from another world that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.125 align:middle line:84%
could magically fulfill
all your wishes.

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: We're talking
about the Chintamani

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:90%
stone, the stone of Shambhala.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, the
Chintamani is said

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to be one of four
relics that came

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.747 align:middle line:84%
in the chest that
fell from the sky.

>>CLARE: Though the
king who discovered them

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
didn't not understand the
purpose of the objects,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:90%
he kept them and revered them.

object was typically

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
conceived as a fiery
or luminous pearl,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and traditions concerning it
spread from India to Tibet

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to Central Asia, China, Japan,
Korea, and even to America.

>>WILLIAM: It was March, 1933.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The Great Depression
was suffocating

the American spirit.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The Dust Bowl had transformed
America's breadbasket

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
into an absolute
desolate wasteland.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And America was looking
for a new beginning,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:90%
looking for answers.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Enter Franklin D.
Roosevelt, a wounded king

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.935 align:middle line:10%
who, like King Arthur,
rose from his throne

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:10%
and promised a New Deal to
transform this wasteland

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:10%

FDR's Secretary of Agriculture
and hand-picked successor.

Library of Congress
historian Paul Sifton

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:10%
said "Henry A. Wallace is among
the most genuinely learned men

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in American public life since
Benjamin Franklin and Thomas

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:10%
Jefferson."

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:90%
That's really saying something.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
What most don't realize
is that he was also

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
a disciple of a Russian
master and artist named

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Nicholas Roerich.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:10%
Wallace sent Roerich
on an expedition

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:10%
to Mongolia that lasted six
years, ostensibly to collect

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:10%
seeds of plants that
could resist drought.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:10%
But behind the scenes, most
knew there was another agenda.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what insiders
knew is that Roerich

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
was sent to Mongolia to
search for signs of the Second

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Coming of Jesus and also the
secrets of the Holy Grail.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, an
even greater secret.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Born in Saint
Petersburg, Russia,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Roerich lived around the
world until his death

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in Naggar, India in 1947.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary genius who came
from a royal family in Russia,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:84%
he was trained as an
artist and a lawyer.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And his interests included
literature, geography,

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, archaeology,
but especially

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
art, a true modern
Renaissance man.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It was in his later
years that his abundance

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of creative genius as a great
artist, scholar, and writer

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and explorer came to the
attention of the world.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But then after this
significant episode

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
in his life with
FDR and Wallace,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
his reputation was severely,
severely tarnished.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
The reason why, we will
reveal momentarily.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Wallace had been a disciple
of Roerich since the 1920s,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and both men were deeply
steeped in ancient occult lore

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and also deeply inspired by
the promise of a new world

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
order, a New Deal, a new order
of the ages, if you will.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:84%
A return, even,
to the golden age.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:84%
As a painter, Roerich was
influenced by Victor Vasnetsov,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
a fellow friend and
well known artist.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Roerich, however, was
one who was destined

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate
his spiritual work

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
with his artistic endeavors.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:10%
Roerich claimed to possess
the Chintamani Stone,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:10%
one of four relics that came
to Earth in a chest from heaven

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:10%
and is held by bodhisattvas,
or enlightened being.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Between 1923 and 1928, Roerich
followed the path, the alleged

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:10%
path of the so-called
lost years of Jesus

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:10%
and took the Chintamani stone
into the heartland of the Far

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:10%
East in order to reunite
it with the mother

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:10%
stone it had originally
been separated from,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.836 align:middle line:10%
a massive jewel that
resided in Shambhala,

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:10%
the Land of the Immortals.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We have representations
here of Roerich's path

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
as he traveled through
India on into Mongolia,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
through Tibet to the Land of the
Immortals in search Shambhala.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, though, it was these
three men, FDR Nicholas Roerich

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and Henry A. Wallace, who were
to reenact the archetypal drama

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
of the three wise men seeking
the secrets of the Holy

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Grail, the Chintamani and
this Land of the Immortals.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:90%
What did they discover?

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Ah, that's what remains to
be seen in this episode.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.645 align:middle line:84%
Evidence that this expedition
took place is abundant.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Excuse me, at the Henry A.
Wallace library in Iowa,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
we find a cachet
of letters written

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
by Henry Wallace
to Nicholas Roerich

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
during the course
of the expedition.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I secured copies
of those letters

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and began to investigate
and, in fact, to decode them.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Historians such as Pulitzer
Prize winner Arthur Schlesinger

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
have looked at
these letters, which

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
are known as the Guru Letters,
and have pretty well dismissed

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
They dismiss them
because they're

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:90%
gibberish to these scholars.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
they don't have eyes to see.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
language to decode

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
what Wallace and
Roerich are speaking of.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at
one of these Guru Letters.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:10%
It's dated March 12, 1933.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:10%
The opening salutation
of the letter

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:10%
says, Dear Guru-- this is
the salutation that Wallace

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:10%
used when writing to his
guru, Nicholas Roerich.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:10%
By the way, he signs the
letter with the letter G.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:10%
This is said to be short for
Galahad, the nickname given

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:10%
to Henry Wallace by Nicholas
Roerich's wife, Helena.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:10%
Galahad, of course, is the
last knight of the Round Table

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:10%
to possess the Grail
and to see Christ.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:10%
So right off the bat, we
know that Henry A. Wallace

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:10%
is a disciple of a Russian
mystic and guru and painter.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And he fancies himself
as a Grail knight

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:10%
on the quest for the Grail.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:10%
So looking at the first
paragraph of the letter,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:10%
he says, "Dear Guru,
I have been thinking

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:10%
of you holding the casket, the
sacred most precious casket.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And I have thought
of the new country--"

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
which is assumed to be
America, the new Atlantis

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
in their vernacular-- "going
forth to meet the seven

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
stars under the sign
of the three stars.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have thought of the
admonition, "await the stone"."

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
we know that the stone
they are awaiting

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
is the Chintamani Stone, the
wish-fulfilling jewel that

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
promises extraordinary power to
the person that possesses it.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism and
Buddhism, the Arcanum

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
is called the Chintamani Stone,
or the wish-fulfilling jewel.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the subjects
of Roerich's paintings

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
as we're seeing here and
will explore in more detail

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
momentarily.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.138 align:middle line:84%
The Chintamani is one
of four relics that

00:08:38.138 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth in the
chest from the heavens

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
and is said to be held
by the bodhisattvas,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.910 align:middle line:90%
or the enlightened beings.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have to imagine that
Nicholas Roerich imagines

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
himself as close to, if
not on the same level,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:90%
as these enlightened beings.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And so now we know what Wallace
and Roerich are speaking

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.250 align:middle line:84%
of when he says, "We await the
stone and we welcome you again

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to this glorious land
of destiny"-- America--

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
"Clouded though it may be
with strange fumbling fears.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Who shall hold up
the compelling vision

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to those who wander in darkness?

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In answer to this question,
we again welcome you.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:90%
To drive out depression.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
To drive out fear.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
We think of the people
of northern Shambhala

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and the hastening feet of
the successor of Buddha

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:84%
and the lightning flashes in
the breaking of the new day."

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.939 align:middle line:84%
What is Wallace
talking about here?

00:09:30.939 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're a historian,
you're looking

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
at this thinking, who
is-- what-- Buddha?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in March 1933 when
this letter is written,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
most Americans are
going to churches

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
with white-picket
fences out front.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Little did they know
that the president, FDR,

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and his Secretary of
Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
were talking with a Russian
mystic about the people

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
of Shambhala, the
Land of the Immortals,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and the successor of Buddha
and the breaking of a new day?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
This is all alchemical language
that they're using here

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
for the New Deal, for the new
Golden Age which had been long

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:90%
prophesied and anticipated.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Wallace closes
his letter saying,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
"And so I await your
convenience prepared

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:90%
to do what I am here to do."

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
He's a man on a mission.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
"May peace, joy, and fire
attend you as always,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
G. In the great haste of
this strange maelstrom

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
which is Washington."

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
This letter sets up
our entire quest here.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:84%
We know Roerich is going
to Shambhala seeking

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
the Chintamani
Stone, and he wants

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring it back
to America for FDR.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary, isn't it?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Shambhala is a mythical kingdom
that represents a Golden Age.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Geographically, it's thought
to be located in Central Asia.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Psychically, however,
it's within us.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And Roerich and Wallace and
FDR most certainly knew this.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the subject of many of
Roerich's amazing paintings,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
a gifted and talented
artist who is truly

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
tapped in to the
universal secrets

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
rhythms of the cosmos.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
In painting after
painting, we are

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:84%
enchanted by his use of
color, his use of landscape

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to open vistas
in our consciousness.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorites is his
the Most Sacred Treasure

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:10%
of the Mountains, which features
Christ holding the Grail

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:10%
with fire emanating
from the Grail cup.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely stunning.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:10%
And even more stunning
to behold it in person.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:10%
Saint Panteleimon the
Healer, from 1931,

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:10%
is also mystical and magical.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Saint Issa was the
name of Jesus in Asia.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so Roerich paints
him as Issa and the Skull

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Giant, with Jesus having
the magical blue orb or nimbus

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:90%
around his head.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Then we have Christ
in the Desert

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
from 1933, the very
period when Wallace

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
is writing to Roerich
concerning the search

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
for the second coming and
the secrets of the Grail

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%
and Shambhala.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the color,
feel the vibrancy

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual intention
behind this painting,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
and the thought that
what Roerich is doing

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
is seeking the Grail
cup, the Chintamani,

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the
people of America

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to make an enormous
difference in our world.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Some believe
Shambhala only exists

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:84%
in a parallel universe
or a higher dimension.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And in my view,
from the research

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I've done on
Nicholas Roerich, he

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:84%
was very comfortable in speaking
of otherworldly realms as well

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:90%
as celestial beings.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
He himself carries this
immense light and intensity

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.980 align:middle line:90%
in his gaze.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And just his persona, unmatched
perhaps in the modern era

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
until the likes of, say,
Salvador Dali, for example.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich is
seeking this though.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We must repeat on behalf
of FDR and the New Deal,

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:84%
a piece of history
little known by many.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember
that, actually, Roerich, FDR

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and Wallace, these three
wise men, are in a race.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:90%
They're racing the Nazis.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They're racing Adolf Hitler
and Heinrich Himmler,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
who have also
dispatched mythologists

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual people
to Southern France

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
as well as to Tibet in search
of the secrets of the Grail

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.285 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the Nazis.

00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It's both seeking
these secrets, maybe

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.220 align:middle line:84%
not for the power of love, but
rather for the love of power.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Buddhist
Kalachakra teaching

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
is what prepares
one to link with

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and entire Shambhala, the
Realm of the Immortals.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a transmission that
is given by the Dalai Lama.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And according to Kalachakra
Tantra, the kind of Shambhala

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
requested teaching
from the Buddha that

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
would allow him to practice
the Dharma without renouncing

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
his worldly enjoyments and
responsibilities, which

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:90%
is the usual practice.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The Kalachakra is classified
as a secret teaching,

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's thought of
by some to be the most

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
advanced of all
tantric teachings.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtedly, Roerich
would have been

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:90%
an initiate of the Kalachakra.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a Sanskrit
term, by the way,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that's used in Tantric Buddhism
that literally means time wheel

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:90%
or time cycles.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And as we look at the imagery
that symbolizes the Kalachakra,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:10%
we're immediately thinking
of entrance ways or portals

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
into other time cycles
or other dimensions.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in Tibetan Buddhism,
the Kalachakra Mandala

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
is a cosmographic representation
of the inner, the outer,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
and alternative
dimensions of reality.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we're
encouraged to engage

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the images of the
Kalachakra initiation

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and allow the frequency and
the vibration of this artwork

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to attune us, to allow us to
open up our hearts and minds

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:90%
to these alternate realities.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:10%
This one here is a
particular favorite

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:10%
because we're, again,
encouraged to go inward,

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:10%
to seek Shambhala
in the inner plane,

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:10%
in the alternate inner reality.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Roerich wrote specifically
of the wizard teachers

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:10%
of Shambhala.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:10%
Teaching, he said, is
the highest relation

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:10%
that can be achieved
in our earthly images,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:10%
indicating that Roerich is
understanding that art can be

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:10%
used as a powerful
teaching tool.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:10%
He writes in his essay
Radiant Shambhala

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:10%
that "We are led by
the Teachers and we

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:10%
are striving for perfection in
our reverence for the Teacher."

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:10%
Of course, perfection
is a primary concept

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:10%
in the idea of alchemy
where we're all

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:10%
learning or attempting
to perfect ourselves,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:10%
to become more whole, more
holy, more complete beings.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So how did Nicholas Roerich
learn about the Chintamani

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Stone?

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's well documented,
as a matter of fact.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It happened when he was building
the first Buddhist temple

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
in Saint Petersburg, Russia,
which was completed in 1913.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
He found favor with
Agran Dordgiev,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
the Lama supervising
this project.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Trusting Roerich,
he confided in him

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:84%
the whereabouts of
the elusive Chintamani

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
which was last seen in
the late 18th century

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.381 align:middle line:90%
by an Arab scholar.

00:16:31.381 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Agran told him that the
stone, the Chintamani,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
could be found in the
"King's Tower" in the center

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
of Shambhala, the
portal of the gods,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
hidden deep in the
Himalayan mountains which

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:84%
is seen here in one of
Roerich's paintings,

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
where we see the
fiery tower and we

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
see the figure with
the horse here,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
presumed to be Roerich who
has arrived at the King's

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Tower in Shambhala and
is now ready to receive

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.916 align:middle line:90%
the Chintamani.

00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
A story is told that
when Roerich reached

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the flaming tower in Shambhala,
that only his white pony was

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
allowed to enter the
portal of Shambhala

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:84%
because Roerich believed
he wasn't pure enough

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:90%
to enter this realm.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:10%
The white horse is then
a repetitive subject

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:10%
in many of Roerich's
paintings, including this one

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:10%
here, the White Stone,
also painted in 1933.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:10%
And we see riding upon
the horse in the flames

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:10%
is the Triple Dot symbol that
represents the Chintamani

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:10%
Stone, lending connective
tissue or corroborating evidence

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:10%
here that indeed it
was Roerich's pony

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:10%
that was actually
sent in to Shambhala

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:middle line:10%
to retrieve the Chintamani.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So here's the white
horse or white pony

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
carrying the Chintamani.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
This painting, called
the Treasure of the World

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
shows the Chintamani
placed on the white horse.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, this time, with
the flame coming out

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.380 align:middle line:84%
of the crown of
the sacred casket.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the very
same sacred casket

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that Wallace wrote to
Roerich about saying,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
"We await the casket, the
sacred most precious casket.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And we await the Stone."

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
The Stone, of course, is
kept in the sacred casket.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:10%
And what we see is that a sacred
blue halo above the casket

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:10%
warrants its powerful arrival,
watched by sentinels etched

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:10%
in the rocks that guard the
procession as the horse leaves

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:10%
the cave and descends
the mountain.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:10%
Interesting that this
electric blue light has often

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:10%
been mentioned by those
who have experienced

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.960 align:middle line:10%
near-death experiences, and the
opening of a portal or gateway

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:10%
into the afterlife.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Those practicing meditation
also experience it.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And this suggests that it's
a highly significant color

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
in bridging earth and
parallel realms in the cosmos.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And Roerich himself
must have experienced

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:90%
this electric blue light.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So could the tempura
blue that Roerich

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
has used in this and so
many of his paintings

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
represent a powerful gateway
or portal to Roerich?

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Can the painting
itself assist us

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
in transporting us
into this portal

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
as so many artists
proclaim images

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
can show us the way
into other realms?

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.340 align:middle line:84%
After six years of hard
and dangerous searching

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
for the Chintamani,
in 1928 Roerich

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:84%
was given the stone-- which is
equated with the Philosopher's

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Stone by the way-- by the
Abbot of the Trasilumpo

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Lamasery in Tibet.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Roerich had at last
reached Shambhala.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:10%
And in his paintings, he shows
these Buddhist ceremonies

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:10%
that take place in
these sacred locations,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.310 align:middle line:10%
maybe even a
recollection of what

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:10%
he might have seen in Shambhala.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:10%
On returning to the monastery
once again just before World

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.760 align:middle line:10%
War I began, Roerich
was given another stone

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:10%
by the Abbot responsible for
giving him the first stone.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So Roerich has a direct
and very compelling

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.210 align:middle line:84%
connection to the
Chintamani Stone.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And it must have
engendered great confidence

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
on the part of FDR that if he
dispatched Nicholas Roerich

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to Mongolia in search of
this stone for America,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that he would be
successful in that mission.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
In his published
writings, Roerich

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
notes that the stone
is, in fact, so powerful

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that it has to be stored
between two lithium pillars,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:90%
very interesting.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
There's many legends
about the Chintamani.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
stone was said to have

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
been sent from
Tibet to Jerusalem

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.803 align:middle line:84%
to King Solomon who actually
fashioned it into a ring.

00:20:33.803 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Hmm, now that's extraordinary

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
because Solomon is
said to have had

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of magical
capabilities,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:84%
including controlling
the djinns,

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:84%
or spirits that assisted
in the construction

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of his magnificent temple.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned,
the Chintamani is

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:10%
symbolized by three triangulated
dots in a pyramid formation,

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:10%
or triple dots.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:10%
And it's very interesting to
follow the triple dot symbolism

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:10%
throughout time.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
For example, Ahura
Mazda, the god

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of light of Zoroastrianism,
the religion of ancient Iran,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
has the Chintamani
on his cloak that

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.250 align:middle line:90%
is also covered with stars.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
This indicates
that this is a star

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:84%
cloak or a light-body garment,
and perhaps the Chintamani

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is a key aspect of this
light-body teaching.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
As we follow the
Chintamani, we see it

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in the detail here on
Ahura Mazda's cloak.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The Chintamani, again,
accompanying the stars.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We see it here on
the cloak of Hermes,

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.280 align:middle line:84%
the Greek god of Arcanum, who
also wields his Caduceus wand.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Hermes is known to have been an
inter-dimensional traveler as

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.405 align:middle line:84%
So by having the
Chintamani on his cloak,

00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
it indicates another
aspect of this teaching,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:84%
that it's fundamental to
traveling inter-dimensionally.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Mary also has the Chintamani
on her typically star-covered

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:90%
cloak.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
She has it again, here, in
this magnificent painting.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Mary wears the star cloak
with the Chintamani symbol

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:90%
as she holds Jesus.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And she's also in a
mandorla, or open gateway,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
filled with stars, again
connecting the Chintamani

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
with traveling into portals
leading to other dimensions.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:84%
Even Jesus has the Chintamani on
his cloak in this Resurrection

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:90%
image.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most
iconic image of Jesus

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
is this image here from
St. Catharine's monastery

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:90%
in the Sinai.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus gives this astounding
gaze or glance as us.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
But look at the book in his hand

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:90%
What do we see on the book?

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:90%
We see the Chintamani.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Is, in fact, the Chintamani
the Grail Stone itself?

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We have to seriously
question that.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And linking, once again, not
only Jesus but Solomon, Mary,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.284 align:middle line:84%
Ahura Mazda, Hermes, all
possessed the Chintamani.

00:22:59.284 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Centuries later,
the prophet Mohammed

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.171 align:middle line:84%
who was also named the comforter
received other fragments

00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:90%
of the Chintamani.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Nicholas Roerich
painted Mohammad on Mount Hira.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:10%
As he stands here on Hira, he's
standing before a radiant being

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:10%
presumed to be Allah,
but it could also

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:10%
be one of these other
dimensional beings

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:10%
who maybe even has now delivered
the Chintamani to Mohammed.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:10%
Solomon is a key
to Arcanum, and I

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:10%
want to focus on
Solomon's connection

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:10%
to Nicholas Roerich
for just a moment.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas and Helena's eldest
son, Svetoslav, also a painter,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
completed this painting
in Paris in 1923.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And it shows his
father as King Solomon

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:10%
before Nicholas departed
on his journey to India.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, this goes to the
mindset of Nicholas Roerich,

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:10%
that he's clearly
connecting himself

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:10%
with previous possessors
of the Chintamani.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Did he actually think he
was another incarnation

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
of King Solomon?

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Or did Roerich perhaps
believe that he

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
was continuing the mission
begun by Solomon around 950 BC?

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:90%
We're speculating here.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
fascinating to link

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Nicholas Roerich with Solomon.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Svetoslav was inspired by
his father's essay which

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:84%
is called Strings of Earth,
which was about Roerich's

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
desire to build a
unified temple on earth.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.240 align:middle line:84%
This would correspond with
the third temple of Solomon

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
in Christian prophecy, which is
thought to manifest at the end

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.150 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So here we have Nicholas Roerich
directly connecting himself

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
with Solomon and especially
the ultimate goal or mission

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
of creating a unified
temple on earth.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And with it, a New Deal for
humanity, a new Golden Age.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Some believe, of course,
that the Chintamani

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is the Grail Stone
that was placed

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
in the Ark of the Covenant
along with the other tools

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
or implements that completed
this kit, which included

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the Rod of Enlightenment, which
belonged to Aaron and Moses,

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the Flask of Manna, that
star food that we believe

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.040 align:middle line:84%
fed the light body and the
cruse of Anointing Oil.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:84%
While the Ark of the Covenant
was made or manufactured

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:84%
during the Israelites'
wandering in the wilderness,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:84%
it ultimately found
its permanent home

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
in Solomon's temple atop
mystic Mount Moriah,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
atop the Foundation
Stone in Jerusalem.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich was
assuredly well versed

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:84%
in these legends and lore
about the Chintamani.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And here we see Svetoslav
Roerich's painting

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
of his father holding the
sacred, most precious casket

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
containing the
wish-fulfilling jewel.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
During his travels
throughout Mongolia,

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Roerich is said to have followed
the symbol of the Chintamani,

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
which he saw painted on rocks.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Here we see a photo of
the Chintamani symbol,

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
the triple dot symbol,
representing the three

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
treasures of Buddhism
on Mongolian rocks.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:10%
This photo here
and these rocks are

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:10%
thought to be the inspiration
for Roerich's painting

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:10%
of the very same rocks.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the three
dots within a circle

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
appears in about 10 of
Roerich's known works.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
This painting is the most
official representation

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
of the most widely known
painting of Roerich's Banner

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
of Peace, which was his desire
to protect cultural locations

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:90%
and art works during war time.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And he intended
this Chintamani flag

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to fly above all sacred
spaces so that they

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.630 align:middle line:84%
would be preserved
during war time.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is the
logo of the Chintamani.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that the three
balls and a ring of eternity

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
are said to represent the past,
the present, and the future.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
In Madonna Oriflamma
from 1932, Roerich

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:84%
paints the Madonna holding
the Banner of Peace,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:90%
the flag with the Chintamani.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.805 align:middle line:90%
She also wears it on her crown.

00:26:56.805 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:10%
Roerich was a dedicated
activist for the cause

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:10%
of preserving art
and architecture.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.880 align:middle line:10%
He knew the value of culture.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:10%
He knew that if people
like Adolph Hitler

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:10%
got a hold of a culture's art
and were able to destroy it,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:10%
that they could effectively
cause that culture

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.779 align:middle line:10%
to cease to exist.

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:10%
It would just
disappear because there

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:10%
would be no artifacts left to
attest to that civilization.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:10%
And he earned several
nominations, actually,

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:10%
for the Nobel Peace
Prize, believing

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:10%
that peace through
international collaboration--

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:10%
especially among artists-- was
imperative for the survival

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:10%
of mankind.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful visionary.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Banner of Peace,
which was created in 1935,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.030 align:middle line:90%
was a result of this effort.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.820 align:middle line:10%
And here we see FDR
and Henry A. Wallace

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:10%
signing the Banner of Peace,
which is Roerich's greatest

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:10%
achievement in
many people's view.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.560 align:middle line:84%
The Roerich Pact, which
was signed by FDR and Henry

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Wallace in the
White House in 1935.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So what did Roerich
find in Shambhala?

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Signs of the Second Coming?

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Secrets of the Holy Grail?

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:90%
The Chintamani?

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Did he really return
the Chintamani

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to Henry Wallace and FDR
just before World War II?

00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Circumstantial
evidence says he found

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
something of immense
significance.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.950 align:middle line:84%
That evidence is on the
back of the $1 bill.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
In 1934, FDR ordered
the great seal

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
stamped on the dollar.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:34.440 align:middle line:84%
This was done at the request of
Henry A. Wallace and Nicholas

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Roerich.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
To the founding fathers, the
great seal of the United States

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
symbolized the
Eye of Providence,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
or divine intervention
in our world.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:84%
To Masons, it symbolizes the
fulfillment of the Great Light

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:90%
or the Great Work of Masonry.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:10%
To others, it signifies the
return of the light of Christ.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:10%
And while this symbol was
commissioned on July 4, 1776

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:10%
and designed under the watchful
eye of Benjamin Franklin,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.350 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Jefferson,
and John Adams,

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:10%
and ultimately
created in 1782, it

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.980 align:middle line:10%
was rarely used in
public until FDR

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:10%
made it one of the most
ubiquitous symbols in all

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:10%
of human history.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:10%
This tells me that
they found something

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.320 align:middle line:10%
of immense significance
in Mongolia.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.050 align:middle line:10%
And in my view, by placing this
on the back of the dollar bill,

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:10%
it was sort of like
running a flag up a pole.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It told those in the know-- read
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis--

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that America was
open for business

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
as far as this
symbolism is concerned.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:10%
America was ready to
open the new Golden Age

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:10%
and to fulfill the
prophecy of the ages.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to thank these three
wise men for providing us

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:04.120 align:middle line:84%
a window into the occult
history of not only America,

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:84%
but the occult history,
especially, of World War II.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a race between
two competing factions

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:90%
for these very same secrets.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, FDR, Nicholas
Roerich and Henry Wallace.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, Adolf
Hitler, Heinrich Himmler,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Nazis.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
completely unaware

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
of the occult significance
of World War II and the fact

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that these players
were so deeply

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:84%
steeped and aware of
ancient esoteric mysteries

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and the value of searching
for not only portals

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to other worlds,
but communicating

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:90%
with celestial beings.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
In the future, we have
to look to our presidents

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and wonder do they really have
the same level of understanding

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.110 align:middle line:90%
that these men had?

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Were they coming
from the right place?

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Were their hearts
in the right place?

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's only by attuning to the
highest aspects and the highest

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.860 align:middle line:84%
abilities within us that many
believe, including myself,

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that we will be able to create
the new order of the ages

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:90%
that so many desperately seek.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
us to do this, it's

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
going to require
many, many individuals

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000 align:middle line:84%
attaining this higher
inner consciousness,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
tapping the power of the heart,
tapping the power of the mind,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and setting their sights on
creating a new order that's

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.810 align:middle line:84%
based not on the love of power,
but rather, the power of love.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.494 align:middle line:90%
And that is Arcanum.

00:31:38.494 --> 00:31:40.382 align:middle line:90%

And now, in this segment
of Beyond the Veil,

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Clare's going to
introduce us to one

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful influences
on the life of Nicholas

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:90%
Roerich: his wife, Helena.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: As the saying
goes, behind every great man

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:02.610 align:middle line:84%
is a very patient woman who
holds the conductor's stick

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and orchestrates the
direction of the marital ship.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
introduce you to one

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.531 align:middle line:84%
of the most extraordinary
captains of her ship, Helena

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Roerich.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:10%
It was the influence of Helena
Roerich, whom Nicholas married

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:10%
in 1901, that really shaped
his career as an artist

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:10%
with a library of her
extraordinary literary works

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:10%
that gave him spiritual
direction both in his life

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:10%
and in his art.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Helena's creative works,
scientific essays,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and artistic writings were
formulated in their mystery

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.120 align:middle line:84%
school called Living
Ethics, or Agni Yoga,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:84%
combining East with West
and Heaven and Earth wisdom.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:10%
First in London in 1920 and then
in India, Helena and Nicholas

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:10%
were on a powerful quest
for the truth which

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.250 align:middle line:10%
was practiced and
left by the ancients

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:10%
towards spiritual
advancement and perfection

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:10%
of the human soul.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Roerich spent much time in India
with Mahatma's nameless Gurus,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:10%
Hermits, Rishis, and
Lamas, whom he often

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.000 align:middle line:10%
depicted within his art.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.065 align:middle line:10%
Nicholas and Helena were known
as Mahatmas, or great souls,

00:33:38.065 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:10%
and were highly revered
amongst their peers

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:10%
and often depicted
in his paintings.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Working with a unique group
of philosophers and masters

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:10%
and dissecting the
Indian spiritual culture

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and studying Shambhala,
the Jewel of India,

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:00.810 align:middle line:10%
Roerich firmly believed
energy exchanged

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:10%
within man interacted
with the planet, the sun,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.530 align:middle line:10%
and the mysterious
constellations of Orion,

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:10%
home of the Horsehead
Nebula and Sirius,

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:10%
the brightest star
in the night sky.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:10%
First discovered in
1888, one wonders

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:10%
if it influenced
Roerich's thinking

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:10%
when he painted the white horse
carrying the stone of Orion,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:10%
as the Chintamani was
called by Helena Roerich.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:10%
This breadth of energy,
Roerich believed,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.900 align:middle line:10%
reached them from
other worlds made up

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:10%
of matter of different states
of different dimensions,

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.929 align:middle line:10%
and that they reacted
consciously or unconsciously

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:10%
to this invisible energy that
penetrated their earthly lives.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Over thousands of
years, people felt

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.430 align:middle line:84%
the touch of these
invisible worlds

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but did not always understand
them for their own evolution.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Roerich felt that
denial of these worlds

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:84%
closed the path of
ascent for them.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:16.220 align:middle line:90%
But there was much more.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
In the accounts written
by Helena herself

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
in her many published
letters, she

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.070 align:middle line:84%
recounts a deep
underlying secret

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:90%
that the world was unaware of.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Only certain individuals
were aware of those very dark

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.685 align:middle line:90%
underlying secrets.

00:35:33.685 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
As Helena writes in
her many letters,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.530 align:middle line:84%
she mentions the importance
of the Rothenburg Casket,

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:84%
associated with Saint
Uta and the Uta Codex

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in Rothenburg, Germany

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and dating back to
mid-13th century.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Pictured here is Saint Uta
holding the Rothenburg Casket

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.220 align:middle line:90%
in this statue.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:10%
Roerich often painted Helena
as Uta holding the casket.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Sent to the Roerichs
in Paris in 1923

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
by an unidentified member
of a secret society

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped in a
pine box addressed

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:22.150 align:middle line:84%
to Helena via Banquers
Trust, its contents

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
were wrapped in a
cloth and embroidered

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:84%
with the IHS Christogram
of Jesus in a radiant sun.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Within the sacred casket
lies the Chintamani,

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:84%
the sacred stone known as
the Treasure of the World,

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:84%
the Lapis Exillis, the Holy
Grail, the Stone of Wisdom,

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and the Stone of Joy.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:84%
The Roerichs were painted
holding this casket.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
The 13th Dalai Lama decreed
that all such stones must never

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
again be allowed to
leave Tibet but remain

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:07.650 align:middle line:84%
hidden in secret
places for safekeeping.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, it would appear,
by Roerich's description

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of the stone that he received,
that it has been carved

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
or modified and one
of several stones.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Roerich associated the
Stone with atomic energy

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and believed that the power
of the stone, when held,

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
could dramatically
empower the recipient

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to create peace or
destroy the world

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and attain incredible
powers, which

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is why it was hidden
in the first place.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Whilst examining
the stone, Roerich

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
described it as a
form of moldavite,

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:84%
a magnetic mineral said to
be a spiritual accelerator

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.630 align:middle line:84%
or electrical accumulator,
with a faint inscription

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:84%
in Sanskrit upon which
is written the words "I

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:90%
bring the chalice.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:90%
Within it, I bring a treasure."

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The Stone is known as
the Treasure of the World

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
for this reason, the
Mongolian version meaning

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Naval of the World.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Helena Roerich named
it the Terafim,

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.725 align:middle line:84%
which in Hebrew
means the comforter.

00:38:21.725 --> 00:38:24.790 align:middle line:90%


00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Helena clearly
writes in her letters

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of the concern over the
fact that the Jesuits, who

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.190 align:middle line:84%
once owned the
sacred stone, were

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to retrieve
it from the Roerichs.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So much so, that in 1924,
they made an attempt

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to murder Helena in their
quest to recover the stone,

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:90%
but she evaded their attacks.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:54.080 align:middle line:10%
In 1929, Louis Horch built
the famous Master Building

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:10%
in New York for Roerich
to create an establishment

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:10%
for those wishing to
enhance their knowledge

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:05.300 align:middle line:10%
in esoteric knowledge and
placed his son, Frank Horch,

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.335 align:middle line:10%
as manager of the building,
which offered the first Roerich

00:39:09.335 --> 00:39:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Museum, incorporating
all his paintings

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:10%
as well as institutions
and apartments

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:10%
for rent for artists and
scholars of his work.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Master mythologists Manly
P. Hall and Joseph Campbell

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:29.890 align:middle line:90%
resided within the building.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Henry Wallace visited
Roerich there.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It is now known as the
Ghostbusters building,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:41.460 align:middle line:84%
as it was featured in the
movie The Ghostbusters.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
The Roerichs, in
1929, supposedly

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:84%
buried the casket and stone in
the cornerstone of the Master

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Building in New York.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
M.R., the initials

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
of Master Roerich, as
he was known in India,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.630 align:middle line:84%
encased in the Ring of
Eternity with the three balls

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.610 align:middle line:84%
depicting the symbol
for the Chintamani.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Interesting correlation
with these initials

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:90%
takes us back to Egypt.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.860 align:middle line:84%
M.R. also represents a
pyramid, a place of ascension,

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and also symbolizes Mount Meru.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.350 align:middle line:10%
An attempt to steal the
buried casket was made,

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.780 align:middle line:10%
and the manager of
the building was sadly

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:10%
murdered in the process.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:10%
Horch, shortly after
this mysterious event,

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:10%
went to great
lengths to dismantle

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:10%
the good name of
Roerich, culminating

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:10%
in the eventual
removal of Roerich

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:10%
from the building and the theft
by Horch of all Roerich's 1006

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:10%
paintings, books, and
valuable artifacts.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.810 align:middle line:10%
A court case ensued and
favored Horch, resulting

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.090 align:middle line:10%
in all Roerich's
belongings being

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:10%
gifted to the American
Nation by the judge.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:10%
Roerich then returned to India
to spend the rest of his life.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:15.650 align:middle line:10%
He continued to paint
until his death in 1947.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Roerich believed the
Himalaya Mountains in India

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
contain the Secrets of the
Agni, the divine fire, the power

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:84%
of thought being the most
powerful force in the universe

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred symbol of ascent,
which would be brought out

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
of the mountains to illumine
human consciousness in man.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.660 align:middle line:10%
Roerich places a
significant message

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:43.410 align:middle line:10%
in the symbology of his
paintings via the mountains,

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:10%
the water, the white
horse, and the Chintamani.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:10%
He suggests in his canopy
of ethereal mastery

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.160 align:middle line:10%
that the path of
the spiritual seeker

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:10%
is a hazardous journey, but
one that results in rewards

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:10%
that far outweigh the struggle.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.610 align:middle line:10%
We see, here, in this
symbolic painting

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:10%
called Burning of
Darkness, Roerich's family

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:13.250 align:middle line:10%
emerging from the cave,
each figure Mahatmas

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:15.920 align:middle line:10%
and dressed in white.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The master leads the way out
of the darkness of the cave,

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
holding the Rothenberg
Casket encasing

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the Chintamani, the sacred
fire, in the casket.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:84%
In the painting, Orion
and its constellation

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:84%
are clearly visible to the
naked eye, a sharp reminder

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
from Roerich that the message he
paints is cosmic and very much

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:48.430 align:middle line:84%
joining heaven and earth in
man's evolution on earth.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The sacred journey was
obviously made at night,

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.840 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing the
secrecy, sacredness,

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and of course privacy
of the mission, observed

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:84%
by the mountain sentinels
keeping a protective watch.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:84%
The picture is drenched
in the sacred blue light

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred
flame of the Stone.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.906 align:middle line:84%
What else did Roerich
learn from the Himalayas?

00:43:13.906 --> 00:43:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Another of Roerich's
masterpieces

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:84%
called Treasure of the Mountain,
and one of my favorites,

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:29.300 align:middle line:84%
holds the key to his message
for the world via his paintings.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Here we clearly see
the Pearl of Spirit

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:84%
captured in the
heart of the mountain

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and surrounded by powerful
and protective stalagmites

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and stalactites of
crystals encasing

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the illuminated gathering
in the distance.

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The real treasure lies
in the background,

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:57.020 align:middle line:84%
depicting depth, an
out-of-reach phenomena perhaps.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:01.140 align:middle line:84%
We see a vaulted chamber
with figures, Mahatmas,

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:90%
robed in white garments.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Included in these figures is the
artist, Helena, and her family.

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Notice the first three figures
are adorned with halos,

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:90%
suggesting holy connection.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The master leads the way with
a lit goblet in his hands,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by powerful Mahatmas.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:90%
The goblet is the Chintamani.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same
goblet, perhaps, that

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:84%
is held by Jesus,
symbolized in so

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:90%
many other religious paintings?

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:43.820 align:middle line:84%
The secrecy surrounding
the ethereal story

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.570 align:middle line:84%
here is, perhaps,
what the ancients

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
have gone to great
lengths to keep hidden

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:54.630 align:middle line:84%
over the centuries, information
that could have detrimental

00:44:54.630 --> 00:45:00.120 align:middle line:84%
consequences if in
the wrong hands.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.490 align:middle line:10%
He mastered the art of
using tempura paint,

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.310 align:middle line:10%
an egg-based medium
which dried quite quickly

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:10%
and was long lasting,
enabling the artist

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:10%
to attain an ethereal,
translucent light

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:10%
to his beautiful artwork.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians would
use tempura for

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:90%
their sarcophagi decorations.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Today we still see
the clarity of light

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that is so famously depicted
within the very fabric

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.245 align:middle line:84%
of Roerich's delicious paintings
years after completion.

00:45:33.245 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Yuri Gagarin, the
first human in space,

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:10%
described the incredible
gamut of rainbow colors seen

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.820 align:middle line:10%
from space through the
atmosphere of Earth.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Reminiscent of the paintings,
of course, of Nicholas Roerich.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:84%
This illumined artist,
who was captivated

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.895 align:middle line:84%
by the light in India
and embraced the strength

00:46:00.895 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and visions he attained within
the mountains in his search

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
for Shambhala, most of
his greatest spiritual

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.840 align:middle line:84%
works he painted in
the '30s and the '40s.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Clearly visible
in this painting,

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is the form of a face taking
center stage on this canvas.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.890 align:middle line:84%
In many of his paintings, one
can clearly see ancient faces

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains, often
Mayan, Mongolian, even

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.490 align:middle line:84%
those reminisce
of Easter Island.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:84%
These powerful sentinels,
carved in sandstone,

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:44.120 align:middle line:84%
always surrounding a central
theme of a cosmic nature,

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and seen guarding the secret
treasure of the mountains--

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
like Seraphim guarding the
gates of heaven, perhaps.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Roerich spent a period of
time in Arizona and the Grand

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Canyon, where he would have
acknowledged, in some depth,

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:04.410 align:middle line:84%
the majesty of the
mountains in all

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.250 align:middle line:84%
their glory and the
connection to man,

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:12.800 align:middle line:90%
the earth, and the cosmos.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:84%
As the world wakes
up to Arcanum,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:84%
this extraordinary artist, like
so many other great masters,

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:25.080 align:middle line:84%
is being recognized for the
powerful secrets he disguised

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:25.765 align:middle line:90%
and transmitted.

00:47:25.765 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Roerich has featured the
famous third-highest mountain

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:35.725 align:middle line:84%
range in the world,
Kanchenjunga in India,

00:47:35.725 --> 00:47:37.930 align:middle line:84%
in a large number
of his paintings,

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:43.980 align:middle line:84%
describing it as the five
treasures of the great snow.

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Once thought to mean
that gold and silver,

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:54.780 align:middle line:84%
gems, grain, and even the
holy books were found there.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:48:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The Roerichs believed that,
actually, this was not so.

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Sacred wisdom, they believed,
was the real treasure

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.720 align:middle line:90%
of the mountain, the terma.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.730 align:middle line:84%
The terma, the Tibetan
word for hidden treasure,

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.230 align:middle line:90%
plays a key role here.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Tradition holds that terma
may be a physical object

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:24.250 align:middle line:84%
such as a text, ritual implement
that is buried in the ground,

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:30.010 align:middle line:84%
rock, tree, or, in
fact, in the mind.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is
that man has always

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:38.040 align:middle line:84%
been captivated by the force of
energy that mountains project

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and often use them as the base
for the spiritual temples.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Here the face Roerich has
being cleverly disguised

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.580 align:middle line:84%
on the canvas and can be
rotated east and west.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Both directions
depict a hidden face.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:84%
What was he really
trying to tell us?

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.720 align:middle line:84%
What secrets did the mountains
in the Himalayas really hide?

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Roerich cleverly
unites the mountains

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:15.330 align:middle line:84%
with man and the cosmos time and
time again in his masterpieces,

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:18.460 align:middle line:84%
often depicting the hours
of darkness in the process,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.525 align:middle line:84%
and often with a face or a
figure to compete the message.

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:24.200 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It is true to say
that man has always

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:84%
had a lifelong fascination
with the majesty mountains.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:30.845 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:49:30.845 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich was one of
those rare artists of Arcanum

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:84%
who did know exactly
what he was painting.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And something the rest
of the world did not.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.500 align:middle line:84%
When one studies
his many paintings,

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.240 align:middle line:84%
it is impossible
to separate his art

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.860 align:middle line:90%
from his spiritual philosophy.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:59.342 align:middle line:84%
In "The Leaves of Mariah's
Garden," Helena wrote,

00:49:59.342 --> 00:50:03.360 align:middle line:84%
"Seek not for
waters in the sand.

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Ice is not found
amid sultriness.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:10%
The steepest paths
lead to the mountain."

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:10%
In one of their
treasured books called

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:10%
Fiery World is written
the beautiful words,

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:10%
"Only the hearts
whispers how it is

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:32.162 align:middle line:10%
possible to ascend to the
heights upon a polished stone."

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching Arcanum.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.460 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:51.367 align:middle line:90%
