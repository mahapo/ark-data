>>CLARE HENRY:
Since the 1960s, it

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:84%
has been proposed that the
ancient gods channel the stars

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:84%
in flying craft and that
the evidence of this

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.099 align:middle line:90%
is found in sacred art.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Are these ships warp

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
craft a la Star
Trek, flying saucers,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:90%
or could they be something else?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.076 align:middle line:84%
We'll find out
next on "Arcanum."

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: It has been proposed
that the ancient gods were

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
actually extraterrestrials with
advanced knowledge of science

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and engineering who
came to Earth to share

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:90%
their technology with humans.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.580 align:middle line:84%
These space travelers
voyaged the stars

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
in vehicles resembling
flying saucers.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Recollections of these space
beings and their spaceships

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:90%
are found in ancient artwork.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: It seems
possible, if not probable,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that Earth was visited by
extraterrestrial beings

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
This idea is
incredibly exciting.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: One of the
criticisms of ancient astronaut

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.540 align:middle line:84%
or ancient alien theory is
that its proponents believe

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing spiritual
about these ancient beings.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
They are simply beings
with spectacular advanced

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.085 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Many believe
there are star races who

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
travel the stars in
tin can spaceships.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:10%
We are on the way to
becoming such a race.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:10%
NASA has set a course to build
a warp drive within 100 years.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
This means the ancient gods are
less than 100 years in advance

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.595 align:middle line:90%
of where we are technologically.

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: However, the art
that we are going to explore

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
are illustrations of a far more
advanced and spiritual race

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:90%
and technology.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.804 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
masters of arcanum.

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:10.259 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: In these
examples, the heavens

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
open and beings
travel in whirlwinds

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and winged celestial
thrones and are actually

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
composed of an organic
spiritual material or light,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and so are the bodies of the
beings who ride upon them.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: This
spiritual technology

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
was called Merkabah mysticism
by the Jewish mystics.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The book of Enoch
was based on this Merkabah

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
or Merkavah mysticism,
a Jewish literature

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
associated with mystical vision
of the divine throne, which

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is envisioned as a luminous
cloud, chariot, throne vehicle,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
or Merkabah that
enables transport

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.445 align:middle line:90%
between heaven and earth.

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Merkavah means
throne chariot or sacred boat

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and refers to the craft
of Ezekiel's vision.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The kav element or kab
is the cab or car of God.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The goal of
the Merkavah mystic

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
was to transform into
light and enter the throne

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
world after passing
through 7 heavenly mansions

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:90%
or holes in space.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The highly esoteric
literature of these mystics

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
describes the journey to the
other worldly throne of God

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and their encounter with the
figure in the form of a man,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
as described in Ezekiel 126.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: William's
feature investigation

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
will explore this
extraordinary mysticism

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.114 align:middle line:84%
as we investigate the ascension
thrones of the ancients.

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:50.581 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Elias, the
Messiah's forerunner,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is a man to whom many
great mysteries of arcanum

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:90%
are attached.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
According to the book of
Kings, he raised the dead,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
brought fire down
from the sky, and was

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
taken up in a whirlwind,
either accompanied

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
by a chariot and horses
of flame or riding in it.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It is clear that Elijah
knew the secret of arcanum.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The chariot Elijah rode to
heaven is the Merkabah throne.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
In this Russian icon
of the fiery ascent

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
of Elijah to heaven from
the 15th and 16th centuries,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we see Elijah ascending in
his fiery chariot or whirlwind

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and transmitting his power
garment to Elisha, his priest.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, as Elijah ascended
in the Merkabah whirlwind,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
he did so in a form other
than a flesh and blood human.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
He appears to have
adopted a body that

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
could bend space
and time and also

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:84%
dematerialize and re-materialize
at another location

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:90%
or frequency.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
This special ability
is transmittable

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and is symbolized by Elijah's
pala garment or power

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
garment, which he transmitted
to his priest Elisha as he rose.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Is this an actual
physical garment?

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:10%
Or as we have proposed in
the "Cloak of Light" episode,

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:10%
is this a symbol for a
transmittable vibration

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:10%
or teaching that is symbolized
by a cloak or a garment?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.375 align:middle line:84%
In this northern Russian
icon of the ascent

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of Elijah from the
13th century, we

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
see the prophet
ascending to heaven

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.535 align:middle line:90%
in a cart drawn by horses.

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:10%
A fresco of Elijah from
the Rila Monastery,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:10%
Bulgaria, shows him
riding upon a chariot

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:10%
of fire drawn by horses.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:10%
It is common in eastern art to
see depictions of the prophet

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:10%
Elijah riding a flaming
chariot across the sky.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the
horses are drawn by

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:84%
an angel, symbolizing
heavenly power.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
In this example, we
clearly see the equation

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of Elijah's chariot
with the sun.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:90%
We clearly see Elijah ascending.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And we notice that
Elijah is aimed

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
at a portal or a gate
that is filled with stars.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Elijah's star chariot
drawn by horses

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
is often compared
to the sun or star

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
chariot of the Greek
sun god, Helios.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:10%
The horses that drew the
carriage were immortal and were

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:10%
said to have been born on
the Blessed Aisles, which

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:10%
were located in Elysium.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Helios's Roman
counterpart, Apollo,

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
also rides the star chariot.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The Helios symbolism
is also found

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
in a tomb under Saint
Peter's Basilica.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
This third-century painting has
been dubbed the Christ Helios

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and is thought to portray the
ascended Jesus riding the star

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
chariot through the heavens.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The fire of the
chariot of Elijah

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
is the same fire of the
many-eyed, red-winged, and

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
burning seraphim, the
highest order of angels.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Their whirling
vortex-shaped bodies

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
are composed of pure
love and pure light.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:10%
Beginning with my 2010
presentation, Soul Rising,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:10%
I have equated the seraphim
with the rainbow body beings.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:10%
The fire of the
chariot of Elijah

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:10%
is the same as the fire of
Moses's vision, the bush that

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:10%
did not burn.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:10%
It is the same fire that
guided as a flaming pillar

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:10%
the children of Israel through
the wilderness for 40 years.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:10%
It is the same fire that
protected Shadrach, Meshach,

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:10%
and Abednego from
the destructive heat

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:10%
of the fiery furnace
of Nebuchadnezzar.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
The book of Daniel says
these three wise men

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
entered this fire and emerged
with the Son of God in toe.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
This fire is the
brilliant light that

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:84%
guided the Magi across
the eastern deserts

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%
to worship the infant Christ.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The gnostic
revelation of the Magi

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
says the Magi weren't
following a star,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
they were following a
star man, a star child,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:84%
a man of light burning
with the fire of God.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:10%
It is the same brilliant light
that the apostles witnessed

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:10%
on Mount Tabor at the
transfiguration, which

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:10%
we explored in the episode on
the icons of transfiguration,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:10%
when Jesus demonstrated his
knowledge of the garment

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:10%
of light, which he
received during his baptism

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:10%
by John the Baptist,
who some claim is

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:10%
the reincarnated Elijah.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
At the transfiguration, Jesus
morphed into a light being,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
a cloud of light or fire that
resembles a portal manifested

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and is usually shown behind
him in transfiguration art.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, both
Moses and Elijah

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:10%
manifested on either side of
the cloud of light surrounding

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:10%
Jesus.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:10%
It is the light that blinded
the persecutor Saul on his way

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:10%
to Damascus, which led to his
baptism as the Apostle Paul.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:84%
In the vision of Paul from the
Acts of 20-- book of Acts 22:6,

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
he says, "About noon, as I
came near Damascus, suddenly

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
a bright light from
heaven flashed around me."

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Jesus manifests in a transparent
almond-shaped mandorla

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:90%
or gateway.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It is the same light
that surrounded

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Jesus when he
appeared to receive

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the soul of his mother, the
theotokos, at her dormition.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:10%
Elijah is prophesied to return.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:10%
The Old Testament ends with the
directly-spoken words of God,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:10%
"Behold, I will send you Elijah
the Prophet before the coming

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:10%
of the great and dreadful
day of the Lord."

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:10%
This implies that Elijah
is coming and going

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:10%
from the material to
the immaterial realm

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:10%
or that his soul will
reincarnate in a new body.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.780 align:middle line:10%
Elijah's fiery
ascension vehicle is

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:10%
identical to the chariot of
Kristo, Krishna, or Kristna,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:10%
the divinely conceived
Hindu lord of lords.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Hindus believe that Krishna
was the eighth avatar

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
or incarnation of the god
Vishnu, one of the Hindu

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.250 align:middle line:90%
deities in the Hindu trinity.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:10%
Hindu scriptures state
that Krishna appeared

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.530 align:middle line:10%
in all the fullness of
his power and glory.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
He was incarnate sometime
between 900 and 1200 BC,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
it is believed,
immediately following

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
the ascension of Elijah,
and his religious teachings

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the
Bhagavad Gita, one

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred texts in Hinduism.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Like Christ and
Elijah, Krishna is

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:84%
to return again as Kalki, riding
a white horse to do battle

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
with the prince of evil who
will desolate the earth.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The white horse is a symbol
for the Merkavah throne

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
upon which this
figure rises or rides.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Scholars document
over 100 similarities

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
between the Hindu and Christian
saviors, Krishna and Christ.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Some even propose Jesus is
a reincarnation of Krishna

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and is the rider of the
white horse of revelation.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Is Krishna also Elijah?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Krishna is a Sanskrit word
meaning object of attraction.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
"Energy flows where
the attention goes,"

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
says the metaphysical
law of attraction,

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and may be inferred here.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
According to the
law of attraction,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
we attract into our lives
whatever we focus on.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction
in quantum physics

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
shows us that all the
universe is made of energy.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
This includes both what we call
solid objects and something is

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
ethereal is thoughts.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that even
so-called solid objects

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
have a high percentage
of empty space in them.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:90%
They're made up of energy.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
The law of attraction takes
this fact into account

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and is a key to
Merkavah metaphysics.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Merkavah, or throne
chariot mysticism,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
is the earliest form of
Jewish esotericism known.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Its origins however can be
traced to ancient Sumeria.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
In Sumerian tradition, kingship
was first sent down to earth,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:90%
to man, from heaven.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:10%
The Sumerian kings list
composed around 2,200

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:10%
BC opens with the
line, "When kingship

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:10%
was lowered from heaven,
kingship was in Eridu."

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:10%
Kingship is symbolized
by a winged disk.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
This gives us one explanation
for the flying thrown.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It lowers and raises the King
between heaven and earth.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, the Sumerian king
list begins before the flood.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The early list names eight kings
with a total of 241,200 years

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
from the time when the kingship
was lowered from heaven

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the time when the
flood swept over the land.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And once more, the kingship
was lowered from heaven

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
after the flood.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
From this account, we once again
deduce that the king's throne

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.680 align:middle line:90%
traverses heaven and earth.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It was first lowered at the
beginning of civilization

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and then will also be
lowered once again.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
In his commentary,
so-called Sumerian seals

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
relating to gods
from outer space,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
or Anunnaki, Dr. Clyde Winters,
director of Nigeria's Uthman

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
dan Fodio Institute,
reacts to the possibility

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki
gods of the Sumerians

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
who brought kingship to earth
were extraterrestrials flying

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.930 align:middle line:84%
around in flying
saucers or rocket ships,

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
as ancient astronauts or ancient
alien theorists maintain.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
He provides us with an
enchanting but knowing reading

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
of this Sumerian
cylinder seal depicting

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:90%
the lowering of heaven to earth.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Says Winters, "In
the image, we see

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerian sign
of kingship, which

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:84%
is represented by the
figure, which is a star

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:90%
shape and include 16 points.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The dot reads 'lie,' and the
line is I. In Sumerian, lie I,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to become visible or shine,
is the interpretation.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Next, we see two gods.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:84%
On the left, we see
a humano-fish figure.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:84%
This god may represent the
god Enki, who was like a fish

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and is supposed to be
the creator of man.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
The other god may be
Enlil, his half brother.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
The hands of the gods
pointing to the log

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:84%
represent the signs i and ta
and reads, send forth his touch.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Between the gods and above
them, we see a log-shaped figure

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:90%
with a number of lines.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand
side of the log,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we see two signs that read,
'witness amazement.' And

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the log,
on the left-hand side,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
we see three signs that read,
'become a visible witness

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:90%
to benefit man.'

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Under the a sign, in
the center of the seal,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
we see a figure surrounded
by symbols that mean,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
'become visible and powerful,'
'nourish.' A third sign reads,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:84%
'send forth sustenance.'
These symbols probably read,

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
become visible, a
powerful leader or father,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to send forth
sustenance for mankind."

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Winter's reading
of the seal clearly

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:84%
tells us this seal depicts the
amazing and wondrous moment

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.470 align:middle line:84%
when the Sumerian
god Anu manifests.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:90%
We witness amazement.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Does he emerge from the
star or the starship

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
and unveil himself?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The log Anu is
riding upon clearly

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
reflects Merkabah
craft symbolism

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:90%
similar to Elijah's whirlwind.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendency among
ancient alien theorists

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to interpret this vehicle as a
hardware spaceship or a flying

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
saucer.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
However, we know the
winged disk, or Merkavah,

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
is a living organic vehicle,
not a flying Toyota.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
The being riding in it
is a being of light.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And read, in light of
Merkavah symbolism,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
this lightship of Anu
sends forth sustenance.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
The reason the distinction
is so important

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is because the organic
lightship concept

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
alludes to the
transformation of a human

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
into a light being as a
prerequisite for traveling

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
aboard this ship.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We see similar symbolism
in this Ashipu ceremony.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
The precept Enki,
clad in fish suits,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
flanked the radiant
tree of life.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
The Mullaloo, or
purifier, is the name

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
for this sacred tower and
the ringing cones emanating

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
The god hovers above in
the lightship, or Merkabah.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:10%
This Babylonian depiction
from the British Museum

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:10%
also shows the god in the winged
ring, or Merkabah, hovering

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:10%
above the radiant tree of
life, giving sustenance.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The priests hold pails
or so-called handbags,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
which contain either
tablets of knowledge

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or this nourishing
substance harvested

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:90%
from the radiant tree.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:10%
This Neo-Assyrian seal
from northern Mesopotamia

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:10%
in the mid eight to
seventh century BC

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:10%
shows a similar
motif-- A god riding

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:10%
in a winged or feathered ring
hovers above the sacred tree.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Once again, this is the organic
light vehicle, the Merkavah.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
A similar scene is presented in
an eighth century BC Assyrian

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
relief now in the
British Museum.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
The radiant or
zigzagy sacred tree

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
is flanked by a pair of
winged genii who carry buckets

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and what appear to be fir cones
used to sprinkle presumably

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:84%
water from the bucket
for purification.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Above the tree hovers a
winged lightship, sunship,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:90%
or starship.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
This ship represents the
royal god Anu from Sumeria,

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Ashur from Assyria, or Ahura
Mazda from ancient Iran,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
or the Assyrian equivalent of
the Babylonian god Markduk.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Turning to Iran, the
Persian god, Ahura Mazda,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
also flies on the
feathered or winged chariot

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
ring, the Merkabah.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The Faravahar, or
winged disk symbol

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:84%
of Ahura, whose name means
light, and Mazda or wisdom,

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is the omniscient and omnipotent
god of the Zoroastrians.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
He is shown holding the
ring of cosmic sovereignty

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:84%
while riding in
a feathered ring.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
It is associated with
divinity, royalty, and power

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Near East,
especially Egypt, Mesopotamia,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Anatolia, and Iran, and
has the general meaning

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
of guardian angel.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
The winged ring is
thought to represent

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
the divine royal glory of the
king in an Avestan language

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
word-- and is an
Avestan language word

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
for a Zoroastrian concept
literally denoting

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:84%
glory or splendor
but is understood

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
as a divine mystical force
or power projected upon

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:90%
and aiding the appointed.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:10%
In present-day
Zoroastrianism, the Faravahar

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:10%
is said to be a reminder
of one's spiritual purpose

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.750 align:middle line:10%
or mission in life, which
is to live in such a way

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:10%
that the soul progresses
towards frashokereti,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:10%
or union with Ahura Mazda.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:10%
In this scene, we see
a Neo-Assyrian feather

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:10%
robed archer figure
symbolizing Ashur

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:10%
that matches the Iranian
images of Ahura Mazda.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:10%
The right hand is
extended similar

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:10%
to the Faravahar figure,
while the left hand

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:10%
holds a bow instead of a ring.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:10%
In ancient Egypt, the
reassembled Osiris,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:10%
the god of rebirth,
renewal, and resurrection,

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:10%
was also shown seated on
a feathered, therefore

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:10%
flying, ascension throne.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
This symbolized
kingship and also

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Osiris's power of ascension.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
This makes Osiris's
throne equivalent

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
to the Merkavah throne chariot.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptian religion
is predicated on the belief

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that the deceased
could become a star

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and live for eternity with
the god sailing the Milky

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Way upon the celestial arc
of the millions of years,

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:90%
or the ship of eternity.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
In these scenes from the Temple
of Hathor at Dendera in Egypt,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
we see the celestial beings
are seated on feathered thrones

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
as they sail or ride
upon the arc of eternity.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
The shape of these
ships resemble in form,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and I believe
function, worm holes

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.090 align:middle line:84%
or dual-headed, inter-stellar,
or inter-dimensional

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:90%
transportation portals.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:84%
In this example, we see Sekhmet,
the lion-headed goddess,

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
sitting upon her
feathered throne.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:84%
She rides upon this
thrown into the stars.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we see two
gods riding together

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
upon the boat of eternity.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes there's more than two.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:10%
In this fantastic
example from the Temple

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:10%
of Ramses II at Abydos, the
great king sits upon his throne

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:10%
as he rides upon the
ship of eternity.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:10%
This is a powerful forerunner
to the Merkabah craft.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian pyramid
texts describe

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:90%
the process of ascension.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Rising from the sarcophagus,
the resurrected king

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
would make his way out
of the pyramid tomb,

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:84%
reading the text inscribed
on the walls on his way.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:10%
And they would assist him
in his transfiguration

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:10%
or spiritualization.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:10%
As the soul transcends the body,
it is reborn as a light being

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:10%
and enters a celestial
light resembling

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:10%
a hollow tube or tube of light.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:10%
It has entered a
wormhole and will now

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.680 align:middle line:10%
ride the boat of
eternity to heaven.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
In Utterance 216 of
the pyramid text,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
the king becomes a
flash of lightning.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
In Utterance 264,
the king ferries

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
across the sky to
join the sun god.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
All of the ascension
tools of the king,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
the boat or craft of eternity,
the feathered throne,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
the holy stick, and the key
of life were created by Ptah ,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
the god of technology, who
wears a multi-colored feathered

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:84%
ascension suit that resembles
the rainbow body of light

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:90%
in form and also function.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
He is also credited with
fashioning the bodies of men.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
he tweaked our DNA

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
to enable humans to more readily
make these ascension tools?

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's important to take note
that the feathered ascension

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:84%
thrones crafted by Ptah
for the Egyptian gods

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
are matched by the star
thrones of the Sumerians.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
The feathered or star
throne and the winged ship

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
go together in the
Sumerian tradition.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
In 300 BC, the Old Testament
god, Yahweh, the Lord,

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
was also presented as a shining
or luminous humanoid presence

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:84%
who sits enthroned on the
winged throne of glory,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
the luminous Merkabah
in the heavenly realm

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and in the temple of Solomon.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:10%
In this example from
the third century BC,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:10%
we can see that Yahweh's
wing-ringed throne is the same

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:10%
as Ahura Mazda's.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:10%
In his awesome vision of the
Lord's cab or car as a flying

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:10%
craft with wheels
within wheels, Ezekiel

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:10%
described the chariot
throne as alive,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:10%
meaning it's a living, organic
creature or living being.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:10%
The wheels were whirling
and sparkling yellow.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:10%
The Lord is enthroned on top
of this whirling vehicle,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:10%
and his throne is strikingly
similar to that of Osiris.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel's enigmatic
sky or star vehicle

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
has been misinterpreted as
a UFO or hardware spaceship.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:10%
It is clearly described as some
kind of living, organic being.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:10%
The wording of Ezekiel's
description of the living

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:10%
beings within the wheels
is enigmatic to scholars,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:10%
but it suggests the Merkabah
possesses consciousness.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:10%
One perspective is,
and their whole body

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and their backs and their hands
and their wings and the wheels

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:10%
were full of eyes, just like
the whirling or twirling

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:10%
bodies of the seraphim.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:10%
Another perspective says
the meaning of the word eyes

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:10%
is points of light.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:10%
This view leaves us
with the living beings

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:10%
of light on a throne that
is filled with light.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
In Ezekiel's vision, he
saw Yahweh, the Lord,

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
as a human figure sitting
on that throne of light.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:10%
And he was fiery or
filled with light.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:84%
"All around him was a
glowing halo, like a rainbow,

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
shining in the clouds
on a rainy day.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.100 align:middle line:84%
This is what the glory of
the Lord looked like to me.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:84%
When I saw it, I fell
face down on the ground,

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and I heard someone's
voice speaking to me,"

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
said Ezekiel in
chapter 1 verse 28.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
This rainbow being offered
Ezekiel an open scroll to eat

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and then told him to address
people who would not listen.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
After eating the scroll,
Ezekiel was lifted up

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:84%
by the glory of the Lord amidst
a rumbling sound as it rose,

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and he was taken to his people.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It appears Ezekiel is
describing the Lord

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:90%
as having a living rainbow body.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Further, those who
encountered this rainbow light

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
and ate the scroll
were transformed by it,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.810 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that
eating the scroll

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%
meant integrating or
becoming one with the Lord

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and gaining the ability to
ascend in the Merkabah craft.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
From Ezekiel's encounter with
the rainbow angel in the craft,

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
we may speculate that the
Merkabah craft and the rainbow

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.480 align:middle line:90%
body go together.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
In Claire's "Beyond
the Veil" segment,

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
she will take us deeper into
this Merkabah craft symbolism

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and show us how it was
adopted by Christian mystics.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:40.257 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:40.257 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Many do not realize
this Merkabah symbolism was

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:90%
adopted by Christianity.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
In ascension art,
it is Jesus who

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
rides the winged or
feathered sky throne.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The book of Hebrews
identifies Jesus

00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
as the high priest of
the order of Melchizedek.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:10%
As such, he would have
mastered the secrets

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon's temple,
especially those

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.760 align:middle line:10%
of the ascension
throne or Merkabah.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:10%
In this illumination
from a sixth century

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:10%
Syrian manuscript,
the Rabbula Gospels,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:10%
we see the ascension of Jesus
upon a feathered throned

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:10%
chariot, similar to the
one that Ezekiel saw.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:10%
As art historians note, a great
many Western ascension images

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:10%
adapt the pattern
seen in this image.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:10%
This became the common
way of portraying

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:10%
the ascension of Christ.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is in a mandorla or
rainbow ring on a wheeled

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Merkavah chariot, attended
by angels facing the viewer.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:90%
He holds an open scroll.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Below, the Virgin Mary
stands in the center

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:10%
flanked by two angels who
apparently are addressing

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:10%
to the apostles the
words in Act 1 verse 11.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:10%
"Ye men in Galilee, why stand
you looking up to heaven?"

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.940 align:middle line:10%
The Merkavah symbolism is
explicit in this ascension

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:10%
image from Macedonia.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:10%
Christ ascends to
the heavenly tsion

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:10%
upon a winged or
feathered throne.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:10%
Merkabah's symbolism is also
overt in Andreas Ritzos'

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:10%
"Ascension," in which Christ
ascends in a ring carried

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:42.860 align:middle line:10%
into the heavens by
feathered or winged beings.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
This scene precisely matches
the winged or feathered ring

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Babylon.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:10%
In this detail of
the cloud, we notice

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:10%
that it is lined with stars.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Manna or star food rains from
the underbelly of the cloud.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The pope can be seen harvesting
this extraordinary cosmic

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:11.250 align:middle line:84%
substance as it covers
the earth, the people,

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:90%
and the ground.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:19.450 align:middle line:10%
This manna or star
food comes from above.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.640 align:middle line:10%
Is it brain food?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:10%
Is it sound?

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:28.820 align:middle line:10%
And could this be the
cosmic Christ energy

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:10%
that is readily flowing over
the planet since the beginning

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:10%
of time and available
to man if he

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:10%
understands how to perceive it?

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Is this possible?

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The cloud is the bright
cloud manifested by Jesus

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
during his greatest miracle,
the transfiguration.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
During this event, he
transfigured or metamorphosed

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:90%
into a star man and back again.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Christian art portrays
the transfigured Jesus

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:90%
with a star-like body.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
A circular portal
behind him is referred

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:90%
to as a cloud in the Bible.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:84%
This is his ascension
and return vehicle.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:10%
Interpreting this craft
as a hardware spaceship

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:10%
or flying saucer deprives one of
a path of spiritual development

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.110 align:middle line:10%
and the recognition
that the Merkavah throne

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.115 align:middle line:10%
is something that can be
developed from within.

00:29:37.115 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
In Acts 1 verse 9,
Jesus was taken up

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.970 align:middle line:84%
before the disciples'
very eyes, and a cloud

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:90%
hid him from their sight.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
They were looking intently up
into the sky as he was going,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:30:01.560 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly two men dressed
in white stood beside them.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
"Men of Galilee,"
they said, "why do you

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:90%
stand here looking into the sky?

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
This same Jesus who has been
taken from you into heaven

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
will come back in
the same way you

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:90%
have seen him go into heaven."

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is routinely
shown in Christian art

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:90%
riding in a bubble of light.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:90%
He sits on an arch, his throne.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.190 align:middle line:84%
This bubble and throne
combination is the Merkabah.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The device beneath Jesus
is the etimasia, or throne

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:90%
of the second coming.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Christ's craft often features
the rotating ophanim or wheels.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Because they are
revolving, we may

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:10%
presume they create a
whirlwind or a vortex.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:10%
In the book of Ezekiel
and again in Daniel,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.680 align:middle line:10%
the ophanim were giant
eye-covered wheels

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:10%
of fire, which is why
they are sometimes

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:10%
referred to as wheels of
fiery flame and burning fire.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.279 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes they are shown as
red, but other times they

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:28.945 align:middle line:10%
are transparent.

00:31:28.945 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:35.820 align:middle line:84%
In this last judgment
or second coming scene,

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Jesus floats in a bubble of
blue light above that etimasia.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Looking closely, we see two
interlocking winged rings.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:84%
These are called
ophanim or wheels.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:84%
They are part of
Ezekiel's Merkavah throne.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
It is said they are the actual
wheels of Christ's Merkabah

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:90%
throne or celestial vehicle.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.665 align:middle line:84%
Their appearance
signals the crossover

00:32:06.665 --> 00:32:10.283 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish Merkavah
mysticism into Christianity.

00:32:10.283 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
We see the red-winged seraphim
guarding Christ's throne.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The winged seraphim
are sometimes

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:25.700 align:middle line:84%
shown standing on the
ophanim or hot wheels,

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
uniting the symbolism of
the whirling Merkabah,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:90%
the ophanim and the light body.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:10%
In this fantastic example, Jesus
is encircled by a rainbow ring

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:10%
as he ascends on
his throne, which

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:48.250 align:middle line:10%
is composed of winged
or feathered beings.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:10%
We note that his robe
is covered with stars,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:10%
and his feet are placed
within three rings, which

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.160 align:middle line:10%
also symbolized the
Chintamani Stone,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.390 align:middle line:10%
the wish-fufilling
jewel, the teraphim,

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:10%
or the treasure of the world.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:10%
Moscow's Tretyakov
Gallery is home

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:10%
to this image, the
"Trinity of Saints."

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:10%
Here, the ascended Christ sits
on the lap of the Heavenly

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Father, whose feet are on a
footstool with ophanim wheels.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:10%
In Andrei Rublev's stunning
icons of Christ in majesty,

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.040 align:middle line:10%
we see him enthroned with
his feet on the footstool.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, the ringed winged
ophanim symbolize the Merkabah.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Note that the throne
is transparent.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.690 align:middle line:10%
In the fourth century
in Egypt, Jesus

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:10%
was portrayed ascending
on a throne, actually

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:10%
the Arc of the
Covenant, surrounded

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:10%
by concentric rings that
form a tube of light.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:10%
The same motif is present here.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Jesus ascends on the throne
in a tube of light composed

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:10%
of concentric rings
filled with stars.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:10%
The presence of the
two guardian angels

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:10%
signals he is ascending on
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.600 align:middle line:84%
We can now appreciate
that the profile

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.800 align:middle line:84%
view of the Egyptian god on the
throne upon the celestial boat

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
was transposed into the
face on view of Jesus

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:84%
ascending on his throne in
the portal or tube of light.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Both images tell the same story.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
A celestial being is
ascending via the arc throne.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:10%
In this Russian icon,
the ascended Jesus

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.440 align:middle line:10%
sits on the lap of
the Heavenly Father

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:10%
in a bubble of fiery
light, encircled

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:11.130 align:middle line:10%
by a vortex of angels
or light beings

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.135 align:middle line:10%
whose bodies form a portal.

00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The ophanim wheels
are at his feet.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Here, a red-winged
Christ sits on his throne

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:90%
in a bubble of light.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, we
see this incredible art

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:84%
stretching over hundreds
and hundreds of years.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.090 align:middle line:84%
What else did these
artists really

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:84%
know about the ancient
secrets of long ago,

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic sap of Arcanum?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:84%
This bubble of light has an
interesting correspondence

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:84%
with a modern scientific
theory concerning warp drives.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:05.470 align:middle line:10%
The term warp drive was invented
by Gene Roddenberry in 1966,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:10%
when he boldly set humanity
on a course for the stars

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.730 align:middle line:10%
in Star Trek, allowing
the minds of man

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.810 align:middle line:10%
to venture further afield
in their consciousness.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:10%
In the series, the starship
Enterprise opens a warp tunnel

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:10%
and travels faster than
the speed of light.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Warp travel has long been
thought to be impossible.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:10%
However, like another Star Trek
invention, beaming or quantum

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:10%
teleportation, which
breakthrough science is now

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:52.050 align:middle line:10%
making possible, warp travel
is also within our reach.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Roddenberry's imaginative craft
inspired a young physicist

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:84%
named Miguel
Alcubierre to ponder

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:84%
what it would take to
actually make a warp craft.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:10%
In a 1994 paper titled
"The Warp Drive,

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:10%
Hyper-Fast Travel Within
General Relativity,"

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:10%
he envisioned a bubble
in space as a mechanism

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:10%
for getting an
object from point A

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:26.640 align:middle line:10%
to B at faster than light
speeds without running afoul

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:10%
of Einstein's law of
special relativity,

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:34.870 align:middle line:10%
which prohibits such travel.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, a physicist,
Miguel Alcubierre,

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
conceived a spacecraft
that could travel faster

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of
light and eat holes

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:90%
through any matter in its way.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Alcubierre realized
that for a spacecraft

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to travel faster than
the speed of light,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
it would need to somehow
create a warp bubble around it.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This would allow the
spacecraft to be contained

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.975 align:middle line:84%
within its own
region of spacetime.

00:38:05.975 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.690 align:middle line:84%
If the bubble can be controlled,
then the light speed limit

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
can be exceeded in normal
space, the spacecraft

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
itself would be stationary,
whereas the bubble in spacetime

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:28.710 align:middle line:84%
will zip around at
effectively infinite speed.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:10%
At the front of the
warp bubble, spacetime

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:10%
would contract, while
behind the bubble,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:10%
spacetime would expand--
a fractal of the Big Bang.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.940 align:middle line:84%
This rocking motion would
push the craft through space

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:84%
faster than the speed of
light, like a bobber surfing

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.860 align:middle line:90%
on a wave.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The ride would be
smooth, even though there

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:90%
is chaos around the bubble.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The ship is the still
point of the bubble.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:08.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the neutral point between
expansion and contraction.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.700 align:middle line:10%
In Islamic mystical tradition
is the concept of tayy al-Ard,

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:10%
or the folding up of the
earth, whereby a person is,

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:10%
without actually
moving, miraculously

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:10%
transported to another location.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:10%
The concept has been
expressed as traversing

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:10%
the earth without moving.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:10%
Some have termed it moving
by the earth being displaced

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.240 align:middle line:10%
under one's feet,
far-off destination

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:10%
by the world spinning very
rapidly beneath their feet.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:10%


00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.580 align:middle line:10%
The concept of Tayy
al-Ard has its roots

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:10%
in the following verses of the
chapter An-Naml of the Quran.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:10%
Quran 27, verse 38, "Solomon
said to his own men,

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.110 align:middle line:10%
ye chiefs, which
of you can bring me

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:10%
the throne of the Queen
of Sheba before she

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:10%
and her envoys come
to me in submission?"

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:10%
Quran 27, verse 39, "Said
an ifrit of the djinns,

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:10%
I will bring it to thee before
thou rise from thy counsel.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.480 align:middle line:10%
Indeed, I have full
strength for the purpose

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.680 align:middle line:10%
and may be trusted."

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Quran 27, verse 40, "Said one
who had knowledge of the book,

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:50.005 align:middle line:84%
I will bring it to thee within
the twinkling of an eye.

00:40:50.005 --> 00:40:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Then when Solomon saw it
placed firmly before him,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:01.980 align:middle line:84%
he said, this is by
the grace of my Lord."

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:10%
The account of
Solomon's coronation

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:10%
says the king sat on
the throne of Yahweh

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:10%
and was worshipped with him.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.820 align:middle line:10%
1 Chronicles 29,
verse 30, "Solomon

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:10%
sat on the throne
of Yahweh as king."

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.580 align:middle line:84%
NASA is presently funding
a prototype Alcubierre warp

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:90%
drive.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:84%
William noticed that
the proposed design

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:84%
for the Alcubierre
drive is strikingly

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:84%
similar to the craft
of Ezekiel, as rendered

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.320 align:middle line:84%
on the wall of Amiens
Cathedral in France.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:10%
The logo for NASA's
Eagleworks Laboratories,

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:10%
which is carrying out the
warp drive experiments,

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:56.380 align:middle line:10%
features a warp craft
entering a wormhole.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.630 align:middle line:10%
"Godspeed" accompanies the logo.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Godspeed, warp
speed, same thing.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:10%
The Eagleworks logo incorporates
artist Les Bossinas's depiction

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:14.350 align:middle line:10%
of a hypothetical wormhole
induction-propelled spacecraft

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:18.430 align:middle line:10%
based loosely on
the 1994 warp drive

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:10%
paper of Miguel Alcubierre.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.560 align:middle line:10%
The warp craft
enters a rainbow ring

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.585 align:middle line:10%
and travels to a distant galaxy.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:29.570 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.450 align:middle line:10%
Eagleworks' logo
features three symbols

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:10%
we have seen in a cartoon from
the Egyptian book of "Coming

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:42.890 align:middle line:10%
Forth by Day," in which the
bird-headed god Ra, the sun,

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.617 align:middle line:10%
rides a wormhole-shaped
ship of eternity, the sun

00:42:46.617 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:10%
boat or starship, into a
gate of stars, a stargate.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:58.540 align:middle line:10%
In both cartoons,
we link a bird,

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:10%
a craft capable of
traveling millions

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:06.100 align:middle line:10%
of years and a
portal or stargate.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.690 align:middle line:10%
This combination of symbols has
been in the human imagination

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.290 align:middle line:10%
for a very long time.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:10%


00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.990 align:middle line:10%
Ancient Egypt isn't the only
place that links the bird tribe

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:10%
and winged ring or craft
of the gods symbolism.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It also shows up on
the sixth century

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:30.700 align:middle line:90%
BC cylinder seals from Babylon.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.710 align:middle line:84%
In the example
below, the sun god

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Shamash hovers in the
winged sun disk throne.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.230 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
The humanoid Shamash
in the winged ring

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is an archetype
of not a prototype

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.900 align:middle line:84%
for a human being in a warp
craft with an outer ring

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of exotic matter that
can bend spacetime.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Jewish mystics called
this craft the Merkabah

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and describe its ability to
open portals-- so too is Jesus.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:10%
Arcanum humbly suggests that
the folks at NASA's Eagleworks

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:10%
can dramatically
increase their chances

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:10%
of realizing this extraordinary
starship dream by tapping

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.490 align:middle line:10%
the imagination
of the visionaries

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient
world and nurturing

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:10%
their minds with the symbolism
of the ancient light ship

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.930 align:middle line:10%
enthusiasts.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:10%
If they were to study Merkabah
or throne chariot mysticism,

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.750 align:middle line:10%
they would discover
a wealth of insight.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.650 align:middle line:84%
One may even venture to say
that for NASA to master the warp

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:84%
drive, they must first kick
in the spiritual drive.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.590 align:middle line:90%
