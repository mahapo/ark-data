00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
Mary Magdalene was

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.900 align:middle line:90%
the supreme initiate of Jesus.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Was she also one of
the most mysterious

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.310 align:middle line:90%
of all masters of arcanum?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE HENRY: Next on
"Arcanum," The Lost Secrets

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Ascension
of Mary Magdalene.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:38.587 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Said to
be a prophetess who

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
knew the all, a priestess
of Isis and Ishtar,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
a holy harlot who seduced
men from the Eastern

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and Western world, including
a messiah, a mother

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of future kings, and a
perfumer, Mary Magdalene

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
is as alluring as the
mare among stallions

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians' enemies
set loose in war

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
to drive the pharaoh's
stallions wild.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The source of
her power to captivate

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
is her refusal to
be put in a box,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
whether it be an alabaster
box, a prostitute

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:84%
box, a Christian box,
or a goddess box.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So in this episode,
we will search

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
for Mary Magdalene
outside the box.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Even
more, this episode

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
is a search for the lost
esoteric teaching of Jesus

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene, the
arcanum, which she taught,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and for which the popular
13th century French chronicler

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Jacobus said she earned
the distinction Illuminata

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and Illuminatrix, the
illumined and illuminator.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: As the Illuminator,
the Enlightened, Jacobus upholds

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene as illumined with
the light of perfect knowledge

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in her mind and illumined with
the light of glory in her body.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
In this case, glory describes
the splendor and bliss

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:90%
of heaven.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Glorify
means apotheosized,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to raise up, to make
one a god or goddess.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It also literally means to
illuminate, to give light,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:90%
or to glow rays.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Is Jacobus saying
that Mary Magdalene

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:90%
was an ascended light being?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Or that she knew the secrets
of the rainbow body of light?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: All the occult
mysteries of arcanum

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
speak of a key that is required
to unlock mystical secrets

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment and
the body of light.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The lost secret
of the arcanum this episode

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:84%
illuminates is about
building the light body

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
through the release
of secretions

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
from the astounding
manufacturing

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.885 align:middle line:84%
plant of spiritual
oils, the human brain.

00:02:34.885 --> 00:02:38.255 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The oil, or
essence, was the key secret

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:42.865 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene, and
is the key to arcanum.

00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
In William's
feature presentation

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
he will introduce us to be
ascension mysteries connected

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
to Mary Magdalene.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Mary Magdalene was
recognized by early church

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
fathers as the apostle
to the apostles,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
since according to
church narratives,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:84%
she was the one who stood in
the presence of the risen Jesus

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and went to tell
the other disciples

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:90%
the news of the resurrection.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Mary
says Mary Magdalene was

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:84%
given a special transmission
of knowledge, or gnosis.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
This transmission came
after Jesus' resurrection

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and concerned the
nature of matter,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
of salvation, and of the
soul's journey through darkness

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of the astral planes to
reach the realm, kingdom,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:90%
or empire of light.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:10%
A tantalizing reference to the
nature of Jesus' true teaching

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:10%
is provided in
the Pistis Sophia.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Jesus tells Mary, "Do not
see seeking day or night.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:10%
And do not let yourselves
relax until you

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:10%
have found all the mysteries
of the Kingdom of Light, which

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:10%
will purify you and make
you into pure light,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:10%
and lead you into the
Kingdom of Light."

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:10%
According to Jewish
legend, to make sure

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:10%
of the identity of
the Messiah, the Jews

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:10%
will demand that he perform
the miracle of resurrection

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:10%
before their eyes,
reviving such of the dead

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:10%
as they had known personally.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the Messiah will
do seven wonders, including

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
showing the three holy
vessels of the temple,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant,
the Flask of Manna,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Cruze of Sacred
Oil, all three of which

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:90%
disappeared mysteriously.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Also, the Messiah will wave the
scepter given to him by God.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
All of these tools are
mentioned as forming

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
the components of the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:10%
In the Bible, the
story of the Holy Oil

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:10%
begins with Moses
at Mount Sinai,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:10%
after he had received
the Ten Commandments.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:10%
He went up Mount Sinai
again, and this time he

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:10%
waited for six days
before entering

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:10%
the cloud of the
Lord's presence.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:10%
Moses received
detailed instructions

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:10%
for making the sacred
oil, but ultimately it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:10%
was kept in the Holy of
Holies of Solomon's Temple.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:84%
This oil went missing, along
with the Ark of the Covenant

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
kit of tools, in around 586
BC when the Temple of Solomon

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
was destroyed.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Jews believe these
items would be recovered

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
Messiah, The Anointed One,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and would be reassembled.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
When fully assembled,
the three holy vessels

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of the temple-- the
Ark, the Flask of Manna,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Cruze of
Sacred Oil-- form

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
a kit of tools known
as the Hetoimasia,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
or Throne of Christ,
as seen here.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the ascension
kit and the throne

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:90%
of the Second Coming.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Jewish tradition says Jesus'
brother, James the Righteous,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
was responsible for recovering
and assembling these tools,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
all save for one, the
Jar of Anointing Oil.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
This was saved for
Mary Magdalene.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:10%
Jewish Gnostics, who
recorded their beliefs

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:10%
in the Gospel of Philip,
say the Magdalene Sacred

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:10%
Oil is called Chrism, and that
it produces the resurrection.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And it says the Chrism
is superior to baptism,

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
for it is from the word Chrism
that we have been called

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Christians, certainly not
from the word baptism.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is because of the Chrism
that the Christ has his name.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
This oil opened
one's spiritual eyes,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:90%
but it may have done more.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Isiah said the
Anointed One received

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit,
symbolized by a dove.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
In Gustave Moreau's painting,
we see Mary Magdalene

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
cradling Jesus, perhaps in
the moment after she anointed

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
his body with the sacred oil.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:84%
A version of Enoch's
metamorphosis,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
given in The Book of
the Secrets of Enoch,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
explicitly describes the
transformation of Enoch as one

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
which blurs the boundaries
between human and angelic

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
experience, and indicates
he achieved the rainbow

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
body of light from
this sacred oil.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said to Michael,
"Take Enoch and strip him

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of this Earthly garments, and
anoint him with the holy oil,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and clothe him in
garments of glory.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And Michael stripped
Enoch of his garments

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:90%
and anointed him with this oil.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And he looked upon
himself and saw

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that he was one of the
Glorious Ones, or Perfect Ones,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
difference, and all

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
his fear and
trembling left him."

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Second Enoch portrays
the archangel Michael

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:84%
extracting Enoch
from his clothes

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:90%
and anointing him with an oil.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And the anointing
with shining oil

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.280 align:middle line:84%
causes Enoch's transformation
from a mortal human

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
to the luminous garment of an
immortal angelic being, one

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Glorious Ones.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
to Jesus as well.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:10%
This is the purpose of the
Chrism, or anointing oil,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:10%
in Mary Madeleine's
alabaster jar.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:10%
And this is what we see
featured in depictions

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:10%
of Mary Magdalene, including
this notable version by Roger

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:10%
van der Weyden.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:10%
In another example,
this one by Correggio,

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:10%
which is very gentle,
we see Mary Magdalene

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:10%
reading with her jar beside her.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:10%
John Hey shows her with a
jewel radiating on her crown,

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:10%
radiating light.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.410 align:middle line:10%
In Bernardino Luini's
version of it,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:10%
we see a black mirror on Mary
Madeleine's heart chakra.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:10%
All of these images
are reminiscent

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.519 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient goddess Ishtar,
or Mari, holding a water

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:10%
vase from 2,300 BC.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.339 align:middle line:84%
Some believe the Magdalene was
a priestess of Ishtar, or Mari,

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and might have learned the
secrets of the alabaster jar

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:90%
from her.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The crucifixion took
place at Golgotha,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:90%
the place of the skull.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
In this example by
an unknown artist,

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
we see a mysterious face
on Mary Magdalene's jar.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:10%
This is one reason why the skull
is present at crucifixion art.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:10%
But there is another,
deeper reason.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Georges La Tour's
"Penitent Magdalene"

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
depicts her in a dramatic
moment of contemplation.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It is loaded with
arcanum symbolism.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The Metropolitan
Museum of Art Guidebook

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
says the elaborate silver
mirror symbolizes luxury,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
while the self-consuming
candle reflected

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
in it suggests the
frailty of human life.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:10%
The skull upon which
her clasped hands rest

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:10%
may stand for peaceful
acceptance of death.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:10%
However, in religious
symbolism, the candlestick

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:10%
is the symbol of
spiritual illumination,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:10%
of the light, and of the
seed of life and salvation.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
In Christian symbolism, it
is the divine light shining

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
into the world, and Christ
as the light of the world.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:10%
These suggest Jesus' words,
"I am the light of the world."

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:10%
De La Tour's "Magdalene
with the Smoking Flame"

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:10%
once again emphasizes
Mary Magdalene

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:10%
in a meditative state.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:10%
The skull on her
lap is interesting.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a protective box
for the brain, eyes,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:90%
and hearing organs.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the cup of
life, the grail that

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
catches the secretions
from the brain.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Without the key
vibrating in our brains

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and radiating
throughout our bodies,

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:84%
no one can gain the higher
knowledge of the gods.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
The polished skull and
leather books are repeated,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:84%
but the emphasis
is on the candle.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:84%
The LA County
Museum of Art Guide

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
says it emits the light
that the followers of Saint

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
John of the Cross called
The Living Flame of Love,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
towards which the spiritual
pilgrims are drawn out

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:90%
of the dark night of the soul.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene anointed, or is it
embalmed, Jesus in the tomb

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.220 align:middle line:90%
after the crucifixion.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Mark 16:1 reads, "When
the Sabbath was over,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene and Mary, the
mother of James and Solome,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
bought spices so that they
might come and anoint him."

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Very early on, the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:10%
when the sun had risen.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:10%
In Roger van der
Weyden's "Pieta,"

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene kneels in
veneration at Christ's feet.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Alongside her, an ointment
pot, her customary

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:90%
attribute containing the Chrism.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
The skull in the
foreground symbolizes

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.670 align:middle line:84%
the location, Golgotha,
literally the place

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:90%
of the skull.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:10%
In John and Hubert
Van Eyck's rendering,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:10%
we see the Angel of the
Lord, a watcher on the tomb.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:10%
Three women stand
by the empty grave,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:10%
and the angel tells
them what has happened.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:10%
Christ has risen from the grave,
the guards are sound asleep,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:10%
and the women carry bottles
with ointment and spices

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:10%
to tend to the body of Christ.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
In the background is
the city of Jerusalem.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Luke identifies the women
as Mary Magdalene, Joanna,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and Mary, mother of James, and
adds two men standing by them

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
in shining garments.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.090 align:middle line:10%
In Fra Angelico's
"Resurrection of Christ

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:10%
and the Women at the Tomb,"
we see the three Marys

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:10%
at the empty tomb.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:10%
If Mary Magdalene anointed
Jesus with the resurrection oil,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:10%
as we're told, his
translation into a light being

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:10%
would not have been a surprise,
as the Bible proposes.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It would have been the expected
outcome of this ceremony.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
The Chrism would have dissolved
his body into glorious light,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
a transformation beautifully
visualize by William Blake.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Contemplate this moment
as Blake shows us the

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
risen Jesus as a light
being, perhaps being

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:90%
transformed by the Chrism oil.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
This event is even
more spectacularly

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:84%
shown by William
Holman Hunt, who

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
shows the rainbow body around
Jesus' resurrected body.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:10%
Andrea Mantegna's
astounding painting

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:10%
shows a radiant Christ
stepping out of his grave,

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:10%
surrounded by angels.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:10%
In his left hand he holds
the flag of the Crusaders.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:10%
Around his body we see
the radiant angels,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:10%
producing an illuminating
fire around his body.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
the radiant Christ

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the cave
as a victorious being.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is shown in this
Coptic Egyptian version, where

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus rises from the
grave, or the tomb,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:90%
as a radiant light being.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The motif of anointing
with oil looms

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
large in ancient Judeo-Christian
tradition, especially the lore

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of Adam and Eve.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:84%
In a Gnostic tale, Adam is
in great pain, near death.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
He sends Seth to
the Garden of Eden

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to fetch the oil from
the Tree of Life.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
archangel Michael

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
refuses to give him
the oil, telling Seth

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that the oil will be
used in the end times

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
for those who will be worthy
of entering the Garden.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The oil will be used to
transform, or to assist,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
in the transition
of the righteous

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:90%
into celestial beings.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The oil will be used
in the end times

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
for those who will be worthy of
entering the garden, or Scion.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the story,
we're told, it is

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
likely to rays of
the glittering sun.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:84%
This returns us to the
subject of Pentecost,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
discussed in the "Akhenaten
and the Holy Light" episode.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
At Pentecost, the
disciples gathered

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.650 align:middle line:84%
in the upper room,
the brain, where

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
they were anointed by the divine
fire frequency, or vibration,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Spirit.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:10%
In the images of Pentecost,
the ascended Jesus

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:10%
transmits the Holy
Spirit to the disciples

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:10%
from the cosmic realms.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:10%
He sprays gleaming
rays of light.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
This is strikingly similar
to the anointing of the Aton

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:90%
by Akhenaten.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:10%
Is this a coincidence?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Or, does it uphold the
connection between the Essenes

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:10%
and the religion of the disk,
as we explored in that episode.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Does this art
portray the Essenes

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in the arms, or hands,
of the holy light?

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:10%
Nefertiti offers an
alabaster jar to the Aton.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:10%
Is this the same alabaster
jar of Mary Magdalene,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:10%
which contains the Chrism,
the resurrection oil?

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:10%
A provocative theory concerning
Mary Madeleine's anointing

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:10%
of Jesus claimed
she was performing

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.710 align:middle line:10%
an ancient Egyptian ceremony
of anointing kingly candidates

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:10%
in order to enhance
their physical powers

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:10%
and protect them from
danger and increase

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:10%
their connection to God.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Was this the ceremony
that Mary Magdalene

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:90%
performed in the tomb of Jesus?

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
that Mary Magdalene

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
learned the secrets
of the Aton and how

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:90%
to become one with the sun?

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
According to legend, after
Christ's resurrection

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
from the tomb, Mary Magdalene
moved to Southern France

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
where she lived in a cave
as a hermit, at Saint Baume,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:90%
near Aix-en-Provence.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:10%
There, she was transported
seven times a day

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:10%
by angels into the
presence of God,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:10%
where she heard,
with her bodily ears,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:10%
the delightful harmonies
of the celestial choirs.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:10%
This unusual, nude
figure in the Louvre

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:10%
represents Mary Magdalene
as a mystic ascetic.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And according to legend, when
the repentant Magdalene lived

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:10%
in the cave, she was
clothed only by her hair.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:10%
Every day she was
raised up in the sky

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:10%
by angels to hear
the heavenly chorus.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:10%
This statue appeared on
the German art market

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.710 align:middle line:10%
in the 19th century, and
was purchased by the Louvre

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.801 align:middle line:10%
in 1902.

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We see the same long hair
motif in these scenes, where

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene is
ascending to Heaven

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:90%
in the company of angels.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:10%
The angels actually form a
twirling whirlwind, or Merkaba,

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:10%
around her hair covered body.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:10%
And as they lift her
into the heavens,

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:10%
she is ascending into the
heavens as a transformed being.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the most
striking example

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:10%
of the Magdalene
covered with hair

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:10%
is found in Botticelli's "The
Trinity With Saints" altarpiece

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:10%
from 1491.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:10%
This painting is part of
an altarpiece commissioned

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:10%
for a convent for
repentant prostitutes,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:10%
called Saint Isabelletta
Del Converte, in Florence.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:10%
Today, it's in London's
Courtauld Gallery.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:10%
In the center is a vision
of the Trinity, God

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:27.260 align:middle line:10%
the Father, a dove
symbolizing the Holy Spirit,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:10%
and Christ on the Cross.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Flanking this
surprising apparition

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
are John the Baptist,
patron Saint of Florence,

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene,
patroness of the convent.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Mary is clothed by her
hair, and John wears fur,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:84%
recalling the time both saints
spent in the wilderness,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.706 align:middle line:84%
says the Courtauld
Gallery website.

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Could the hair and
fur actually be

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:90%
a reference to something else?

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even and ascension suit?

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Artists depict Mary ascending
into the divine presence

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
with long hair, and through
multi-colored clouds

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:90%
accompanied by angels.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The cloud is, of
course, a reference

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%
to the Merkaba throne.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:10%
In this example, by
Giattao, the angels

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:10%
lift Mary Magdalene to Heaven
on the multi-colored Merkaba

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:10%
throne chariot
that is strikingly

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:10%
similar to the
winged ring of Jesus.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:10%
Taddeo Crivelli
shows the Magdalene

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:10%
with her hair covered
body, once again,

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:10%
and standing on a whirling
vortex composed of angels.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So here she is ascending
into the heavens

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
on this whirling vortex
of angelic energy.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:10%
In the early 1500s,
German artists

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:10%
produced a series of depictions
of the ecstasy, or ascension

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:10%
of Mary Magdalene,
covered with hair.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Other versions show her
covered with feathers

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:10%
that resemble fur.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:10%
It is believed that
this practice arose

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:10%
from medieval liturgical
dramas and mystery

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:10%
plays, in which the
actors portraying angels

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:10%
wore garments covered
with feathers to emphasize

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:10%
their power of flight.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, the angels lift Mary
Magdalene in a twirling vortex.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's safe to say this flight is
not to a physical destination,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:84%
rather it is to a
metaphysical one.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But what is the meaning of
this strange looking fur?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:10%
In my view, interesting
insight into this question

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:10%
comes from the Egyptian
images of Ptah,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:10%
the god of smithcraft
and arcanum, who is also

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:10%
shown with his body
covered with feathers,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:10%
or wearing a feather
suit of many colors.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, the Egyptian
god of resurrection,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
also wears one of
these feather suits.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Ptah's ascension suit and
Osiris' is strikingly similar

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
in appearance, and
possibly function,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:90%
to the rainbow body of light.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Could there in fact
be a deep connection

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:84%
between Mary Magdalene's suit,
the feathered ascension suit

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of Ptah and Osiris,
and the rainbow body?

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Inspiration for these
paintings, titled

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
"The Ecstasy of Mary
Magdalene," come

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
from to Jacobus de
Voragine's book of saints,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
entitled The Golden Legend, in
which it's written, "the saint,

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:84%
desiring to contemplate
celestial things,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
withdrew into a
mountain cave, which

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
had been prepared by
the angels' hands.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And there she remained for 30
years, unknown to everyone.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Every day, the angels lifted her
into the skies, and for an hour

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
she heard the celestial
music, after which,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.290 align:middle line:84%
replete with this
delicious meal,

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:84%
she re-descended into her
cave and had not the slightest

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:90%
need for bodily ailments."

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The Oxford English Dictionary
records extasis transforming

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.030 align:middle line:84%
in meaning in late Greek,
becoming "withdrawal

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of the soul from the body,
mystic, or prophetic trance."

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:10%
Particularly among
medical writers,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:10%
ecstasy was used
interchangeably with trance.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:10%
The art historian
Bedoyan points out

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:10%
that ecstasy, which
transfigures Mary Magdalene,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:10%
is surprisingly reminiscent
of the detailed descriptions

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:10%
of the ecstasy of the Spanish
Saint Theresa of Avila.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:10%
Caravaggio's painting
of Magdalene in ecstasy

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:10%
was immensely influential for
future treatment of the theme

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.410 align:middle line:10%
by artists, such as
Rubens and Simon Vouet.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
She is in full bliss, connected
to the Heavenly realms.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:10%
The setting for Peter
Paul Rubens' painting

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:10%
of Magdalene's ecstasy
is a rocky mountain

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:10%
ledge at the mouth of a cave.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Rubens conveys a deep
mysticism in this painting.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Note the empty jar
beside Mary Magdalene.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Is this the source
of her ecstasy?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Could this be the Chrism?

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Look at the expression
on Mary Madeleine's face.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Her eyes are slightly open
but appear somewhat lifeless.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Her face and upper
body have been lit up

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
by a shaft of light,
and she appears

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:90%
to be in a trance-like state.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:10%
"To love God with
all your soul,"

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:10%
wrote Paramahansa
Yogananda, "means

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:10%
to enter the state of
super conscious ecstasy,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:10%
direct perception of the soul,
and its oneness with God."

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the realization of the
soul as the reflection of God,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
the soul's connection with
the consciousness of God.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
"To love God with all the soul
requires the complete stillness

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.890 align:middle line:84%
of transcendent
interiorization," he wrote.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:10%
Finally, from Assisi,
Italy, we see Mary Magdalene

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:10%
receiving her cloak of light
from the alchemists Zosimus.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Her ascension is complete.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
In Clare's Beyond
the Veil segment,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
she will show us the further
connection between Mary

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene and the ascension
and Merkaba mysteries.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: According to second
century Gnostic Christian

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:84%
belief, recorded in
the Gospel of Mary,

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and recovered in
the 20th century,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene received a
special revelation, perhaps

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
a blessed flash of
illumination from Jesus

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that was hidden from
the other apostles.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Jane Schaberg, professor of
Religious Studies and Women's

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:10%
Studies at the University
of Detroit Mercy,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:10%
provides one of the most
interesting insights

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.125 align:middle line:10%
into Mary Magdalene in her
book, The Resurrection of Mary

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Magdalene.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
She notes that
Migdal, or Magdala,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
has a very high place in
women's mystical and literary

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
traditions for its connection
to the daughters of Job,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
who died there.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The story of Job's
daughters reveals

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:84%
ancient Magdala had an
otherworldly connection.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as a
literary reference,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Magdala may have meant something
like Wonderland or Oz means

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Specifically,
Magdala was involved

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:84%
with Merkaba, or throne
chariot mysticism.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
This Jewish mysticism focuses
on the transformation of humans

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
during a journey to the
throne chariot of God.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
This tradition is
recorded in the testament

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of Job, a first century
Gnostic document.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:10%
This story is
utterly fascinating.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:10%
In the opening of
the testament of Job,

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:10%
the patriarch is feeling ill.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:10%
Perceiving that his
stewardship was nearly over,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:10%
Job gathered his daughters.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:10%
In all the land, there
were no women so beautiful

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:10%
as Job's daughters,
says the Book of Job.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:10%
He called his first
daughter and said to her,

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:10%
"Take this signet ring,
go to the chamber,

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:10%
and bring me the
three golden boxes,

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:10%
so that I may give
you an inheritance."

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And she went away and
brought them to him.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.780 align:middle line:84%
He opened them and bought
forth three bands shimmering,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
so that no man could describe
their form since they

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
are not from Earth,
but from heaven,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
flashing with bright sparks
like rays of the sun.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.550 align:middle line:84%
One of Job's daughters
complains that "this

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:84%
isn't much by way
of inheritance.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:84%
We won't be able to sustain
our life from them, will we?"

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.910 align:middle line:90%
she asks.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And Job replied to them, "Not
only will you sustain life

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
from these, but
these bands will also

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:08.010 align:middle line:84%
lead you into the better
world to live in the heavens."

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:10%
In fact, according to Job,
the Lord gave him these cords.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.520 align:middle line:10%
When Day put on the cord,
she went out of her body,

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:10%
put on a new heart, and never
again cared for Earthly things.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Then she sang angelic hymns
in the language of the angels.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Her sister's heart
was also transformed

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:90%
the moment she put on the sash.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:84%
She, too, no longer
wished for worldly things.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:10%
And when she opened
her mouth, she suddenly

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:10%
spoke the language of
the rulers, or Archons.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:10%
Taking a moment to familiarize
ourselves with the Archons

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:10%
will be invaluable
in helping us to go

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:10%
beyond the veil of this
story, and to reveal

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:10%
the knowledge possessed
by these women of wisdom.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Some believe they are the same
as the ancient alien beings,

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:10%
known as Malachim,
in ancient Iraq.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:10%
The hypostasis of the Archons
says the evil Archons clothed

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:27.550 align:middle line:10%
man in a material body,
a casket, or tomb.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:10%
The Archons contrived
to keep Adam and Eve,

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:10%
along with their divine
particles, trapped in matter,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:10%
enslaved forever in the
wheel of reincarnation,

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:10%
as tillers of the
Garden of Eden.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:10%
In this way, humans
served the Archons.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:10%
The hypostasis also
describes a veil

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:57.290 align:middle line:10%
that exists between the world
above and the realms below.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
In the first
Apocalypse of James,

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Jesus says the Archons are
like toll collectors who

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:84%
seek to take, by theft,
our divine spark.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
"They are not entirely
alien," say the Gnostics,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
First Apocalypse of James,
"they are from Achamoth.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And these she produced as
she brought down the race

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.080 align:middle line:90%
from the Pre-existant One."

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.700 align:middle line:84%
This spirit was known as the
divine particle, or divine

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.412 align:middle line:90%
embryo.

00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
As the Gospel of Judas
tells us, the Savior

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was considered a
divine particle that

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
was clothed in
the body of Jesus.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Gospel of Judas,

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
the Savior is the divine
spark, the spiritual being

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
inside Jesus, who lives
in a spiritual dimension.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
The physical being of
Jesus is a simple covering,

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.760 align:middle line:84%
much like a clothing
that the spiritual Savior

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.670 align:middle line:90%
wears in the world.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:10%
The language of
the angels is also

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.020 align:middle line:10%
called the language
of the birds,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:10%
likely because the
Latin "ave," or bird,

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.184 align:middle line:10%
is phonetically
the same as "ave,"

00:29:22.184 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:10%
angel; "ave," apple, the
symbol forbidden knowledge;

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:10%
and "ova," meaning life.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:10%
The alchemist Falconelli calls
it the language of the gods.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.440 align:middle line:10%
He claims it was knowledge
of this language which Jesus

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:10%
revealed to his
apostles by sending them

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:10%
his spirit, the Holy Ghost.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
One wonders if it is
even remotely possible

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that Mary Magdalene
knew this language.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.110 align:middle line:84%
As documented by
the Gnostic gospels,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
she certainly behaved
as a woman from Migdal.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.370 align:middle line:84%
That is, she knew how
to evade the Archons

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and go beyond the veil.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:84%
In addition to speaking the
language of the Archons,

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Job's second
daughter sang hymns.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.090 align:middle line:84%
When she sang her hymns, the
testament of Job tells us,

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
they were loaded with
insight into the workings

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:90%
of the heavens.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The same singing and speaking
the language of the angels

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.080 align:middle line:84%
happened when Job's
third daughter, Amalthea,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:90%
put on the sash.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:45.200 align:middle line:10%
Not only could Job's
daughters speak the language

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:10%
of angels, what is more,
they could see and celebrate

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:10%
the whirlwind, our
heavenly chariot, that

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:10%
came for the soul of Job.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.650 align:middle line:10%
This is the Merkaba ascension
throne of Jewish mysticism.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Is the book of Job,
and the testament

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:10%
of Job's account of these three
women of Magdala, a true story?

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:10%
Or is it a lesson
meant to implant

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:10%
the idea of the language
of the angels at Magdala,

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.400 align:middle line:10%
and to connect Mary
Magdalene to it?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:10%
Was Magdala a prototype
for Wonderland or Oz?

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:84%
These three sashes, or
cords, and their oddities

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:84%
catch our attention
as they remind us

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of the three rays of
the transfiguration.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.160 align:middle line:84%
As we noted, the Egyptian
three-rayed symbol

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:84%
morphed into all of these
three-rayed symbols, which

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
represent initiation
or instruction.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, the trip-dot
symbol of the Chintamani

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
appears on Jesus'
robe and on the book

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:12.220 align:middle line:84%
he is holding in the 6th
century icon from Mount Sinai.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:84%
More directly, the
Knights Templar

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
wore threefold cords,
or sashes, around waist

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that connected them to a
strange idol, a head, which

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
among other charges, lead
to their persecution.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:84%
This idol was said to have
assured their resurrection.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:84%
The idol was the
Shroud of Turin,

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
suggesting a direct connection
between the three chords

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.415 align:middle line:84%
and this three secrets
of resurrection.

00:32:46.415 --> 00:32:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Is there a three-pronged
sash, or a cord,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.855 align:middle line:84%
that connects us
to divine powers?

00:32:56.855 --> 00:33:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Is this umbilical
cord a musical chord?

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Speaking of threes, the three
Marys of the New Testament

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:10%
are similar to Job's three
daughters and the three

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:10%
golden boxes.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Could Job's daughters
and the Marys

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
be titles for women who knew
the secrets of ascension?

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.020 align:middle line:10%
It certainly appears possible.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Further, at the time of
Jesus, Mary Magdalene

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.590 align:middle line:10%
was the primary priestess
with this wisdom.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Some propose that
Mary is a title.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Does it signify a woman
who has attained knowledge

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%
of the secrets of resurrection?

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:middle line:10%
Is this why a Mary has
such a pivotal role

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.790 align:middle line:10%
in the resurrection of Jesus?

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Let us view the assumption
of Mary through this lens.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:10%
Again, we are connecting
the three daughters of Job

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:10%
with the three Marys present at
the crucifixion and entombment

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:10%
of Jesus.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:10%
These are assumed to be
Mary, mother of Jesus;

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:19.570 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene; and
Mary of Bethany.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:10%
The Eastern Orthodox
church teaches us

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:10%
that in addition to
Jesus, three other persons

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:10%
were taken bodily into Heaven.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:10%
They were Enoch, Elijah
or Elias, and Mary.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:10%
The Catholic Feast
of the Assumption

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.360 align:middle line:10%
is celebrated on
August the 15th,

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:10%
and the Eastern Orthodox
and Eastern Catholics

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:10%
celebrate the Theotokos, the
falling asleep of the mother

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.760 align:middle line:10%
of Jesus, on that same date.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:10%


00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:10%
Eastern Orthodox
Christians believe

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:10%
that Mary died a natural death,
that her soul was received

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.450 align:middle line:10%
by Christ upon death, and
that her body was resurrected

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.590 align:middle line:10%
on the third day
after her death,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:10%
and that she was taken
up into Heaven bodily

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:19.630 align:middle line:10%
in anticipation of the
general resurrection.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Dramatic icons reveal
this wondrous scene.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:10%
In this northern Greek
icon from the 16th century,

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.170 align:middle line:10%
Christ manifests in an
almond-shaped gateway,

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.666 align:middle line:10%
a mandola, filled
with holy blue light.

00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:10%
A seraphim hovers above
the gateway protectively.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The resurrected
Christ carries Mary

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.370 align:middle line:90%
through the portal, or gateway.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
In the death and
assumption of the Virgin,

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
from a church in Macedonia,
we see Jesus emerging

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
from a blue portal to
take the soul of Mary.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:09.870 align:middle line:10%
Mary ascends in an orb of light,
riding upon an arch of light.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.380 align:middle line:84%
An open gate to Heaven
is above or behind her.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:10%
As she ascends, she transmits
her Holy belt to Thomas.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:10%
According to the
passing of Mary,

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:10%
a text attributed to
Joseph of Aramathea,

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:10%
Thomas was the only witness
of the assumption of Mary

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.130 align:middle line:10%
into Heaven.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The other apostles were
miraculously transported

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.880 align:middle line:84%
to Jerusalem to
witness her death.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:10%
Thomas was left in India,
but after her first burial,

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.600 align:middle line:10%
he was transported
to her tomb where

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:10%
he witnessed her bodily
assumption into Heaven,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:10%
from which she
dropped her girdle.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Thomas is most famous,
apart from his mission

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.210 align:middle line:10%
to India, for the
doubting Thomas episode,

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:10%
John 20, verse 24
to 29, where he

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.830 align:middle line:10%
missed the post-resurrection
appearance of Jesus

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:17.640 align:middle line:10%
to the 10 other apostles,
and said he would not

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:24.980 align:middle line:10%
believe Jesus had returned
until he had felt his wounds.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:30.730 align:middle line:10%
In the story of the girdle
at the assumption of Mary,

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:10%
where the other
apostles were present,

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.360 align:middle line:10%
Thomas once again missed the
occasion, being on his way

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:10%
back from India.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:10%
So the Virgin Mary, aware
of Thomas' skeptical nature,

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.810 align:middle line:10%
appeared to him individually
and dropped, or transmitted,

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:56.480 align:middle line:10%
the girdle she was wearing down
onto him as she was ascending

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.590 align:middle line:10%
into Heaven, to give him
a physical proof of what

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:10%
he had seen.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:10%
Thomas' receipt of the
girdle is commonly depicted

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.680 align:middle line:10%
in medieval
Renaissance art, where

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:10%
it is featured as a long string.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:10%
According to tradition, the
sacred belt of the Virgin Mary

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:10%
is a piece of green woolen
fabric, approximately

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:10%
90 centimeters long, with
little strings at the ends

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.810 align:middle line:10%
to tie it up.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:10%
Did Thomas actually receive the
sash, or belt, of the Virgin

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:10%
to offer proof of his story
to the other apostles?

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:44.040 align:middle line:10%
Could such a relic
actually exist?

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:10%
Is this girdle, or cord,
one of the three cords

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:10%
of Job's daughters?

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:10%
Now here is an
extraordinary connection

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:10%
you won't hear anyone
else but on "Arcanum."

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Some shamanistic groups believe
that their sorcerers can

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:07.390 align:middle line:84%
ride rainbows and
ascend to the heavens.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:12.780 align:middle line:84%
They use red and blue ribbons
to symbolize rainbows.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the White Tara with
a red ribbon around her neck.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Looking close at
her knees, we see

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:25.050 align:middle line:84%
they are rainbow colored,
signifying the rainbow body.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Some scholars hold that
the red and yellow silk

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
ribbons that hang on the
frames of the tanka icons

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
are reflections of
this idea, the ribbon

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
standing for the rainbow on
which the sorcerers ride.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:10%
Tibetan history books hold
that the first generation

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.900 align:middle line:10%
of Tibetan kings
descended from the heavens

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:10%
to the sacred mountains.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:55.000 align:middle line:10%
In Religions of
Tibet, Giuseppe Tucci

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.640 align:middle line:10%
tells how they descended
upon these mountains

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.160 align:middle line:10%
from Heaven through
rope-like structures called

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.870 align:middle line:10%
the divine cord.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:10%
The heavenly rope is closely
connected to the rainbow,

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.470 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that these
cords are rainbow-like.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.380 align:middle line:10%
The summit of sacred
mountains were the places

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:10%
of contact between
Heaven and Earth.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
After their time
on Earth was up,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:84%
they returned back to
Heaven in a similar fashion.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The Rainbow Bridge
is assessed by beings

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:36.200 align:middle line:84%
who have achieved
their rainbow body.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the girdle, or belt,

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.130 align:middle line:84%
of the ascending
Marys symbolized

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
the attainment of the light
body, or rainbow body of light?

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:84%
If so, it explains why, like
the White Tara, Isis and Mary

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:90%
both wear the red sash.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It is the divine
cord, and a symbol

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.945 align:middle line:84%
of the secrets of
resurrection and ascension

00:41:02.945 --> 00:41:03.935 align:middle line:90%
that they possess.

00:41:03.935 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Arcanum."

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:23.900 align:middle line:90%
