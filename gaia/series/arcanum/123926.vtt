00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Here is a brief
overview of what is to come.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We will begin with the belief
that our divine sparks are also

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:90%
known as cosmic eggs.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Cultures the world over
and spanning millennia

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
taught that our individual eggs
are part of a greater whole.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:84%
How did all these ancient
civilizations learn this?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Were their cosmic
messengers that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:90%
brought them this knowledge?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.485 align:middle line:84%
We'll look in depth
at the blue sphere

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:90%
that the soul travels in.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
In tradition after
tradition, we learn

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that our soul is
capable of manifesting

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
a blue sphere that it can
travel the cosmos upon.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, where did
this idea come from,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and where possibly
can the soul go to?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the ultimate question
we're going to explore

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:90%
is, how are our souls created?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether you believe
in a God creator

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
or an ancient alien
intelligent design

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
or whatever tradition
you subscribe to,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
there are basically
three theories

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
about how our
souls were created.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
One says your parents
create your soul.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
A second says that
God created it.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And a third says,
you did it yourself,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and you will be responsible
for your own ascension as well.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you have more than one soul?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a very deep, but
necessary, conversation

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
for your soul exploration and
developing your soul plan.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Another important
question is, why does gold

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:90%
symbolize the soul?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it really true that
extraterrestrials came here

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.670 align:middle line:84%
long ago to mine gold, or is
it possible they were actually

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:90%
here for souls?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
The oldest human
stories involve gold,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
but is it really about soul?

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Were extraterrestrials
sent here in order

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to help our souls to ascend,
and is our physical human body

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
actually proof of
the existence of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:90%
these extraterrestrial beings?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Does everyone have a soul?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I recently had a conversation
with an ET insider

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
who told me that the
US government once

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
held an extraterrestrial
biological entity.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And this being told
them that the number

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
of souls in the
universe is finite,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
while the number of containers,
or vessels for souls,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:90%
was infinite.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Is this actually the case?

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I have been told by
shamans that souls line up

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
for the possibility of
a human incarnation.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:10%
Human embodiment, they say, is
one of the most precious things

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, so
we want to make sure

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:10%
that we're taking advantage
of this precious gift

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.590 align:middle line:10%
that we have been offered.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Earth is considered to be
a playground and a school

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
for the soul, and in
order to matriculate,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.419 align:middle line:84%
we must master the
matrix of matter.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take a look at what

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we know about matter from
the soul's perspective

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and how we can manipulate
that matter as well.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Numerous spiritual
traditions tell us

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
the soul chooses to manifest,
or grow a human body,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
in order to evolve.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
talk about karma in order

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to understand this
process of soul evolution

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
because our time
on Earth is finite.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies
are fragile, so we

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
need to make sure that we're
using this time as wisely

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
as possible, taking care
of our physical vessel

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
as best as we can.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at some tips
for doing that as well.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
We are challenged,
each of us, internally

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and externally, to do great
things with the precious time

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
we have in these bodies,
while also struggling

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
to survive and succeed,
all the while dealing

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
with our own limitations,
sufferings, fears,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and interpersonal conflicts,
before our time is up.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will also discuss the
quantum wave-particle duality

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
of the body and soul
and how learning

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to fluidly shift
between these two states

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:90%
is one of our ultimate goals.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
This is going to take us into
one of my favorite subjects,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:90%
the body as a stargate.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that this
divine spark within us

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:90%
manifest the body as a portal?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.065 align:middle line:84%
That is such an
incredible question,

00:04:49.065 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to present to
you some awesome evidence

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.620 align:middle line:90%
that that, in fact, is true.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll also look into the story
of the birth of Hatshepsut,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptian pharaoh.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In 1400 BC, her soul was
conducted into her body

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:90%
by the god, Amun.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
She was a starchild,
and as we'll see,

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
this story is repeated
1,400 years later

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:90%
in the birth of Jesus.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Can today's science
match this feat?

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually take a
soul from one container

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
and put it into another?

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The divine spark and the
butterfly symbolize the soul,

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
but so does the egg and
the bee and the serpent.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We'll begin to take a look at
the meaning of this symbolism

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so mind-blowing
to understand it.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.585 align:middle line:84%
We'll also look at
the hero's journey

00:05:40.585 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:90%
from the soul's perspective.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Discovered by Joseph Campbell
in the early 20th century,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
the hero's journey
is the path running

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
through the heart of all
great myths and stories

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Heroes and heroines
take the same journey.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.214 align:middle line:84%
Whether we were born
in 2000 BC or 2000 AD,

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
we are all on the soul's
path of ascension,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and essentially this
story is divided

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
into three parts-- separation,
initiation, and return,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
or ascension.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's all one journey, and we are
all the heroes of this journey.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there is
an identifiable path that

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:90%
leads to our soul's graduation?

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:10%
Knowing this path
provides the map,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and it also will tell you
where you're at in your soul's

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:10%
ascension plan.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at the Native
American traditions concerning

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
what they called
the path of souls.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible the way
Native American tradition

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
tells us how the soul's path
of initiation and ascension

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%
has been mapped for millennia.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
The journey into
the stars is well

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
known by the Native
Americans, and I

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
know you're going to find
this absolutely fascinating.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans left
us with clear instructions

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:90%
for navigating the afterlife.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see, we
have a lot to explore,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:90%
so let's get started.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.066 align:middle line:90%
