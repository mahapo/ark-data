>>WILLIAM HENRY: What if there
is a part of ourselves that

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.770 align:middle line:84%
has a bird's eye
view of our lives

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.529 align:middle line:90%
and can see into the future?

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.820 align:middle line:84%
What if you never connected
with that part of yourself,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.630 align:middle line:90%
then what if you did?

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250 align:middle line:84%
How different would your life
be if you followed its guidance?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Let's begin our
investigation into the divine

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
spark with some insight
into Gnosticism.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Gnosis means wisdom,
and Gnosticism is really

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
a collection of ancient ideas
about awakening or attaining

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:90%
enlightened consciousness.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of what we know about
Gnosticism comes from Egypt.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, the Nag Hammadi
library was unexpectedly

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Egypt, in
a cave in upper Egypt.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
This remarkable collection
of 4th century Coptic texts,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
or Egyptian Christian
texts, are thought

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to have been copied from
material that may date back

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to as early as the second
half of the 1st century.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And it casts new light upon
long obscured Christian history.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic views are
diverse; however, they

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
agreed on three things:
one, reincarnation,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the
soul will transmigrate

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
into new bodies from
lifetime to lifetime;

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
second, there exists a class
of evil powers called archons,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and part of our
quest is to learn

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to evade the archons, both
in life and in the afterlife;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
thirdly, they believed
in that resurrection

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.730 align:middle line:84%
was possible for
every individual.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that is
our ultimate goal.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We wish to resurrect
from this realm.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:10%
Gnostic theology centered
two additional ideas:

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:10%
that a divine spark
dwells within,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:10%
and that the process
of resurrection

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:10%
represents a universal
principle-- this means

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:10%
it happens not just on
earth, but in other realms--

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:10%
and that Jesus demonstrated
for humanity the way

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:10%
that people, ordinary people,
can ascend and resurrect

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:10%
into other realms, into
the divine realm, in fact.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:10%
And in William Blake's
magnificent painting

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:10%
of the resurrected
Jesus, we see his divine

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.180 align:middle line:10%
spark illuminated from within,
transforming his entire body

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:10%
into light.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:10%
"The Resurrection" from 1805
is one of Blake's masterpieces

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:10%
among many.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Another is his painting "Michael
Foretells the Crucifixion,"

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:10%
where Blake again emphasizes
that Jesus shows the way

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:10%
to light the candle
within, if you will,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:10%
ignite the divine spark, and
transform the body into light.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:10%
In other words, to resurrect the
body from the material plane.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:10%
Gnostics believe that in
order to achieve salvation,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:10%
or resurrection,
one must possess

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:10%
a certain knowledge,
or gnosis, which

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:10%
must be delivered to a person
by a messenger of light.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:10%
Now this gives us all
hope, because we don't all

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:10%
have to know exactly
everything about resurrection.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
know enough to come

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:84%
on the radar of a messenger
of light, who will assist us

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:90%
in our transformation.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:10%
This literature is
called apocalyptic.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And what that means is
it's revelatory literature

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:10%
in which revelation,
or gnosis, is delivered

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:10%
to a human recipient by an
otherworldly or supernatural

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:10%
being.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:10%
This revelation discloses
a transcendent reality,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:10%
or a supernatural world.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking
about the Gnostics

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:10%
recognizing that there
are these messenger

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:10%
beings, celestial beings,
otherworldly supernatural

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:10%
beings, who can enter
into our consciousness

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:10%
and assist us in completing our
earthly mission of attaining

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:10%
the resurrection body.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:10%
An example of this
literature is the "Apocalypse

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:10%
of Abraham," which describes
a celestial being named Jaeol,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:10%
who some believe is actually
Yahweh, the Old Testament

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:10%
God, an angel who lived
in the seventh heaven

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:10%
and was sent to
Abraham to reveal

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:10%
the history of his people
and was also sent to Daniel,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:10%
who lived in Babylon during
the Old Testament times.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:10%
So here is this
remarkable angel Jaeol,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:10%
who is shown with this
rainbow ring round his body.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:10%
This is based upon the
description in the "Apocalypse

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:10%
of Abraham" that tells us that
the appearance of this being's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:10%
body was like sapphire,
the look of his countenance

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:10%
like chrysolite, and the
hair of his head like snow,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:10%
with a turban upon his head like
the appearance of a rainbow.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:10%
This is yet another example
of a rainbow-like being,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:10%
where a celestial being
possessing a rainbow body that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:10%
manifests on the Earth plane
and delivers cosmic knowledge.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So here's the detail of Jaeol
with this shimmering or shining

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:84%
face, this rainbow
ring around its head,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
indicating that this is a
being of rainbow body light.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
This being is delivering
sacred knowledge

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to Abraham, who is
consuming that knowledge.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
He's eating this book.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
John the Revelator
also did the same thing

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
when an angel
manifested before him.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
John ate the heavenly
book that contained

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostic knowledge
of ascension.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
This messenger is a helper
that descends from above

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and is considered actually
our heavenly light twin.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
What they're suggesting is
that our earthly body is,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, a sort of a puppet
on a string of this more

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
magnificent, evolved aspect
of ourselves, our higher self.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And by linking with it,
we're able to download

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:84%
this sacred knowledge that we
need to complete our ascension.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Every soul has a
messenger of light.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Every soul has a higher self.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of our
quest is to learn

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
to link with that
aspect of ourselves.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's what
brought you here today

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
to watch this program, to absorb
this knowledge at this time.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:84%
By being here, it says
you're ready to make

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
the link with this
aspect of yourself.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
You're ready to get
the message, to receive

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:90%
the download in other words.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
"If you want to know your Higher
Self," said Rudolf Steiner,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:84%
"look at the people you've
met in the last year."

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Who are you calling
into your life that

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:84%
will help you to
complete your ascension?

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Powerful, powerful
idea from Mr. Steiner.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.915 align:middle line:84%
I was once in Florida giving a
presentation on this subject,

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.077 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the audience,
hey, have you ever

00:07:07.077 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:90%
connected with your higher self?

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And how do you know
when it's your higher

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:90%
self that's speaking to you?

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Your messenger self?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And a woman-- I'll never forget
her answer-- she said, whenever

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a time of crisis
or perhaps afraid,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.130 align:middle line:84%
the voice always
asks, what would

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:90%
you do if you weren't afraid?

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember the message of the
transfiguration from Jesus.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:90%
Rise and do not be afraid.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It seems that that's our number
one mission on the Gnostic path

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is to overcome fear,
to leave that behind,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and act is if, not that we're
fearless, but rather, that we

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
are fully empowered beings.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you weren't afraid?

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if you
knew you would always

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:90%
have the highest success?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
What new decisions or
choices would you make?

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
What things would you
do that perhaps you've

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.949 align:middle line:90%
procrastinated on?

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe part of the message
of this program for you

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
now is to-- to get on to
those things, to do it now,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and to act as if you
are fully empowered.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And then you will be.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Could be as simple as that.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
"What you're looking for,"
said St. Francis of Assisi,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%
"is what is looking."

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
that messenger self

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is ever present in
our consciousness.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
seeking its guidance,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
it's also what is
looking at us and trying

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with us.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So what you are looking
for is what is looking,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%
another profound message.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:84%
This story is reflected
in a Slavonic tale

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:90%
called "The Ladder of Jacob."

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a variation on the book
of Genesis' story of Jacob, who

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
fell asleep and laid his head
on the Philosopher's Stone

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and saw the ladder ascending
into the heavens with angels

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
ascending and descending
on either side.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:84%
In the Slavonic version,
Jacob sees an angel

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
named Sariel, who
instructs Jacob regarding

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:90%
the sacred secrets of heaven.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
He's communicating with his
messenger self, in other words.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in the
stories, at the conclusion

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of this instruction, Jacob
is given the knowledge

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that he has a heavenly
identity, just like we all do,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that his celestial
self, his star self,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
is truly a great, luminous
being, probably a rainbow

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
body being, who serves
before the face of God.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And this aspect of ourselves,
our Earthly self, again,

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.080 align:middle line:84%
is just a-- sort of like
the puppet on the string

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that's here to
explore earth life,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to work out karma,
to learn certain things,

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or, in the deepest
Gnostic sense,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
to serve as an
agent of God's love.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.810 align:middle line:10%
That's why we're here is to
learn to love to the greatest

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:10%
extent that we possibly can.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:10%
To receive the knowledge
from the higher self

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:10%
requires, obviously, that we
let go of fear and embrace love,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:10%
but also that we must
be trying to be reaching

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.220 align:middle line:10%
beyond the evil, dark,
material, physical earth body

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:10%
and towards that of the
good, light, immaterial,

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual worlds.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:10%
So much of our time is
spent serving the material

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:10%
world rather than
the immaterial.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I often ask people
when they're working

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual realms,
what is your exit strategy?

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean
where are you going

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to go when you leave
the earth plane?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And how are you
going to get there?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
What's your exit strategy?

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we often
spend so much more

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
of our time focusing
on our 401(k)

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.130 align:middle line:84%
than we focus on where we're
going from here in eternity.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Earth life is a
blink of eye, as they say,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and our eternal self
will be spending time

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:90%
in eternity in the cosmos.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But yet on Earth, we
don't think too much

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
about that aspect of our
lives and that realm.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But the Gnostics
are encouraging us

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to do so because, in doing so,
we broaden our perspective,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
open up our spectrum.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We're focused on
that one channel,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
listening to that same song over
and over again, when there's

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
a whole other range or spectrum
of frequency and vibration,

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
tones and tunes out here
that we can tap into just

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
by opening up our hearts and
minds to the immaterial realm.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
The following Gnostic
story is offered

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
as a bit of a meditation, and
it would be OK at this point

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
if you just took a deep
breath, closed your eyes,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.795 align:middle line:84%
and for the next moment or so,
think deeply about the words

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:90%
that I'm saying here.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.086 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
going to offer to

00:11:39.086 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
you is what's called
the Gnostic call.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this is when
the Gnostics would invite

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
new initiates into their
schools, their mystery schools,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.970 align:middle line:84%
this is the story
they would tell them.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it serves as
sort of a guideline

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
or an outline of
our earthly mission.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:90%
So here it goes.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a Gnostic
story that's based

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
on the Gnostic
Hymn of the Pearl.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's also found in the
Nag Hammadi library in Egypt

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and, as I said, is referred
to as the Gnostic call.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:90%
So here it goes.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you are a
prince or a princess.

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.880 align:middle line:84%
One day, your parents,
the king and queen,

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
send you on a mission
to Egypt, which

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes Earth
life in this case.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
You must find a pearl
guarded by a hungry dragon.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
You take off your royal robe,
your light garment that's

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
shimmering with jewels,
and you leave the kingdom

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
of your parents, which
is in a celestial realm.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You journey into Egypt,
putting on dirty clothing

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and disguising yourself
as an Egyptian.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the
Egyptians discover

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:90%
that you're a foreigner.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
They give you food that makes
you forget your royal birth.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
You forget that you're a star
child temporarily inhabiting

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%
this realm.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And this food makes you believe
that you're one of them.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And you sink into a
deep, forgetful sleep.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Your parents see
your plight, and they

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
send you a letter that
tells you to awaken.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the letter
is written in your heart,

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Hymn of the Pearl.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
It reminds you of your quest
to recover the pearl, which

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
is the Philosopher's Stone,
the Chintamani stone.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
you remember who

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.760 align:middle line:84%
you are, a child of
kings, a royal child

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
from the celestial realms.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And you quickly, then,
subdue the dragon

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and recover the
pearl and depart,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.610 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind your dirty
clothing, your Earthly

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:90%
clothing.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:10%
And what happens
next is you then

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:10%
return to your native
land, the celestial realms,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:10%
and you see your shimmering,
royal robe, your light body

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:10%
garment, which reminds
you of the splendor

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:10%
you lived in before,
your original home.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:10%
The garment speaks
to you, telling you

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:10%
that it belongs
to the one who is

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:10%
stronger than all human beings.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:10%
And now you put on your
royal robe once more,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:10%
and you return to
your father's palace.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
The king and queen, of
course, symbolize the creator

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and a feminine
being the Gnostics

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:84%
called the holy mother,
or Sophia, or wisdom.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Their kingdom is a realm of
light, a place totally outside

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
of matter as we know it.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It's spoken of as the
pleroma, or fullness.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Some believe it's the center
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Your royal robe,
the shimmering robe,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.920 align:middle line:84%
that represents your true self,
your divine lineage and image.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:84%
The dirty clothing represents
your Earthly body, your Earthly

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
matter body, which
you donned when

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.980 align:middle line:84%
you entered Egypt,
the material world.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So this expresses
for us this idea

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're originally celestial
light beings who temporarily

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
inhabit one of these
earthly vehicles.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And our ultimate mission
is to recall who we truly

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
are as celestial beings and
reclaim that garment of light.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
When you descended into the
Earth plane into mortality,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
you left behind
your divine image.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:84%
You forgot who you
truly were, and you

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.310 align:middle line:90%
became an incomplete person.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:10%
You fell asleep when you
forgot your true origin.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:10%
And the message sent by your
parents represents the savior.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:10%
He will awaken you,
this messenger,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:10%
and will remind
you what you must

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:10%
do: recover the pearl, that
divine spark within your soul,

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.420 align:middle line:10%
find your way back to
the realm of the light,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:10%
and clothe yourself once more
in your royal light garment.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, reintegrate
with your divine image.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the message of the
Gnostics, the Gnostic call.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:10%
And by recovering your soul and
reintegrating with the divine,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:10%
remembering yourself as in
the Egyptian story of Osiris,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:10%
you will have achieved
gnosis, or knowledge, awakened

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:10%
conscience-- consciousness,
enlightenment,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.575 align:middle line:10%
which is salvation
in the gnostic sense.

00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:10%
It's something you
must do for yourself,

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:10%
and only you can
do for yourself.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:10%
For the Gnostics,
achieving gnosis

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:10%
meant to know oneself as God.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Know thyself is
the key inscription

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:90%
over the temple of Delphi.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the primary
Gnostic inscription.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:10%
Know thyself as a divine being.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:10%
But to know meant not merely to
understand one's divine origin,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:10%
but to achieve the classic goal
of the mystic union with God.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:10%
That is our ultimate goal.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And putting on the royal
garment and recovering the pearl

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
are just some of
the images Gnostics

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
used to describe
achieving gnosis.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:10%
According to one gnostic
myth, the shaping

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:10%
of the material
world was the result

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:10%
of Sophia, who is
often described

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:10%
as an emanation
of eternal light,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:10%
light beyond light, coming
from beyond the material world,

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.040 align:middle line:10%
an immaculate mirror
of God's activity,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:10%
and as the spouse of the
Lord, say the Gnostic texts.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
She's visualized as a goddess.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:10%
Here's an icon of
Sophia from Russia

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:10%
in the late 16th
century, where we

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:10%
see Sophia enthroned
with Mary and John

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.760 align:middle line:10%
the Baptist and the baby
Jesus on either side.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:10%
We see the familiar imagery
of the portal, or the gateway.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:10%
It could actually be an image
of the divine pearl as well.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:10%
In another example, we see
Sophia enthroned once again,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:10%
and it illustrates the
concept of personifying Wisdom

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:10%
as a deity, as a
feminine deity, that

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:10%
was familiar to the Romans.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:10%
They got this from the Greeks
and the Greek philosophy

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:10%
and the mystery religions of
the Near East of Egypt, of Iran

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:10%
and Iraq, where these
concepts were proliferated

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:10%
and were ultimately synthesized
by the Jewish mystics,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:10%
known as the Essenes, who
lived in Alexandria, Egypt,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:10%
in Jerusalem, and ultimately
moved to Qumran in the Holy

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:10%
Land.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:10%
For Christian theologians,
its legitimacy

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:10%
was endorsed in
the opening verses

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:10%
of the ninth chapter of
the book of Proverbs.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:10%
"Wisdom hath built
her house," they said.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And of course,
Wisdom's house can

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:10%
be interpreted on many levels.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
At one level, Wisdom's
house is our body,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:90%
and Sophia dwells within us.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Her throne is our body.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Your body is actually the
throne of this divine light

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and this divine energy.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we see
Sophia, once again,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
clothed in red, winged,
with Mary holding the baby

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and John the
Baptist on either side.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Mary and Jesus are
shown in these images

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.320 align:middle line:84%
because they were
the two-- or, excuse

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
me, Mary and John the Baptist
are shown because they were

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the two most important people
in the mission of Jesus,

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the messenger sent here to
awaken us and to enlighten us.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:10%
Here's a beautiful painting
by Sano di Piedro showing

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:10%
Wisdom emanating from God.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And we look at this image
here, and we readily

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:10%
think, OK, I see the stars.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:10%
We see God in another realm.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And Wisdom being pushed
into the material realm

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:10%
as if through a
portal, a gateway,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:10%
a wormhole-- very
interesting idea.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Because what links
dimensions but a wormhole?

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:10%
Here we see, again,
Wisdom clothed

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:10%
in royal garments with
the crown and scepter

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:10%
as she sits on a throne
as the personification

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Wisdom of God.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:10%
This is a particular favorite,
because we see, again, Wisdom

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:10%
is winged, radiant,
wearing the red robe.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:10%
And I emphasize the
red robe because we're

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:10%
going to see that come
back up, that imagery come

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
back up in a really powerful
place here in a moment.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:10%
Continuing, now we see
another example here

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:10%
with Wisdom with
Jesus just behind,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:10%
indicating that he is also
from this otherworldly,

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:10%
celestial realm, or
other dimensional realm.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Another example, also
from Russia, same imagery.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:10%
So we see it over
and over again.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:10%
But I particularly like this
one because we see, of course,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Wisdom with the red
robe, winged, Mary,

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:10%
John the Baptist on either side.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:10%
But look at the
detail above Jesus.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:10%
Now this is always
fascinating to me

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:10%
in Christian art when
I see above Sophia,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:10%
or any other figure, angels
holding this banner of stars.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:10%
The reason that's
so intriguing to me

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:10%
is because what it symbolizes
is an other dimensional realm.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:10%
This is with these artists are
expressing the idea of a realm

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:10%
beyond the stars, a light
beyond light, something that

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:10%
is almost unfathomable
to the human imagination,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:10%
and is shown very simply
and elegantly here

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.020 align:middle line:10%
as this banner of stars that
is unrolled by the angels.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Because of course,
these angelic beings

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
possess the power
of the universe.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
They can roll up a
dimension into a roll

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and unroll it and step through
that gateway and travel

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:90%
interdimensionally.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this is
something that all of us

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
are said to have the capability
of doing or attaining

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:90%
these capabilities.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So think about that.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:10%
So, side by side
example here of a couple

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.332 align:middle line:10%
of these images of
Wisdom enthroned

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:10%
and in the one on the
right in particular

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:10%
with the banner of stars
above, representing

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.322 align:middle line:10%
the other dimensions.

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:10%
One of our favorite
paintings, of course,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:10%
is Constantino Brumidi,
who painted Wisdom holding

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:10%
her staff of arcanum in
the United States capital,

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:10%
the US Capitol temple.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So of course Wisdom
is going to be there.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:90%
She's present.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
She's guiding the
founding fathers

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and is an inspiration to
the founding fathers, who

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
must have understood
this idea of the divine

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
spark when they expressed
their idea of creating

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
a psychological space, America,
where souls could attain

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
ultimate wisdom and their
ultimate capability.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:10%
Through her desire
to know the Father,

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:10%
Wisdom, Sophia, was
cast out of the Pleroma,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:10%
the Gnostic heaven,
again possibly

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:10%
the center of the galaxy, at
least in some people's views.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:10%
And I like that, because it
localizes in our imagination

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:10%
the location of God's throne.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And her desire gave birth to
God, who created the material

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
world, again showing this
overlap between the immaterial

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and the material world.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Although she was eventually
restored to the Pleroma,

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
bits of her divinity remain
in the material world.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:90%
These are the divine sparks.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:10%
So here we see Sophia from
a 16th century painting

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:10%
from the "Book of
Wonders," shown

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:10%
as a feminine angel
holding the trumpet.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Now look at that trumpet
and the detail here.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And just see if you can pull
out the wormhole symbolism,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.570 align:middle line:90%
as I can.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
We have this bell-shaped
opening here.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We have this tube and the
opening coming out here.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, maybe not, is what
the artist had in mind here.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But from a modern
perspective, we

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
can look at that image and
say, that's a wormhole.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And again, "Wisdom
has built their house.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.790 align:middle line:84%
She has set up her seven
pillars," the famed seven

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:90%
pillars of wisdom.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:10%
And when we're looking at
various interpretations

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:10%
of that statement,
as in this example

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:10%
here from Kiev of "Saint
Sophia The Wisdom of God,"

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:10%
we see Sophia standing
amongst the seven pillars.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:10%
And of course, as
we look at this,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:10%
we see the seven pillars
are externalized.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:10%
We have Sophia, the baby
Christ in her heart chakra,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:10%
radiant, exploding into light,
a radiating light with the seven

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:10%
pillars all around her.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And now, once again, when we
look at an image such as this

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:10%
and we see Sophia with her open
heart chakra and her hands out,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:10%
it's a good thing to do to
mirror that image, to reflect

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:10%
what you're seeing as well as
contemplating and meditating

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:10%
on this image.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you put up your
hands to your screen,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you can reflect
the energy that's

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
emanating from Sophia
at this moment.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That is the intention
behind images

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:10%
such as this, is that we're to
use them as mirrors in order

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:10%
to bring this divine light
and wisdom into our own life.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:10%
And in a sense, then,
Sophia becomes the messenger

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:10%
who has stepped through
the portal of your screen

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:10%
and is now here to illuminate
and awaken your consciousness.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:10%
So take a moment here to
absorb this light and vibration

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:10%
of wisdom coming from Sophia.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.580 align:middle line:10%


00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:10%
And as you're doing
so, once again

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:10%
note that she is robed
in her red cloak.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Here's God above,
sending or beaming

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:84%
this ray of divine light
and love into Sophia

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:90%
from another worldly realm.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
We see the radiant dove
of the Holy Spirit,

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing the
cosmic vibration.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the whole
scene comes together.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:10%
We count the steps here.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:10%
We go one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, again,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:10%
all good children go to heaven.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And it looks as if Sophia is in
some otherworldly temple here.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And we feel as if we
can ascend the steps

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and just enter into this divine
realm and stand beside her.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But another perspective here
is that those seven pillars

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
are actually within us.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.330 align:middle line:90%
They represent our chakras.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
The ladder, or stairway,
to heaven within us,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:90%
the seven pillars of wisdom.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And by activating the chakras,
we illuminate our consciousness

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.995 align:middle line:84%
and become fully
functioning beings.

00:26:05.995 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:10%
Another example, an icon
of Sophia, the holy Wisdom,

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:10%
surrounded by the seven pillars.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:10%
It was particularly
in Russia coming out

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:10%
of the Eastern
tradition where we

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:23.140 align:middle line:10%
see images such as this that
are extraordinarily empowering.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're always stepping up
our vibration or our frequency.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We see the Hebrew
high priest here,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
the Israelite high
priest, wearing the breast

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
plate of righteousness,
triggering us

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
that this is a path
of righteousness.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And righteous simply
means to follow

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
the good path, or
the godly path.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
We all know those
self-righteous types.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not our goal.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But our goal certainly is
to become righteous beings,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to be on the path of doing the
right thing with right life,

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.530 align:middle line:84%
right thought, right
action, right intention.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the
Buddhist Eightfold

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Path of righteousness
that we're describing here

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and suggests an overlap
between these Gnostic,

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
or enlightened, traditions.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Our behavior, our actions,
are the key in Earth life.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you behave
when no one is looking

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:90%
is not a rhetorical question.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Because someone
always is looking.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Your divine self,
your higher self,

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
is always watching
and saying, William, I

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
know you could have done a
lot better in that situation.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And most often we
don't get to redo.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's always best to have
our highest intention in mind

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and make sure our actions
are on the right path.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, unfortunately,
in the Earth plane--

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
this isn't a judgment
or an incrimination.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But most of us
remain unconscious

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of the original spark
within us and certainly

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:90%
the messenger within us.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We tend to externalize,
and we feel

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:84%
like there's a savior being
or some other figure that's

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:84%
going to come into our life
and make everything OK.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And we don't take that
responsibility for ourselves

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
when the Gnostics were clearly
telling us, hey, it's up to us.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to take
that first right step

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and stay on that right path.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
become conscious of this aspect

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves during an
awakening experience.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that's a
moment of synchronicity.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We've probably all had
that experience, where

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
we're driving down the
road and all of a sudden,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.380 align:middle line:90%
a voice says, oh, no.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
You're about to turn right,
but you've got to turn left.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.731 align:middle line:90%
And we follow that guidance.

00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we look to
the right, and there's

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:90%
a cataclysmic event that occurs.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we wonder, gosh, where
did that voice come from?

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's our
higher self that's

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.620 align:middle line:84%
always sitting right
beside us all along.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:90%
It has that bird's eye view.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
It can see on down the road.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:90%
It can see the future.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And if we listen to that
voice and consistently listen

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
to that voice, we're going
to avoid many obstacles.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, it's
where it's leading us

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:84%
is to that place of the light
and illumination and awakening.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's its ultimate intention.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.040 align:middle line:10%
And that's where we
want to go is that place

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:10%
of light and illumination.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:10%
Every person has within
them a higher ego,

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:10%
or portion of the cosmic soul.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:10%
The Sufis and the Kabbalists
called it the divine spark.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And they believe it's
contained or imprisoned

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:10%
within the human body.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.500 align:middle line:10%
My good friend, an artist
Mr. Dana Augustine,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:10%
visualized the divine
spark for us in this way,

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:10%
showing a humanoid
shape, a human female,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:10%
in an almond-shaped gateway,
a mandorla, surrounded

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:10%
by rainbow-colored
light, or fire,

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:10%
with this golden
kernel surrounding it.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:10%
We can see this based
on Gnostic texts.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is how they
described the divine spark

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.180 align:middle line:90%
as that golden kernel.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Gnostics
teach that who we are

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:10%
and what it is that is
enlightened within us--

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.710 align:middle line:10%
or perfected is the term
they also prefer to use,

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:10%
in the alchemical tradition,
that is-- is a solar drop,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.660 align:middle line:10%
an immortal pearl, an
indestructible drop, a seed

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.200 align:middle line:10%
atom that is perceived by
some as a drop of molten gold

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:10%
or stardust.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:10%
Remember that Joni Mitchell
song, "you are stardust,

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:10%
you are golden?"

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.260 align:middle line:84%
That's an absolute,
literal Gnostic truth

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that she's offering, a true gem
she's offering in that song.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It is the inner light within us.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps you want
to take a moment

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:84%
to meditate on
this image as well.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And take it into your being
and reflect on, wait a minute,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
this body is not who I truly am.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
This divine spark, this immortal
pearl, this spec of stardust

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:90%
is who I truly am.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is what will
carry me from incarnation

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to incarnation on my
path of reincarnation.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Various names for this
transcendent aspect of our self

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:03.980 align:middle line:90%
are offered.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
That's called Our
Original Luminous Nature

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.300 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese Manichaeanism, the
Living Self, the Luminous Self.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Mana.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's also referred to
as the Spirit in Us,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
the Inner Man, the
Spark, the Divine Spark,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the Seed of Light, all
perfectly appropriate terms

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:84%
for describing this
true essence within us.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.100 align:middle line:84%
The Bible alludes to the idea
of a divine spark within us.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 1:26 teaches
that every human being

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:90%
possesses the image of God.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Ecclesiastes declares
that God has set eternity

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.260 align:middle line:90%
in the hearts of men.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:84%
That might even suggest
a location of the divine

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:90%
spark within us.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Do we have that aspect of
ourselves in our hearts,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:84%
or is it located in
another part of our body?

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.240 align:middle line:84%
In Luke, Jesus proclaims the
kingdom of God is within you.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's spread out all around
us, and we just don't see it.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.460 align:middle line:84%
We're blinded by
the material light.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We think this is
all there is, and we

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
stay focused on this very
narrow frequency spectrum,

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.015 align:middle line:84%
very seldom wandering
out beyond it.

00:32:13.015 --> 00:32:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the
divine self lives

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
is on the periphery,
on the perimeter,

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.170 align:middle line:90%
beyond the narrow way.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
called upon to do

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is to expand our consciousness,
to expand our imagination,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to encompass the
immaterial realm

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and realize that all, everything
that we see that's material

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
actually originates in
the immaterial realm.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
The Bible teaches that
every human being possesses

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.500 align:middle line:84%
an immaterial soul
spirit, a divine spark.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it is this part
of us that connects

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:84%
with God-- very
powerful teaching.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It's no exaggeration
to say, actually,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
that the discovery of this
transcendent, inner aspect

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
of our self, or this
principle within us,

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and the supreme concern
about its destiny

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.220 align:middle line:84%
is the very center
of gnostic belief.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the aim
of all of our lives

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:90%
is to make that connection.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Remember the Hymn of the Pearl.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:90%
It says, remember who you are.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Remember that immortal
pearl within you.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Snatch it away from the
dragon that guards it.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon, of course,
is the material Earth life

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:90%
that seeks to consume us.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:84%
The divine spark,
the Gnostics teach,

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is what grows the
vehicles for incarnation,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.127 align:middle line:84%
in particular the human
body, but the Gnostics,

00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
like the ancient Egyptians, seem
to believe that we could even

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:84%
incarnate as cats and
other animals-- whatever

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
suits the needs of the soul,
whatever it needs to learn.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But let's just focus
on the human body now

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and this teaching
that the divine spark

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is what grows our physical body
as a vehicle for incarnation.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:84%
All the individual souls,
or divine particles

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:84%
of primordial light, constitute
the great universal soul.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:90%
We all have one.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is what has created
our physical body, which

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:84%
means our physical
body is always

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:90%
connected to all that is.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:14.280 align:middle line:84%
We just have to take the
blinders off, take off

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:84%
the lens of Earth life and
awaken to the greater cosmos.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.412 align:middle line:84%
Where is that divine
spark located in the body?

00:34:22.412 --> 00:34:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some
traditions, they want

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to put it down here in the
sacral area of the body.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They put it in the
lower pelvis region.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:35.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is a
Jewish Gnostic tradition,

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:84%
where they tell us that
the divine spark is located

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.030 align:middle line:84%
in the sacrum bone,
which they refer

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to as the sacred or holy
bone, the resurrection bone.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Also they call it
luz, or almond.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.151 align:middle line:84%
And they refer to it as a
doorway to the other world.

00:34:52.151 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us that
it is this bone that

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:90%
ultimately resurrects the body.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Other traditions tell
us, no, the divine spark

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually located
in the heart chakra.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes sense.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:10%
But the truth of
the matter is here

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.460 align:middle line:10%
is that-- or, the
fact of the matter

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:10%
is that our body is manifested
by this divine aspect

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves according
to the Gnostics.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.980 align:middle line:10%
Bones, fascia,
connective tissue,

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:10%
and even some of the
supportive tissues in the brain

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.630 align:middle line:10%
are composed of a liquid
crystalline substance.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:10%
It's like a crystal on a radio
set that's used by the divine

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:10%
spark to tune in to
these spiritual or divine

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.966 align:middle line:10%
frequencies.

00:35:28.966 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:10%
The interesting thing about the
crystals and crystal structures

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:10%
is that they actually allow
for quantum phenomena.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately it is through
this crystalline aspect

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves that
we're able to tune

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.880 align:middle line:10%
in to these divine
vibrations and reconnect

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:10%
with our true, divine
self in the Pleroma.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So bottom line is, in
effect, our bodies and brains

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:57.910 align:middle line:84%
are a device, a tool,
an instrument created

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
by our divine spark out of DNA
to act as information gathering

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:84%
equipment, as well as Earthly
transportation vehicles and as

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
energy harvesting and
processing devices.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:84%
E.J. Gold has a beautiful book
called "The Human Biological

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Transformational Apparatus."

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like kind
of a cold, left brain way

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to think of the body, but
it drives the point home.

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:84%
This body is meant to be used
as a vehicle for incarnation,

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that our divine spark grows to
fulfill its spiritual mission

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and destiny.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
charged with doing

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is taking our emphasis
off the physical

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and putting it on the
immaterial, divine aspect

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.486 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:36:42.486 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are,
once again, looking

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.190 align:middle line:84%
at these images of
the divine spark.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
This spark, as I
said, is thought

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
of as a kernel of immortality.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of an egg
or embryo and may

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:10%
be compared with the
chrysalis from which

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.630 align:middle line:10%
the butterfly emerges.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:10%
And as I've said in
other presentations,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.580 align:middle line:10%
the ultimate example
of the butterfly human

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:10%
is, of course, the
resurrection of Christ.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:10%
And in Pinturicchio's beautiful
"Resurrection" image here,

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:10%
we see Jesus manifesting
the light body,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.480 align:middle line:10%
looking very much like a
kind of a popcorn kernel that

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:10%
has exploded into
a piece of popcorn,

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:10%
or the divine spark that is
manifesting a radiating light.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It expresses the idea that
the human body is just

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:90%
an aspect of our true selves.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It is meant to be utilized for
a specific purpose, acquisition

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual knowledge and
understanding during life

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.037 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately to transform
it, to resurrect it

00:37:44.037 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
into its most magnificent
light body aspect.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:10%
So here we see Jesus
manifesting the light body

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.070 align:middle line:10%
from within the
physical human body.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:10%
Pinturicchio also shows
this resurrection image,

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:10%
where now, instead
of Jesus, it's

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.970 align:middle line:10%
actually Mary who is
in the divine spark,

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:10%
the almond-shaped
shaped gateway.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And she is modeling this
process of resurrection for us.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:84%
She's going from human to divine
and radiating the divine light,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:84%
or allowing her divine
spark to fully manifest

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:90%
as a light being.

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.969 align:middle line:10%
Another powerful example-- The
"Assumption of the Virgin."

00:38:26.969 --> 00:38:29.260 align:middle line:10%
Most people don't-- when they
think about resurrection,

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.680 align:middle line:10%
they're thinking about Jesus.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:10%
But little do they realized
that Mother Mary, as well

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:10%
as the Magdalene, also went
through the resurrection

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And here from Bernardo
Daddi's beautiful painting

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.210 align:middle line:10%
in the Metropolitan
Museum, we see

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:10%
Mary in the almond-shaped
gateway, symbolic of the divine

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:10%
spark.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.570 align:middle line:10%
She's holding the
book, and she's

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:54.560 align:middle line:10%
radiating the light of the light
body, or the resurrection body.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.330 align:middle line:84%
As usual, the crown on her head
is radiant and illuminated.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:02.530 align:middle line:84%
She wears the jewel
on her crown chakra,

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.810 align:middle line:84%
indicating that she has
fully activated her chakras.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Same thing here, where
Mary is in the light body.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Her cloak is covered
with stars, indicating

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that she is in her star
body, or her radiant body.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And she is showing us,
or modeling for us,

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:22.030 align:middle line:84%
this process of awakening,
this process of allowing

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.340 align:middle line:84%
the divine spark to
be fully illuminated.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
She has become a fully
functioning human being.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:10%
The seed, of course, was the
earliest Christian metaphor

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:10%
for the resurrection
of the body.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:10%
As a seed is transformed
into a body, so,

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:40.460 align:middle line:10%
too, do our Earthly bodies--
or will our Earthly bodies

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:10%
be transformed into our
Heavenly light bodies.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:10%
Now this is a very
powerful concept

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:10%
here because it tells us that
the blueprint for this glory

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:10%
body, light body, rainbow
body, body of light

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.370 align:middle line:10%
is within our DNA.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to go seek it.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It's hard-wired into us.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It's coded into us.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's awaiting the moment
when a mysterious force, called

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:10%
"the last trump" in the book
of Revelation, a tone, wave

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:10%
of reverberation, is what
the Greek word trump means.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And then it is
awakened from its sleep

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:10%
and it begins reaching
towards heaven.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.710 align:middle line:10%
Again, affirming this
idea that everything

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:10%
is already built in within us.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
challenged with doing

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:84%
is connecting with that
divine aspect of ourselves.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.060 align:middle line:10%
Just as an oak tree
does not look at all

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:10%
like an acorn from
which it sprung,

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:10%
but has physical continuity
with the acorn-- it other words,

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.040 align:middle line:10%
it's the same DNA-- so, too,
does our light body grow

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:10%
from our divine spark,
or our seed atom.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that too often
we identify with the acorn

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and don't feed our imagination
with images of the oak tree.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
That's how I view, in part,
my mission and Clare's mission

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:84%
in "Arcanum" is we hope
to feed your light body,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.170 align:middle line:84%
your imagination, with
images of the light body.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So now you can begin connecting
with that aspect of yourself.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to grow
into that aspect of yourself.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And as you start growing into
it, you, like the oak tree,

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:10%
will become an unstoppable
force, a force of inspiration

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:10%
that will continue
to reverberate long

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.690 align:middle line:10%
into the future.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:middle line:10%
Paul tells us that we will
be changed, metamorphosed,

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.630 align:middle line:10%
or transfigured by an
incomparably great power,

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:10%
the same one that
resurrected Jesus.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:10%
The body will be imperishable,
immortal, glorious, powerful

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.590 align:middle line:10%
Paul compares this change
to the sprouting of a seed.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, Paul must
have taken a lesson

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.380 align:middle line:84%
from the Gnostics up at
Qumran or the Essenes

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
up at Qumran who were
familiar with this imagery.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps he learned it in
Egypt, where they also

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.320 align:middle line:84%
were familiar with this idea
that we are a seed atom,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.090 align:middle line:84%
a divine spark within that
can grow into this radiant

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.940 align:middle line:84%
aspect, fed with
the proper light

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.780 align:middle line:84%
or vibration, this great
power, as it's described.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:10%
In Nashville, Tennessee,
where Clare and I live,

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:10%
we go to a beautiful church.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:17.480 align:middle line:10%
And in a small chapel, they
have this magnificent image

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Resurrection of Jesus.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:10%
He's exploding into
this radiant light.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.200 align:middle line:10%
He's the divine
spark that's fanned

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.650 align:middle line:10%
into a flame and the flame into
a sun and the sun into a star,

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.980 align:middle line:10%
to paraphrase Harold
Bailey once again.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.440 align:middle line:10%
But what intrigues
me about this is

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:10%
that when we come
into the detail,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:10%
we see that Jesus is wearing
his red robe like Sophia.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:10%
But he's also wearing
a white garment as well

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.470 align:middle line:10%
that is covered with acorns.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.870 align:middle line:90%
We get the message.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We are the acorn that is
growing into the magnificent oak

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.800 align:middle line:84%
tree, capable of
reaching into the stars

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and indeed becoming a
celestial or a star being.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:01.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just Christianity
or the Egyptian tradition

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:84%
or the Near Eastern
traditions that

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:84%
have this idea of the
resurrection of the body,

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the glorification of the
body, the transformation

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.550 align:middle line:90%
into the rainbow body of light.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.400 align:middle line:10%
It's also known to
the Maya as well.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:10%
And what we're looking at here
is a Maya resurrection plate,

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:10%
dated to around 680 BC
by an unknown artist

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:10%
in the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:10%
What we see here is what's
described as the Maya First

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Father.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The Maya depicted on
their funerary ceramics

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the miraculous moment when the
successful soul-- and I love

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that term because the successful
soul is the resurrected soul.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And we find that its
purpose is to remind

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the rebirth
it could win for itself.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is how
the Maya expressed

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.640 align:middle line:90%
this idea of resurrection.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And they would, in life,
create these plates

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that people could study,
contemplate, meditate,

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.420 align:middle line:90%
reflect on.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And then these
plates were placed

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:59.490 align:middle line:84%
in the tomb so in the
journey to the afterlife,

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:84%
the soul would be reminded
of what it's doing.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's resurrecting
itself from its shell.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here is the
transfigured and bejeweled

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:14.710 align:middle line:84%
First Father squeezing
upward through a crack

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmic turtle shell,
which symbolizes Earth.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the miraculous
moment of resurrection

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.190 align:middle line:84%
being portrayed in
the Maya tradition.

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:28.590 align:middle line:10%
So here we see the turtle
shell, symbolizing Earth life.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:10%
And then squeezing
out of it, we're

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:10%
going to see the first father
with his feathered headdress,

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:10%
emerging from the earth plane
from the material realm,

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.330 align:middle line:10%
entering into immaterial realm.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic turtle shell, says
Maya scholar David Gillette,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is the supernatural
maize kernel.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the divine spark,
the kernel of immortality

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that burst open to allow the
resurrection body to soar up

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.180 align:middle line:84%
from the realm of death into
the world of eternal life.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.740 align:middle line:10%
So this is the Maya
concept of resurrection,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:05.720 align:middle line:10%
of the emergence of the
divine spark within.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.610 align:middle line:10%
The First Father has
feathers sprouting

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:10%
from his headdress
that symbolize

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:13.170 align:middle line:10%
the leaves of the world
tree he is becoming.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:10%
Remember the acorn turning into
the oak, the world tree going

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:10%
onward and upward, branching
out into other realms

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:10%
and into other worlds.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So, a magnificent representation
of the successful soul,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.666 align:middle line:90%
the resurrected soul.

00:45:29.666 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:84%
This takes us over
to Botticelli,

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:84%
who will be the subject
of Clare's Beyond the Veil

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:90%
segment.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.380 align:middle line:84%
What is Venus doing but
coming out of her shell

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:90%
in a moment of resurrection?

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:10%
We'll leave that
for her to unveil

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.940 align:middle line:10%
all the other resurrection
symbolism in Botticelli's

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:49.440 align:middle line:10%
magnificent masterpiece here.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:10%
Jesus, of course, went through
this experience in his baptism,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:10%
where he emerges from the
water, home of the sea shell,

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and is then given, through
this cosmic vibration,

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:10%
his new cloak, or
garment, of light.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.940 align:middle line:10%


00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.640 align:middle line:10%
In Buddhism, this
divine spark, this seed,

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.480 align:middle line:10%
is called the "Adamantine
Nucleus of Radiant or Clear

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Light."

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:10%
That's a mouthful.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.700 align:middle line:10%
The term "Adamantine
Body" should

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.680 align:middle line:10%
remind us of Adam, because it
refers to our primordial body

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:10%
and also the Garden of Eden.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.960 align:middle line:10%
It refers to the
subtle body, also known

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:10%
as the "vajra body" or
the "diamond body"--

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.630 align:middle line:10%
very important concept,
also, to remember

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.860 align:middle line:10%
when Clare gets into her
Beyond the Veil segment.

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.290 align:middle line:10%
Growing or revealing
this body, according

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:39.230 align:middle line:10%
to Buddhist alchemists,
is the great work.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.350 align:middle line:10%
It is arcanum.

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's about awakening
the Adamantine body

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and attaining the divine
body or the vajra body,

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the body of light, expressed
in this beautiful illustration

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.075 align:middle line:90%
here from Buddhism.

00:46:53.075 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.950 align:middle line:10%
In closing for this
segment, I want

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:01.970 align:middle line:10%
to share with you an
amazing revelation.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
Greek word "adamas"

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.050 align:middle line:84%
means unbreakable
and unalterable.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Our soul truly is
unbreakable no matter

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:middle line:84%
what happens to us
on the Earth plane.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We are like that diamond,
unbreakable and unalterable.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Adamantine Land
is the Gnostic term

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.230 align:middle line:84%
for the Heavenly realm
out of which we emerge.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.710 align:middle line:84%
We are truly divine and
eternal beings, unbreakable,

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.012 align:middle line:90%
unalterable.

00:47:30.012 --> 00:47:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that this should give us

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.750 align:middle line:84%
confidence to reach out
and to try new things,

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we can't possibly
fail, in the eternal sense,

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.505 align:middle line:84%
because it's all about awakening
our soul's true potential.

00:47:42.505 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:10%
In esoteric Tibetan Buddhism,
Adamantine or Admantine Reality

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:54.920 align:middle line:10%
connotes an unimaginably hard
substance that is impenetrable,

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:10%
unbreakable, and
unyielding, as well as

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.470 align:middle line:10%
being directly
linked to diamonds.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.861 align:middle line:10%
This takes us to a really
interesting transfiguration

00:48:03.861 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:10%
image.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:10%
I took this photo in the
chapel at Roslin Chapel

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:10%
in Roslin, Scotland,
where we see

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.250 align:middle line:10%
Jesus in this
transfiguration scene

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.880 align:middle line:10%
with a diamond behind
him, indicating

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.400 align:middle line:10%
that he has attained the diamond
body of the Buddhist tradition,

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.880 align:middle line:10%
manifesting that light
body, that unalterable,

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.410 align:middle line:10%
unbreakable light body.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Below the disciples is a Latin
inscription and a dedication

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.810 align:middle line:10%
to James Francis Harry Sinclair,
the fifth Earl of Roslin.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.410 align:middle line:10%
The inscription
reads, "In Lumine tuo

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.360 align:middle line:10%
bidebimus lumen," which has been
translated as "In your light

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.870 align:middle line:10%
we shall see the divine light."

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the Gnostic
call-- in your light.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
In your light, we shall
see the divine light.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So let that diamond
within you glow.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Begin to radiate that
light with the confidence

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that you are a divine
and unalterable,

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.480 align:middle line:84%
unbreakable being
here on a mission

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to spread divine light and love.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And in closing, I want to share
a meditation I learned about

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.280 align:middle line:10%
from Jay Weidner in one
of his presentations,

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.290 align:middle line:10%
where he quotes Dr.
Brian Weiss, who

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.240 align:middle line:10%
says that during a
meditation or during a dream,

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.490 align:middle line:10%
he saw a diamond in everybody's
chest, a beautiful diamond

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:10%
with 1,000 facets.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's diamond
is the same, he said,

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:31.030 align:middle line:10%
but some of the diamonds are
covered with dirt or tar.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:34.070 align:middle line:10%
And the job of the
soul seems to be

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.600 align:middle line:10%
to clean the facets--
how beautiful.

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.860 align:middle line:10%
When all of the
facets are clean,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.960 align:middle line:10%
the pressure seems to
dissolve, and the diamond

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.080 align:middle line:10%
just radiates light, or
disperses into the universe.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.140 align:middle line:10%
Some people-- and
here's the key--

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.894 align:middle line:10%
have polished a lot of
the facets, maybe 900

00:49:52.894 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:10%
or 999, others only a few.

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.470 align:middle line:10%
They have a lot of work
to do, says Dr. Weiss.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.280 align:middle line:10%
Then he understood.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's diamond is the same.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:08.980 align:middle line:10%
1,000 facets and the
potential is exactly the same,

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:10%
and everybody is on
the same journey.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.070 align:middle line:10%
So let that light
shine within you.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Clean the facets
of your diamond,

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and let that light
shine through.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And as you allow
your light to shine,

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.110 align:middle line:84%
it allows my light to
shine greater, too.

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.228 align:middle line:90%
That's "Arcanum."

00:50:29.228 --> 00:50:32.090 align:middle line:10%

And now, in this segment
of Beyond the Veil,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:10%
Clare is going to take us closer
to the mysteries of the divine

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.340 align:middle line:10%
spark through the eyes of
the great Renaissance master

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.370 align:middle line:10%
Sandro Botticelli.

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.530 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE: In this segment
of Beyond the Veil,

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.610 align:middle line:10%
we are going to explore the
work of Sandro Botticelli,

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:10%
one of the definitive painters
of the Italian Renaissance,

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.990 align:middle line:10%
and a man who was not
only privy to arcanum,

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.440 align:middle line:10%
but he also painted it.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:11.200 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:10%
Born to a poor tanner in the
back streets of Florence,

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.920 align:middle line:10%
Alessandro Filipepi
was brought up

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.550 align:middle line:10%
by his brother, who
gave him the nickname

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:25.410 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli, meaning
little barrel.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.050 align:middle line:10%
The name stuck, and
Botticelli's art

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:10%
became the most intelligent,
creative, and recognizable

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:36.000 align:middle line:10%
voices of the
Florentine Renaissance

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.760 align:middle line:10%
that also saw the rise
of Donatello, Leonardo,

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:45.780 align:middle line:10%
Michelangelo, and Raphael,
amongst other great masters.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:10%
This painting is part of
an altarpiece commissioned

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:53.220 align:middle line:10%
for a convent for
repentant prostitutes.

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.910 align:middle line:10%
In the center is a vision
of the Trinity, God

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:00.900 align:middle line:10%
the father, a dove,
symbolizing the Holy Spirit,

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:10%
and Christ on the cross.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Flanking this
surprising apparition

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:10.370 align:middle line:84%
are John the Baptist,
patron Saint of Florence,

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene,
patroness of the convent.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.220 align:middle line:10%
By the late 1460s, Botticelli
had made a name for himself

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:10%
under the apprenticeship
of the great Filippo Lippi,

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:10%
where he was spotted by agents
of the most powerful family

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:33.340 align:middle line:10%
of the Renaissance, the
Medicis, who were also

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:38.020 align:middle line:10%
among history's
greatest mystic seekers.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.760 align:middle line:10%
The Medicis were immensely
wealthy and powerful.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.880 align:middle line:10%
They were obsessed with arcanum.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.290 align:middle line:84%
They hoped to create
a new Golden Age.

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli would help
them visualize it.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:58.960 align:middle line:84%
The Medicis considered
themselves modern-day Magi.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.860 align:middle line:84%
The Chapel of the Magi
occupies an important place

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.100 align:middle line:90%
in the Medici palace.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:08.970 align:middle line:10%
The chapel is famous for
this series of wall paintings

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:10%
by Benozzo Gozzoli,
with the angels

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.500 align:middle line:10%
in adoration in the
rectangular apse

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:10%
and the journey of the
Magi in the large hall.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.150 align:middle line:10%
On the north wall, in the
entourage of the Magi Caspar,

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:27.780 align:middle line:10%
is an ideal portrait
of Lorenzo de'

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.090 align:middle line:10%
Medici, the future magnifico.

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.630 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The meaning of Medici in
Italian is medical doctor,

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.420 align:middle line:84%
although some believe
it means magic.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:48.170 align:middle line:84%
In 1460, 14 books called
Corpus Hermeticum were covertly

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.440 align:middle line:84%
bought by a monk who
miraculously escaped

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.080 align:middle line:84%
the Byzantium siege in 1453
to the court of Cosimo de'

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Medici, ruler of Florence.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The central texts of
the Corpus Hermeticum

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:06.065 align:middle line:84%
were lost to the West
in classical times.

00:54:06.065 --> 00:54:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The Corpus Hermeticum
texts dwell

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.950 align:middle line:84%
upon the oneness
and goodness of God,

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:21.640 align:middle line:84%
urge purification of the soul,
and defend religious practices

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.500 align:middle line:84%
such as the
veneration of images.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.695 align:middle line:84%
The image itself will
show you the way,

00:54:29.695 --> 00:54:30.820 align:middle line:90%
says the Corpus Hermeticum.

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:10%
Written by unknown
authors in Egypt

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:40.360 align:middle line:10%
sometime before the end
of the 3rd century CE,

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.780 align:middle line:10%
the Corpus Hermeticum
were part of

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.840 align:middle line:10%
a once-substantial
literature attributed

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.010 align:middle line:10%
to the mythic figure
of Hermes Trismegistus,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:54.300 align:middle line:10%
a Hellenistic fusion
of the Greek god Hermes

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.280 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptian god Thoth.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Corpus Hermeticum was
translated by Marsilio Ficino.

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.750 align:middle line:84%
In order to get
arcanum, we must get

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to know this Renaissance Magi.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:16.950 align:middle line:10%
High priest, physician,
musician, magician, astrologer,

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:22.260 align:middle line:10%
and Christian, he was the
original Renaissance man.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:28.550 align:middle line:84%
He is featured in Ghirlandaio's
"An Angel Visits Zechariah."

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:32.840 align:middle line:10%
He also appears in a scene
showing Plato and Ficnino

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.610 align:middle line:10%
with Hermes in Sienna Cathedral.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:10%
Ficino and his successors
regarded Hermes Trismegistus

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.910 align:middle line:10%
as a contemporary of Moses.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:49.240 align:middle line:10%
And his teachings were seen as a
perennial philosophy, predating

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.990 align:middle line:10%
yet anticipating
Christianity with its roots

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.960 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Egypt.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:02.040 align:middle line:84%
For him, Jesus was the exemplar
of ultimate human potential.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.090 align:middle line:84%
He sought to fuse
Christianity with its roots.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:09.370 align:middle line:10%
Bellini's "Blood
of the Redeemer"

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:12.080 align:middle line:10%
shows Jesus in the foreground.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.830 align:middle line:10%
In the background, the
caduceus wand of arcanum

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:20.615 align:middle line:10%
is passed off,
suggesting the torch had

00:56:20.615 --> 00:56:22.143 align:middle line:10%
been passed to Christianity.

00:56:22.143 --> 00:56:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Ficino realized
that Christianity

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:30.410 align:middle line:84%
was a variation,
an interpretation

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:33.300 align:middle line:84%
of a group of followers
of the Corpus Hermeticum,

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.750 align:middle line:84%
specifically the
cult of Serapis.

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Ficino also revived Platonism,
the philosophy of Plato.

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.960 align:middle line:84%
The human soul originated
in the higher world

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:51.490 align:middle line:84%
but is trapped in the
body, in the lower world.

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And Plato's writing
sometimes described

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:57.100 align:middle line:84%
the return, or
ascent, of the soul

00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:84%
to its true, perfect home, the
unity of the one that is God.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:09.790 align:middle line:10%
Ficino wrote and performed music
that drew down or attracted

00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:14.130 align:middle line:10%
stellar influences, the
music of the spheres.

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.970 align:middle line:10%
This was possible
because the human soul

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:20.300 align:middle line:10%
is made of star
stuff, he taught.

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.330 align:middle line:10%
Ficino wrote extensively
about techniques

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:26.620 align:middle line:10%
whereby planetary powers
were to be invoked

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.600 align:middle line:10%
by the principles
of Hermetic analogy.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.450 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.150 align:middle line:10%
As within, so without.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:38.940 align:middle line:10%
This is the Hermetic
law of Ficino.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:10%


00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:10%
Ficino believed he could draw
down the power of the stars

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.860 align:middle line:10%
and planets to aid in
his spiritual evolution.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.190 align:middle line:84%
We are trapped on
Earth, he believed.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The only way out was to
refine the soul and descend

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.570 align:middle line:90%
to the Heavenly realms.

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Ficino wrote extensively
about techniques

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.670 align:middle line:84%
whereby planetary powers
were to be invoked

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.840 align:middle line:84%
by principles of
Hermetic analogy.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Chiefly accused of
being his follower,

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and the man who
incorporated this knowledge

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:21.260 align:middle line:84%
in his paintings, was
Sandro Botticelli.

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli would help
the Medicis visualize

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the new Golden Age,
and in so doing,

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:84%
is credited with creating
a whole new genre of art.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.300 align:middle line:10%
Embedded symbolism
and private jokes

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:40.220 align:middle line:10%
characterize this new
genre; so did the intention

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:46.030 align:middle line:10%
to draw down planetary
powers into his art.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:50.320 align:middle line:10%
Renaissance art, including
Raphael, but particularly

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:10%
that of Botticelli,
can only be understood

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:59.290 align:middle line:10%
with this magical knowledge,
or arcanum, in mind.

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Known also as "The
Madonna of the Book,"

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.870 align:middle line:84%
this painting represents
the Virgin and child

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in a domestic setting.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Intent on reading a volume,
perhaps the Book of Love,

00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Jesus holds a golden crown
and three shafts of light.

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.936 align:middle line:84%
These could represent the
triple shafts of enlightenment.

00:59:20.936 --> 00:59:24.530 align:middle line:90%


00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:29.060 align:middle line:10%
"The Magnificat" fused
Botticelli's Christian beliefs

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.540 align:middle line:10%
with Renaissance
naturalistic style.

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Mary wears
her cloak of many colors.

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Two angels place a
plasma-like crown on her head.

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:44.950 align:middle line:84%
The title of the painting
derives from the word

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:48.680 align:middle line:84%
"magnificat," which is written
in the book held by the two

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.540 align:middle line:90%
angels.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Mary is completing the last
words of the prayer as her son

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:59.890 align:middle line:90%
guides her hand.

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:04.760 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli befriended the heirs
to the Medici empire, Lorenzo

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.960 align:middle line:10%
and his brother Guiliano.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.490 align:middle line:10%
Lorenzo's court, and
indeed all of Florence,

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:16.410 align:middle line:10%
was crowded with secret
groups and shadowy societies.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Florentine coppersmith
Bartelomeo Masi

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.760 align:middle line:84%
recorded in his
diary in April 1492

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that as Lorenzo de'
Medici lay dying,

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
a violent storm damaged
the duomo's bell

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
tower and buildings in the
Palazzo Medici neighborhood.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The storm was caused by
the release of a demon

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:44.395 align:middle line:84%
that Lorenzo had kept imprisoned
in a ring for many years.

01:00:44.395 --> 01:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%


01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:51.740 align:middle line:10%
An unusually bright star loomed
over the villa at Careggi,

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:57.230 align:middle line:10%
fell, and disappeared at the
moment of Lorenzo's death.

01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:01.000 align:middle line:10%
Lorenzo has been called
"an heir to King Solomon"

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.880 align:middle line:10%
for his ability to
magically bind demons

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.780 align:middle line:10%
and draw planetary influences
into engraved stones.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.810 align:middle line:10%
It is claimed that he
sought these powers

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.630 align:middle line:10%
to assure his souls' ascension.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.170 align:middle line:10%


01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli's "La Primavera"
was neither portrait, icon,

01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.110 align:middle line:10%
nor holy celebration.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:29.230 align:middle line:10%
It was pure fantasy,
inspired by poetry

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:33.460 align:middle line:10%
and felled by a
vivid imagination.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.030 align:middle line:10%
This much-analyzed
painting shows

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Venus, ancient goddess
of beauty and fertility,

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.650 align:middle line:10%
celebrating the arrival
of spring, la primavera.

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:50.060 align:middle line:10%
She is surrounded by
allegorical figures representing

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.495 align:middle line:10%
the virtues and gods
of the ancient world.

01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:56.060 align:middle line:10%


01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.230 align:middle line:10%
"The Birth of Venus" was unlike
any other painting of its time.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:06.850 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli presents us with
a beautiful world to enter.

01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Featuring the
goddess of love, it

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
was designed to be hung
above the marital bed.

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It was a daring celebration
of human desire.

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Previous to this, it was
unheard of to see a woman,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
save for Eve, in the nude.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The painting was
so controversial it

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
was kept behind closed
doors for half a century.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It is considered one of
the most iconic pieces

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:39.730 align:middle line:90%
in the history of Western art.

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Metallic gold is
everywhere in the painting.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It's in zephyr's wings
and in the tree leaves.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The entwined zephyr push
the winds to the goddess.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:54.620 align:middle line:90%


01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Our eye is drawn to Venus
coming out of her shell.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
According to many
analysts, Botticelli

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
is depicting the spiritual
beauty of the soul.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli paints
Venus being born

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
from the philosophical sea.

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
This represents
the divine spark.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It has the same meaning
as the Mayan resurrection

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
scene of the First Father
emerging from the turtle shell

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:29.050 align:middle line:90%
or Earth life.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Like Botticelli's
other masterpiece,

01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
"Pallas and the Centaur,"
"The Birth of Venus"

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is painted on canvas,
fairly unusual for its time,

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
using a technique
of thin tempura,

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
based on the use of diluted
egg yolk, which lends itself

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
particularly well to give
the painting that aspect

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.750 align:middle line:90%
of extraordinary transparency.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.470 align:middle line:90%


01:03:55.470 --> 01:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Why is Venus being
mantled with red?

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
An answer is found in alchemy,
where a white phase, called

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Venus, precedes
going to redness.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Here we recall that
Wisdom's mantle is red.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Is Venus being
cloaked in wisdom?

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:26.540 align:middle line:84%
In 1482, the Medici
family commissioned

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Sandro Botticelli's painting
of "Pallas and the Centaur."

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%
This is Athena in all her glory.

01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The painting, cited as
"Camilla and a Satyr"

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.862 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in the interior
of the so-called Old

01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
House of the family in a
room on the ground floor,

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
alongside the chamber of
Lorenzo de Pierre Francisco,

01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
together with the "Primavera,"
also by Botticelli.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It was hung high above the door
leading to the antechamber.

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:07.560 align:middle line:10%
Athena is wearing a light
gown, white and transparent,

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.150 align:middle line:10%
decorated with
diamond-tipped tipped rings.

01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:14.510 align:middle line:10%
She is wrapped in a
large green cloak.

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:19.390 align:middle line:10%
A mesh of olive shoots encircles
her shoulders, arms, breast,

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:24.070 align:middle line:10%
and thighs, forming a sort of
vegetable breast plate, which

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:27.650 align:middle line:10%
makes her gown
cling to the body.

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli decorated
the goddess' delicious

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:36.090 align:middle line:10%
dress with a diamond ring
and the three-ring symbol

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:41.240 align:middle line:10%
of the Medici, which is also
the symbol of the Cintamani,

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.210 align:middle line:10%
or wish-fulfilling jewel.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:47.800 align:middle line:10%
The points where
the branches cross

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.120 align:middle line:10%
are fixed with diamond-tipped
rings, while on her nipples

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.900 align:middle line:10%
are two mounted diamonds.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:00.610 align:middle line:10%
This indicates she is in
her light, or diamond, body.

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:03.550 align:middle line:10%
Her long, thick,
blonde tresses are

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:07.490 align:middle line:10%
adorned with a wreath of
entwined olive branches

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:10.180 align:middle line:10%
with a diamond at the top
within a four-leaf setting.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:14.874 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.874 --> 01:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Clare, that
was incredible-- Sandro

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Botticelli and the diamond body.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Arcanum."

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.010 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:32.967 align:middle line:10%
