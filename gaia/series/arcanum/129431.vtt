00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello,
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We are all on a journey
of self-transformation

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:90%
and a quest for soul ascension.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the journey feels
lonely but rest assured,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:90%
we are never alone.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Many, many others are
ascending the same path

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
as we are and many more
have gone ahead of us

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:90%
to show us the way.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Some have even returned
to show others the way.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
This journey is an evolution
from ego-based life

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to soul-based life, to a
cosmic or enlightened life,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:90%
the awakened soul.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It seems like this
journey is linear

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and has a beginning and an end.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it's
a circular journey

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that is not about finding
something at a future time

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
but instead is about
remembering who we originally

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:90%
were and already are.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Mythologically speaking,
our soul's journey

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:90%
is called the "hero's journey."

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:10%
The hero's journey is one that
author Joseph Campbell brought

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:10%
to life in 1949
when he published

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:10%
his first book, "The Hero
with a Thousand Faces."

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Campbell had traveled deep
into comparative religion

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and mythology the world
over and discovered

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
dozens of coded stories
of ancient myths told

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
by visionaries who
spoke in symbols

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:90%
that crossed time and cultures.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
He returned with the realization
that all the great heroes

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
were all the same hero.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
More, he discovered a
formula or a framework

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.120 align:middle line:90%
that all these stories followed.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:84%
All the great stories,
he proclaimed,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:90%
are really only one story.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
He called it the "monomyth"
or the "hero's journey."

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It also provides the structure
of some of the greatest

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
movies ever made,
including "The Matrix,"

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
"Star Wars," "The Lion King,"
"Rocky," and many, many more.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
At its core, the hero's
journey maps the progression

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
of a person from a normal
person in an ordinary world

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to a higher, ascended
state of consciousness

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
through a series of
trials and tribulations.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It is often
represented as a circle

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's a cycle
that repeats and repeats

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:90%
and repeats.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Our exploration of
the Hero's Journey

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
will be from a slightly
different perspective

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
from others, in that I
will endeavor to view it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:90%
from the viewpoint of the soul.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
The Hero's Journey
is a story describing

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
the universal journey that
an ordinary soul goes through

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in order to attain
victory in their own life

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:90%
and to complete their ascension.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to ask you to
think about it in terms

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:10%
of your own soul journey and
how your birth, life, trials,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.450 align:middle line:10%
tribulations, and ultimate
ascension follows this pattern.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I think you will find
the hero's journey is

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
a truly powerful tool to
help understand our soul's

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
incarnation and to navigate
our cosmic travels.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:10%
In a moment, I will share
with you the Gnostic text

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:10%
"The Song of the Pearl," which
is about the soul's journey,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:10%
and we will see
that it precisely

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:10%
follows Campbell's map.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:10%
The hero's journey
usually has 12 steps so

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:10%
let's begin by taking
a look at them.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.690 align:middle line:10%
The hero's journey
begins with the hero

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:10%
in her ordinary world, the
comfort zone, the normal world.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
If we think of the circular
hero's journey as a clock,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
this is 12:00.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
At 12:00, our soul is
in the celestial realms,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:90%
its point of origin.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Our hero is restless, maybe
wishing for a higher calling.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Something may be missing
in her life, but what?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Usually, she's oblivious
to what is to come.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:84%
1:00-- the hero's
adventure begins

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
when she receives
a call to action,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
such as a threat to her safety,
her family, her way of life.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It could be a phone
call, an email.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the call
is, it shakes up

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
the ordinary world of
the hero and presents

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
a challenge, a quest
for a journey that

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
must be undertaken.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
In Campbell's research, he
noted that often, the hero

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:90%
refuses to accept the quest.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
She has fears,
worries, or doubts.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%
She prefers the comfort of home.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps the problem
ahead seems too big,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:90%
her fear too unfaceable.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
2:00-- at this stage, the
hero needs assistance.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.810 align:middle line:84%
She's still in the
ordinary world of the soul,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
seeking courage and motivation
or something, whatever it is.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
This something is provided by
the mentor figure who suddenly

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:90%
manifests and offers it to her.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Often, this is a book
or a piece of advice.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
This figure can be a friend,
a family member, a colleague,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
or a stranger, a
blog that suddenly

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
appears with a key piece
of information, advice,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
or even direction.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Soul translation here--
the mentor figure

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
is actually our
angelic higher self.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:90%
At

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
3:00, the hero is now
ready to take the next step

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and act upon her
call to adventure.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
"crossing the threshold."

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
She leaves the ordinary
world of the soul

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and enters the unknown
country, the faraway land.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Soul translation--
this is the moment

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
when our soul leaves
its cosmic home.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Call it "heaven" or
"the other world."

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The soul is originally
composed of light

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and when it crosses the
border or threshold,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
it leaves behind
this known world

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:84%
when it incarnates
on Earth and enters

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
the unknown world of
flesh, which we think

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:90%
of as "the ordinary world."

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
4:00-- having left the
ordinary world behind,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.280 align:middle line:90%
there's now no turning back.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, the hero or
heroine, the hero in soul,

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
must overcome
challenges, travails,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and tests thrown her way
on the road of soul trials.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Challenges are the
food of the soul.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell said
that "Opportunities

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to find deeper powers
within ourselves comes when

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:90%
life seems most challenging."

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
It's at this point
that allies begin

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to appear, too, fellow
souls, fellow wanderers,

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:90%
fellow questers.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The soul awakens
to its predicament.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
It realizes it's
trapped in matter.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Its powers are diminished.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It now has a flesh-and-blood
body, not a light body,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and it longs for its
long-forgotten home.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
5:00-- as she progresses
towards her ultimate goal,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the hero approaches
the inmost cave

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
where the ultimate big
battle will take place.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
This is where the hero gathers
her forces in preparation

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:90%
for the big ordeal.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The cave is called "the dragon's
cave," "the dragon's lair."

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the dark night of the soul.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the place of
the soul's rebirth

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.865 align:middle line:84%
and the place for once and
for all cracking the reptilian

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:90%
code.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
06:00-- "the supreme ordeal,"
as Campbell calls it,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
is where the hero faces her
greatest fear or most deadly

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
enemy and the possibility
of certain death.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:84%
In this crisis,
the soul is called

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
upon to utilize all
her skills and wisdom

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
gained from previous
smaller challenges.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't have to be
a negative situation.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:90%
The ave could be your desk.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The ordeal is
staring at the phone

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.135 align:middle line:84%
and being afraid to call the
person you just met who you

00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
know will be your future wife.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell said, "The
cave you fear to enter

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
holds the treasure you seek."

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So take a moment to think about,
what is your greatest fear?

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
What are you dying to do
that you haven't done?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen
if you left it undone?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
The promise here is that by
experiencing a sort of death

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
to the old, limited self,
the hero can be reborn,

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a metaphorical
resurrection that

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
gives her even more
spiritual power than before.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the soul beginning
to remember and acquire

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
its light-body
powers, especially

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
instant materialization
of wishes.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
7:00-- after conquering
the big ordeal,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
the hero is now transformed
into a new state of being

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and she has a treasure
to prove it, too.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The treasure was gained
by slaying the dragon

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
in the inmost cave.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Soul translation-- I believe the
treasure is the robe of glory

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and the other soul apps,
as we have discussed,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
for these are the
superpowers of the soul that

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:90%
are needed to be reborn.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
In this image, we
see Padmasambhava,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow-bodied guru,
riding on a serpent.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The treasure he gained
by conquering the serpent

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is the rainbow body
of light and this is

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
our ultimate earthly treasure.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
8:00-- next comes
the return home.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
This is where Campbell
often saw that there

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
may be one or more
surprising remaining tests

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
or challenges before the door
of return to the ordinary world

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%
of the soul opens.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
dragon that was slayed

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
is reborn for one last
fight or the enemy

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
we thought we defeated
suddenly attacks or manifests.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Often, Campbell
noted, at this turn,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
the hero must choose between
their own personal goals

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and that of a higher goal.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Choosing the higher goal
raises the stakes considerably.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, with
everything on the line,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
the hero faces her final test
and most powerful encounter

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%
with death.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
This surprise rebirth of our
foe is actually a critical test.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Our mentor or higher
self wants to be sure

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that we learned the lesson
so a pop quiz is called.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:84%
When I used to do
consultations for people,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:84%
often, I would help them to
identify their challenges,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:90%
their dragons.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
we would seek

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to identify how they knew the
challenges had been overcome.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I did this by asking
two questions,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
one, how will your
life be different

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
when the challenge is overcome?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
What new things will you
be doing then mentally,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:84%
physically, spiritually,
and emotionally that you're

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:90%
presently not doing?

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage them to
write down these new things.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Make a long list and
then list them out

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
from perceived
easiest to perceived

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
most difficult. And then,
begin doing those things.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to get a snowball
effect going by doing

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:90%
the little things first.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.210 align:middle line:84%
The second question I
would ask is, at what point

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:84%
does the marathon runner know
if they have trained enough

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:90%
for the marathon?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't a trick question.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The answer is the
marathon runner

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
knows when they have trained
enough for the marathon

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
when they finish the race.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The message is we
don't know if we

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
have prepared enough
for a challenge

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:90%
until we actually overcome it.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
These questions always yielded
wonderful results for people.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The race, the marathon of
life, is the inmost cave

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:90%
for the marathon runner.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Crossing the finish line, she
emerges from the cave reborn.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
If she is given an award, this
physical token or treasure--

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
say, a gold cup-- is merely
symbolic of the inner treasure,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the inner gold she has
gained, for the treasure

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is a reward for past
achievement but it's also

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:90%
a tool for future use.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
As we have said, the golden
light body and other ascension

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
apps is the earthly reward
for the successful soul.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
It's what we ultimately
seek to attain.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
9:00-- the final stage
of the hero's journey

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.000 align:middle line:90%
is the return home.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
It's at this point
that the hero reflects

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:90%
on their self-transformation.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
This is when the soul
crosses the threshold

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and re-enters the
heavenly realm.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the ascension.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
The hero, the soul,
what Campbell would now

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
call "the master of two
worlds," has come full-circle

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and returned to
the ordinary world.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Only now, the soul is
awakened and is now

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:84%
referred to as a "traveler"
and she has a story to tell

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:57.094 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom to share with the
dwellers of the ordinary world.

00:12:57.094 --> 00:13:02.090 align:middle line:84%
10:00-- she has been transformed
by the quest on Earth

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and her soul has
now been upgraded.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And she now gets a new, even
more improved light body.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
11:00-- everything starts to
come together and make sense,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.210 align:middle line:84%
the reason for the
journey, all the ups

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and downs and the
trials and tribulations.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And at 12:00, the
hero begins life

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in the new, upgraded
ordinary world.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
During the hero's
journey, we find

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
a pattern and that
is the lowest become

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the highest and the
highest become the lowest.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard that before?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:90%
If so, what does this mean?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of it
in terms of school.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We start out in kindergarten
at the lowest level.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as we go from first grade to
sixth grade, from low to high,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:90%
we're making this transition.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But we can't stay in sixth
grade because we graduate

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:84%
to the next higher
level, seventh grade,

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
where we're now low again
until we reach ninth grade,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:90%
when we're high again.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Low has become high and
high has become low.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But we don't stay in
ninth grade, either.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
We now graduate to the 10th
grade, where we're low again

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be so until the
12th grade, when we really

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
think we know it all.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, we graduate out into
the open life, if you will.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
In life, the clear graduation
shifts are not clearly marked

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
but they're still there.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We're still on the
hero's journey.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
We're still low becoming
high and high becoming low.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But by learning to read
these circumstances,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
we can better
navigate Earth life.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the map the
hero's journey provides

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
because every situation and
relationship in our lives

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:90%
is somewhere on this path.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.410 align:middle line:84%
By determining
where we are at, we

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.130 align:middle line:90%
can navigate our way forward.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
If we upgrade this
map to the soul level,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
it's equally valuable,
maybe even more so.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.390 align:middle line:84%
From this brief exploration
of the hero's journey,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.190 align:middle line:84%
we can see why stories
are vital to our soul.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
If the story of a people is
controlled or incomplete,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
it will be hard for
them to move forward.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Politicians refer to this as
"controlling the narrative."

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
If they can control the story,
they can control the people.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if they change the
story, they change the people.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we
are told we have no souls

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we live and
we die and that's it,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:84%
then one kind of
life will be lived.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
One kind of culture
will be experienced.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the scientific viewpoint.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.700 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if we
are told that we have a soul

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and that after we die, we
are reborn again and again

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and again, a different
kind of life will be lived.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
A different kind of
culture will emerge.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:90%
This is the spiritual viewpoint.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
If we are told that the way
to leave this eternal ring

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
or cycle of rebirths
is to ascend

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
by living our light body
as a state of being,

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
then yet a third kind
of life will be lived.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the life the
awakened soul is seeking.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we have
seen, the Tibetans

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
teach that the only way
to ascend from Earth

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
is for the divine
spark, our soul,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to spin the flesh-and-blood
body into a rainbow light body.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the hero's quest
from the Tibetan perspective.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And from their perspective, we
have all been spending lifetime

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
after lifetime working
on this realization,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
perhaps reincarnating over
millennia to learn what we are

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:90%
discussing at this very moment.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Our learning is cumulative, they
say, and we carry it with us.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The light body and
the ascension can

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
be attained in one
lifetime, say the Tibetans,

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and it may even be
in this lifetime.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of us believe
that we can do this.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
We believe we can ascend.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.387 align:middle line:90%
Others don't.

00:16:58.387 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And this reminds me of the
story of the two caterpillars

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:90%
chatting on Facebook.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful butterfly
suddenly floats by.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
One caterpillar
says to the other,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.139 align:middle line:84%
"You'll never get me up in one
of those butterfly things."

00:17:10.139 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is our
essential predicament.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
We don't believe we
can morph and ascend

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:90%
and we resist morphing.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of it.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, some of us don't.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:90%
But seeing is believing.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So what we really need
is a vision, a goal.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:90%
We need to see the way forward.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We need a North Star
in the sky to guide us.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the images of
ascended beings that we have

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:90%
been exploring are North Stars.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that these
images can hand off

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the codes for our own ascension
make them even more powerful.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
"Where the mind goes,
the biology follows,"

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
says psychologist
Dr. Mario Martinez.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And for the human species
to achieve ascension

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
and transcendence, we must have
stories, plots, narratives,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and images that can guide
us from initial conception

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
to the final goal.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the
Gnostics rehearsed stories

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:84%
like "The Vision of Isaiah"
and "The Song of the Pearl--

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
or "The Robe of Glory," as it's
also known-- over and over.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
"The Song of the
Pearl was written

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
by a little known Syriac
mystic named Bardesanes

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:90%
around 150 to 233 AD.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's found in the
apocryphal Acts of Thomas

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and it describes
the soul's descent

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
into matter and its
return or ascension.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
"The Song of the Pearl"
tells us of the hero

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Thomas's attainment
or acquisition

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
of a glorious robe
or garment of light

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and his soul rising or
ascending to the throne of God.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
It says, "And I stretched
forth and received it.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
With the beauty of its
colors, I adorned myself.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And in my royal robe,
excelling in beauty,

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I arrayed myself wholly,"
reads "The Song of the Pearl."

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, Thomas's
name means "twin"

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and he's believed to
be the twin of Jesus.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:84%
This story, "The Song of the
Pearl" or "Hymn of the Pearl,"

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
told the Gnostics what
to do and how to do it.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The repetition of
these "mind trips,"

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
as they were
thought of, actually

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
actualized ascension as a
reality for the Gnostics,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
who were unwavering
in their belief

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
that they would receive the robe
of the glorious rainbow light.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I call this
an ascension simulation text.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Our souls come from
what Campbell would

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.525 align:middle line:90%
call "the ordinary world."

00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The ordinary world of
the soul is not on Earth.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It is elsewhere.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Fascinatingly, the
Gnostics believed

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the seed of light or divine
spark, the essence of our soul,

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
was ejected from the center
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Our soul drop washed ashore on
Earth like a fish out of water.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And once on Earth, it grew
the physical body as a vehicle

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:84%
for incarnation but
also for ascension.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Human beings enter Earth
through the womb and while

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in the nurturing
waters of the womb,

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the divine spark encases itself
in the human fleshly garment.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just inches away
from a new domain.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It begins to absorb the
rhythms of this place.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, it enters the
birth canal, the portal,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:90%
or the light stargate.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And once we are born into
Earth life, many, if not most,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:84%
souls forget the
former ordinary world.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But in effect, our
bodies and brains

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
are a device or vessel birthed
by our divine spark out of DNA

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to act as information-gathering
equipment, as well

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:84%
as earthly
transportation vehicles

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and as energy harvesting
and processing devices.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, the
divine spark is

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
capable of morphing our
bodies into a star or light

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
gate for re-entrance to the
ordinary world and to be

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%
able to function there.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
In "The Song of the
Pearl," we learn

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the soul comes to Earth
equipped for its journey.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
From the wealth of its
treasury, Thomas's soul

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
is given coverings for
its descent into creation.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
These coverings are made of
gold, silver, rubies, agate,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and adamant, forming a
garment which can crush iron.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
A pun is indicated here,
as "adamant" is immovable,

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.230 align:middle line:84%
unyielding, and so is
the soul's isolation

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
from its source in divinity
once in the human body.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:10%
These five jewels
I've just indicated

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.260 align:middle line:10%
correspond to the five
layers of the soul

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:10%
we explored in the "Robe
of the Soul" episode.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
In the poem, just
before Thomas descends

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
universe, his parents

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
removed his bright
robe and purple toga.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The bright robe is the
light of the soul that

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is removed or forgotten
once we incarnate

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and the purple toga symbolizes
royalty or divinity.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
garments put on Jesus

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:90%
just before the crucifixion.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:10%
Jesus discusses the
light of the soul when

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:10%
he tells the disciples
in the book of Matthew

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:10%
to shine brightly.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
"You are the light of the world.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
A city that is set on
a hill cannot be hit.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Neither do men light a candle
and put it under a bushel,

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:10%
but on a candlestick
and giveth light unto

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:10%
all that are in the house.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.450 align:middle line:10%
So let yours shine
before men that they

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:10%
may see your good works and
glorify your father which

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:10%
is in heaven."

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Thomas's parents
made a deal with him

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and wrote it in
his heart that when

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:84%
he gets to Egypt,
the human world,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.513 align:middle line:84%
and he finds the one pearl which
is in the midst of the sea--

00:22:37.513 --> 00:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
a Gnostic term for
consciousness--

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and guarded by a loud, breathing
serpent, that he could once

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
again put on his bright robe.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Finding the pearl is clearly
the purpose of human incarnation

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and the pearl is "gnosis"
or "spiritual enlightenment"

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
or knowledge of life force,
of the soul, the divine spark.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And when it is found, so
too is the robe of the soul.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
The use of the pearl as a mystic
metaphor is highly instructive.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Pearls are formed when an alien
substance slips into an oyster

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:90%
between its mantle and shell.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Rather like getting a splinter,
the oyster's natural reaction

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is to cover up the
irritant to protect itself.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.860 align:middle line:84%
The mantle covers the
irritant with layers

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:90%
of a substance called "nacre."

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And looking at an
oyster, one would never

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:84%
know that concealed
within its shell

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
is such a precious,
iridescent treasure.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.740 align:middle line:84%
"Iridescent" means "displaying
a play of lustrous colors

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
like those of a rainbow,"
hence the parallels

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:90%
to the human soul in the body.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
This idea makes a lot
of sense and examples

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of the pearl
symbolizing the soul

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and our spiritual goal,
the rainbow body, abound.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.343 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, we found the blue
pearl in the third eye

00:23:53.343 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:90%
of Padmasambhava.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The message is that meditating
on the blue pearl within,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:90%
we can manifest our light body.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Here are Jesus's
words in Matthew 7:6.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
"Give not that which
is holy unto dogs,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:84%
neither cast your
pearls before swine."

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And again in Matthew, he
says, "The kingdom of heaven

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is like unto a merchant man,
seeking goodly pearls, who,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
when he had found one
pearl of great price,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:84%
went and sold all that
he had, and bought it."

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is clearly telling
us that the pearl of gnosis

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and the robe of light
that is discovered with it

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
is of such immense value that
it exceeds all the other pearls

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:90%
or aspirations of this world.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the cost, we
want to acquire that pearl

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:90%
and that robe of light.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.966 align:middle line:84%
Also, Jesus clearly
advised his discernment

00:24:44.966 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
deciding to whom

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:90%
we choose to reveal our pearl.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
For some, we'll want to continue
to wear the iridescent self

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.839 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:24:52.839 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And don't bother trying
to convince those trapped

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in worldly affairs that
focusing on the pearl

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is the only real
treasure that counts.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're at 5:00
now in the story

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and here is the
source of the drama

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in "The Hymn of the Pearl" as
Thomas forgets his pearl when

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
he incarnates on Earth.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It happens when he goes to
live among the Egyptians, those

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
who have no interest in
anything but the physical world.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:90%
He puts on their garb to fit in.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Even so, they know
there's something

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:84%
different about Thomas
and they trick him

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:90%
into eating their food.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Before he knows it, Thomas has
forgotten his divine lineage,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
his pearl, and his soul has
fallen into a deep sleep.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:90%
He's as good as dead.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
However, Thomas,
like all of us, is

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
fortunate in that
some noble beings are

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:90%
watching from on high.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.390 align:middle line:10%
And they send their lost
soul a wake-up call,

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.284 align:middle line:10%
saying in "The Hymn of the
Pearl," "From thy father,

00:25:50.284 --> 00:25:51.700 align:middle line:10%
the king of kings,
and thy mother,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.000 align:middle line:10%
the mistress of the east,
and from thy brother,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:10%
our next in rank,
to thee our son,

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:10%
who art in Egypt, greeting!

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Up and arise from
thy sleep, and listen

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:10%
to the words of our letter!

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:10%
Call to mind that thou
art a son of kings!

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:10%
See the slavery-- and
whom thou servest!

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Remember the pearl for which
thou didst speed to Egypt!

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Think of thy bright
robe, and remember

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:10%
thy glorious toga,
which thou shall put on

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:10%
as thine adornment.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Thy name is named
in the book of life,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:10%
and with thy brother,
whom thou has received,

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:10%
thou shalt return
to our kingdom."

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:84%
This letter is a mystic wake-up
call for Thomas, as well as

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:90%
for all of us.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:90%
The voice says, remember.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Remember you are a divine
spark trapped in a body.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Remember the pearl.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember the robe of light
and the other soul apps.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Remember home.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, in Thomas's story,
the letter morphs into an eagle

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and flies beside Thomas
and it begins speaking.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And Thomas wakes up
and kisses the bird

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.570 align:middle line:90%
and listens to its message.

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a reversal of the story
of Prometheus, as we explored,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
where the eagle eats the
hero's liver every day.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The appearance of
the talking eagle

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:84%
tells us there's an
initiation going on here

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:84%
as, in spiritual symbolism,
the eagle is considered

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:90%
the highest of all birds.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
It is similar to the shining,
white-winged dove that

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:90%
appeared at Jesus's baptism.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The talking bird that
comes from on high

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:84%
actually symbolizes
the messenger of light.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It is this heavenly
light twin that

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
came to remind Thomas
of how to return home.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "I
remembered that I

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:84%
was a son of kings and
my free soul longed

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.150 align:middle line:90%
for its natural state.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the
pearl, for which

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
I had been sent to Egypt."

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:84%
The term "free soul" was also
used by the Native Americans

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
in their path of
soul's instruction.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Thomas remembered
the pearl and the reason

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
why he had been sent to Egypt
and his soul began to awaken.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:00.210 align:middle line:84%
6:00-- in the supreme
ordeal, Thomas

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:84%
quickly subdues the
serpent guarding the pearl

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.720 align:middle line:90%
with the name of God.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
7:00-- he snatches the
pearl, strips himself

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of his earthly garb,
and leaves Egypt.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:10%
At 8:00, he's headed
home, following

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:10%
the light of a letter.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Just then, Thomas sees
the messenger or awakener

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:90%
on the road before him.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:10%
"Shining before me in a
garment of radiance, glistening

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.280 align:middle line:10%
like royal silk, and with
its voice and its guidance,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:10%
it also encouraged me to
speed and with his love,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:10%
was drawing me on high."

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:84%
The awakener that
talks to the soul

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is the second part of
the Gnostic trinity,

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:90%
the messenger of light.

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And this story tells us that
planted within our hearts

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and present within
us is a higher

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:90%
mind, the messenger of light.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:10%
This messenger is a helper
that descends from above

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:10%
and is considered
our light twin.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of Philip, we
find an explicit reference

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to the messenger and the beaming
garment together and their role

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.160 align:middle line:90%
in our ascension.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, "You have
joined the perfect,

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:90%
the light with the holy spirit.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Unite the angels with
us also, the images.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And do not despise the
lamb, for without it, it

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is not possible to go
see the king and no one

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.720 align:middle line:84%
will be able to see the
king if he is naked."

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
For the Gnostic authors
of Philip and other texts,

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was clearly a being who
was transposed or translated

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
from the realm or land of
light and he was sent here

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
to awaken us to the existence
of our messenger and our Christ

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.790 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics are adamant
that until we link the higher

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
self and the lower
self, we're going

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:84%
to remain on Earth eternally
returning or recurring here.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So now, this brings us to
the really big question.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.246 align:middle line:84%
How do we open a channel
with this messenger?

00:29:50.246 --> 00:29:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I'll begin to answer
with an anecdote.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I once asked an
audience in Florida

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
if they have contacted
their higher self

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and how did they know its voice.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.720 align:middle line:84%
A woman answered
by saying that when

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
she's in crisis or
uncertain about what

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
to do next in her life and
she asks her higher self,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
it always asks
the same question.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you weren't afraid?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.410 align:middle line:84%
There is the answer,
plain and simple.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:19.380 align:middle line:84%
We open a link to
our higher self

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:84%
by overcoming fear
and doing what we

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.245 align:middle line:90%
would do if we were not afraid.

00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:84%
"If you want to know your
higher self, look at the people

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
you've met in the last
year," said Rudolf Steiner.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Do the people in your
life bring more fear

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:90%
or love into your life?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
"What you are looking
for is what is looking,"

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.920 align:middle line:90%
said Francis of Assisi.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
old Cherokee myth

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
where a Cherokee Indian
told his grandson, my son,

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a battle between
two wolves inside us all.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:90%
One is evil.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It's anger, jealousy, greed,
resentment, inferiority, lies,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:90%
and ego.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.240 align:middle line:90%
The other is good.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:84%
It's joy, peace, love, hope,
humility, kindness, empathy,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:90%
and truth.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.900 align:middle line:84%
The grandson thought about it
and then asked his grandfather,

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:90%
which wolf wins?

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And the old Cherokee simply
replied, the one you feed.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is fed when
we serve others.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally
or perhaps not,

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:84%
the acts of the good wolf
in the Cherokee story

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.000 align:middle line:84%
are exactly the same as the
fruit of the holy spirit, love,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.810 align:middle line:84%
joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness,

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
gentleness, and self-control.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Doing these works
seems a certain way

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to get the higher
self's attention.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:84%
9:00-- as Thomas
continues his journey,

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:37.500 align:middle line:84%
he leaves Earth and
reaches the great haven

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:84%
of the merchants that sit
on the shore of the sea.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The merchants are
interpreted as pure souls

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and the sea is the great ocean
of consciousness and also

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:90%
the Milky Way.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
At this point, Thomas
is almost home.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:84%
His inner journey
to self-realization

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:84%
has taken him to the place
where once again, he will

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:90%
put on his beaming garment.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:84%
10:00-- "I saw it, a bright
rope sent by my parents

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:90%
making itself ready.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.610 align:middle line:84%
I heard the sound of
its tones," he says,

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
"and I perceived also in myself
that my stature was growing

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:90%
according to its labors.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It was spreading
itself out before me.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It hastened that
I might take it on

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and I stretched forth
and received it.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
With the beauty of its
colors, I adorned myself

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:90%
in my toga of brilliant colors.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I cast around me in
its whole breadth.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I clothed myself there
with an ascendant

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to the majesty of my father,
who had sent it to me.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was with
him in his kingdom

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and he promised to me that at
the gate of the king of kings,

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I should speed with them and
bringing my gift and my pearl,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I should appear with
him before our king."

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Thomas has achieved his new
life, his new light body.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
The hero has been transformed
by the quest on Earth

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and returned with
the elixir of life.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.780 align:middle line:90%
His soul has been upgraded.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Our hero has ascended and
now it's time to celebrate.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
11:00-- everything
suddenly makes

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.230 align:middle line:84%
sense for Thomas, the reason
for the journey, all the ups

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and downs, the forgetting,
the trials and tribulations.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:84%
12:00-- Thomas begins
life in the new,

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:90%
upgraded ordinary world.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the happy ending.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But chances are for Thomas, just
like us, we won't stay there.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:26.450 align:middle line:84%
For soon, the call
will come and it will

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:90%
be time to travel once again.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We have come a long way on our
journey in "The Awakened Soul."

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Our work together
in these 13 episodes

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:84%
has been about tapping
into the power of the soul,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.680 align:middle line:84%
mostly through the use
of stories and images.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
In the first
episode, I mentioned

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that I'm most astounded
by the power of the soul

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and the power of images
to activate the soul.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a profound
spiritual practice.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Like the Egyptians and Gnostics,
Buddhist ascension teachings

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
say that paintings can become
portals to the afterlife realm.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
We discussed the welcoming
descent paintings,

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.290 align:middle line:84%
like this one, which were
indispensable religious

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
furnishings at
the time of death.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Such paintings depict
the scene in which

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
the Amida Buddha
and his attendants

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
descend from heaven on clouds
to take a believing soul back

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.239 align:middle line:84%
to the western paradise or
pure land on a lotus throne.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The scrolls were often hung
by the bedside of the dying

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to ensure the prospect
of rebirth in paradise.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, silken cords were
attached to the Buddha's hand,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.109 align:middle line:84%
offering the dying physical
assistance during the journey

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to paradise.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Apart from exemplifying
the Buddhist belief

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.239 align:middle line:84%
that paintings can become
portals to the afterlife realm,

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
this practice also tells us
that maybe even silken cords

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.739 align:middle line:84%
are a very powerful symbol of
the connection, the conduit,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.310 align:middle line:84%
between the world of matter
and the world of the soul.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:59.580 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is
awe-inspiring and I

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.865 align:middle line:84%
will leave you now to
ponder Christianity's answer

00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to these paintings, which
is equally awe-inspiring.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:84%
This answer is found in
the ascension of Mary.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The scene celebrates
the Christian belief

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:84%
that after Mary's
death, her body

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
was raised from
her tomb to heaven

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:84%
by Jesus, who is shown emerging
from a blue sphere or stargate.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:84%
According to Orthodox
Christian tradition,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the Virgin Mary died in the
presence of all the apostles

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
except Thomas,
who is the subject

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.760 align:middle line:84%
of "The Hymn of the Pearl"
or "The Song of the Pearl."

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:84%
At the time of Mary's
ascension, Thomas was in India.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And the story says he
returned to Jerusalem

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:43.370 align:middle line:84%
by traveling in the sky--
by a stargate, perhaps?

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But Thomas was late in
arriving and missed seeing

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Mary ascending with the angels.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:53.240 align:middle line:84%
In the story, Thomas
was doubtful in nature.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.770 align:middle line:84%
In order to convince
others, he requested

00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Mary to give him a sign
or proof of her ascension.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Just then, her throne
chariot, her blue sphere,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.390 align:middle line:84%
stopped in the air
and Mary gifted

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
her girdle, symbolized by
a silken string, to Thomas.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.755 align:middle line:84%
Then he showed the string
to other disciples of Jesus

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:90%
and convinced them.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And he took this string
on his own journey.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are in
your own soul journey,

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I hope this presentation
has provided

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:84%
a lifeline or a connection,
a conduit for you

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.534 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
take it with you.

00:36:29.534 --> 00:36:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Know this.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Your soul awakening is the
greatest journey anyone

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
can undertake on Earth
and the work you are doing

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:41.060 align:middle line:84%
will benefit all who step
on this path behind you.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Until we meet again, be
humble and shine brightly.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.
