00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello,
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I recently came across an
article that speaks directly

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to my work on
ascension, stargates,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and human transformation
into angels,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
or celestial, or star beings.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I will share excerpts
of it with you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
today in a commentary
in this episode.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:84%
The article is
entitled "When Going

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
on a Heavenly Journey, Travel
Light and Dress Appropriately."

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's by Dr. Carla
Sulzbach, a professor

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.894 align:middle line:84%
of Religious Studies at
McGill University in Toronto.

00:00:46.894 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It was published in the
"Journal for the Study

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of the Pseudepigrapha" in 2010.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sulzbach notes that Jewish
teachings about encountering

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
heavenly beings
instructs the reader

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
not to speculate under any
circumstance concerning

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
four things-- about
what is above,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
what is below, what was
before, and what will be after.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
She notes that despite this
directive, myriads of tomes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:84%
have been filled with exactly
that-- speculation concerning

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:84%
what is beyond human
reach and perception,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.590 align:middle line:84%
including manuals on ascension
and how to reach places

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond space and time.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:90%
This is our area of interest.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about ascension

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in realizing that these ancient
mystics were breaking down

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
boundaries and
mapping the afterlife

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos of the soul.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew Bible, she notes,
presents quite a number

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:84%
of examples that deal with
speculation concerning

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
various aspects of
the heavenly realm.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
However, it's the Second Temple
period, the second temple

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon, that is, and
late antiquity, encompassing

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
especially the time of Jesus
that a virtual explosion

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and the production of these
ascension materials took place.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
We suddenly begin
hearing stories

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
of humans ascending--
lots of them.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And other scholars have
documented this explosion

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
of ascension materials, and I've
spent the past five years or so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
scaling the ivory
towers of academia

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve these texts
and to bring them back

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
into the popular area,
where people who need them,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
such as you, can
actually access them.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:84%
What shocks me the most about
the academic discussions is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
how explicitly they
describe higher dimensional

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
worlds and celestial
beings, as well as

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
human transformation
into celestial beings

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and ascension via stargates.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, the
academics don't actually

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:90%
use the term "stargate."

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
They dance all around it,
saying portal or vortex.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But in my view, if they actually
use the word "stargate,"

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
it would bring tremendous
clarity to these texts.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Numerous spiritual and
religious traditions

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
tell us that in
order for the soul

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
to enter the stargate to
the next higher realm--

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
call it heaven, the
pure land, or nirvana--

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
the soul must be
dressed appropriately.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in order to enter
this higher frequency realm,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
we must learn to dress lightly.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:84%
This is why ascended beings,
like the Egyptian god Osiris,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:90%
are shown dressed in white.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The whiteness stands for the
purity of the soul and a higher

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:90%
vibrational existence.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Dressing or coding ourselves
in our light body robe

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is actually a key code
symbol for the soul

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
that crosses spiritual
and mystical traditions.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:84%
A key point is that this
robe is transmittable.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
This robe actually
symbolizes the vibration

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of the beings in the
next higher dimension.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.596 align:middle line:84%
But it is also a state of being
that is acquired in this realm.

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We might even go
so far as to say

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.140 align:middle line:84%
it is the purpose of
our earthly existence.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The angels live in a higher
realm, where anything

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and everything is possible.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
They know the lost
science of the soul.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But some of them crossed a
previously forbidden boundary

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and took on human form to teach
humans the secret of heaven,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
that is, how to
cross this boundary

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and return the
soul to its source.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
The texts that I'm referring
to include the Enoch books,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.435 align:middle line:84%
many Essene works like the
Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran

00:04:40.435 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and Bubastis in Egypt, and
the Merkabah, or mystic throne

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
literature, and also
the Book of Revelation.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
The angels that are
featured in these texts

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to manifest on
Earth in many forms, especially

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
as seraph, hybrid
human angels who

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
are described as luminous
plasma-like an emitting rainbow

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
colors.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Their bodies are
portrayed as fiery red

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
because they burn with
the love of the creator.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Their vortex, or
toroidal-shaped bodies,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
symbolize the
luminous energy field

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
of heaven-- the energy
field of the awakened soul.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.970 align:middle line:84%
In fact, during
the Renaissance, it

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
was proclaimed that the
highest human aspiration

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
was to transform into a seraph.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
This was based on Francis
of Assisi's encounter

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:90%
with Jesus as a seraph.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Angels often appear
in human guise

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
when they need to communicate
directly with humans.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
They also have the ability
to shape shift, or appear

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
as pure flame and
then subsequently take

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
on human appearance.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
This could be because
the human form is in fact

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:90%
the natural shape of the soul.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The bodies of the
angels are covered

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
with a luminous garment,
the robe of the soul.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve in Jewish
mysticism were originally

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
dressed in this
luminous clothing,

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
but when they were evicted from
Eden, these clothes of light

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
were taken away
and all of humanity

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:90%
were given coats of skin.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has sought to recover
the secrets of the light body

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
ever since.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And in Christian teaching,
Jesus was the second Adam,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
sent to correct the
mistake of Adam and Eve

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
by showing us how to
reacquire our robe of light.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Jesus himself acquired
this cloak or robe of light

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.184 align:middle line:90%
after his baptism.

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The angels in white
at the Resurrection

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.370 align:middle line:84%
wore this garment,
as in fact did

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Jesus in his own Resurrection.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The bright white
linen dress worn

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
by members of the priestly
classes as well as the Essenes,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
as related by
Philo and Josephus,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is clearly related
to matters of purity

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and also, in imitation of
the luminosity of the angels.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The robe of the soul
as we now explore,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
actually has five layers.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Five is an extremely
important symbol.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
In mystical symbolism, five is
the number of the perfect man.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Five is also found
in the human body--

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the five fingers of the hand,
the five senses, the five

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.700 align:middle line:84%
members, two arms,
two legs, and a head.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
According to Giordano
Bruno, the number five

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:90%
is the number of the soul.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:10%
In the teaching of the
followers of Plato,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:10%
called Neoplatonism, for turning
humans into divine beings,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:10%
five steps are followed.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.000 align:middle line:10%
First, the soul recognizes
it has a Divine Self,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:10%
called the "daimon."

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:10%
Next, the soul has a pure
vision of the divine.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:10%
Third, the lower self and
the higher self unite.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:10%
Fourth, the combined
souls experience

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:10%
a spiritual ascension.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:10%
Until fifth, the
soul is deified.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.015 align:middle line:84%
This divine work
is called theurgy

00:08:18.015 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's the use of ritual,
both physical and mental,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
to purify and elevate the soul.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It is also called the
Apotheosis, or divination

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, or the perfection
of the soul and our elevation

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
to the race of just humans
made perfect as described

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:90%
in the book of Hebrews.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We attain our divination,
our divine body,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
when the soul harmonizes
with the divine order

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and affects a communion and
divine union with the gods,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately, with the one.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Mystically speaking, we are
the one and the one is you.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.355 align:middle line:84%
But through the five
steps, or theurgy,

00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
we self-perfect and transform
into a god or an angel.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And we put on the five-fold
robe of the angels.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
This key code symbol,
the five steps

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and five layers of
the soul, is actually

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
established at the
beginning of life.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our bodies are made
from materials from supernovas.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
In its death throes,
a star or supernova

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:84%
resembles an enormous,
many-colored onion,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:46.010 align:middle line:84%
as successively heavier layers
of fuel ignite and burn.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:10%
The human egg, the female
reproductive element,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:10%
follows a similar pathway.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:10%
It is larger than any
other bodily cells,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:10%
and it's made up of
a nucleus surrounded

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:10%
by five layers-- cytoplasm,
plasma membrane, chorion,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:10%
albumin layers, and
the shell membrane.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
These five codes are
added successively

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:84%
as the egg passes
down the oviduct.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The egg is initially
formed by materials

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that have migrated into
the special environment

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
of the ovaries, and only in
this special environment,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
those primordial germ
cells become eggs.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:84%
The egg itself
contains within itself

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
all the essentials
for development,

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
leaving the sperm the
role of activating

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%
an already prepared system.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:10%
The coats of the egg are
distinctive in humans

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:10%
and a close relation exists
between the cellular features

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:10%
of the egg and the life history
of the species to which it

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:10%
belongs.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it fascinating how
the five layers of the egg

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the five steps to
our transformation into angels?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
You may have heard of the
Principle of Correspondence--

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
as above, so below,
as within, so without.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We find this in the
protoplasmic framework

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
of the egg that sets
the structural framework

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of the new individual, just as
the framework of the supernova

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
set the structural
framework for the egg.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And using this
method of analogy,

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:84%
or correspondence, this
is a really potent axiom

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
when applied to the
process of cosmic birth

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and our own evolution
as cosmic eggs.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When we turn to Egypt,
we find that there are

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:90%
five components to the soul.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The five components are
Ren, Ka, Ib, Ba, and Akh.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The simplest of
these concepts is

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Ren, which is literally your
name given to you at birth.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It lives for as long
as you are remembered

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
or can be read about
in inscriptions

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:84%
or included in prayers
for the ancestors

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and their achievements.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
The second layer is the Ka.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's that vital essence,
that vital spark

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
or vital fire that makes the
difference between the living

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and the dead.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
The living and the dead
meet between a warm body

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and the cold clay,
or unactivated DNA.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
The third component
is called the Ba,

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
which is always portrayed
as a human-headed bird.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful golden Ba amulet
from the Ptolemaic period

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:84%
would have been worn
as a good luck device

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and a reminder of the soul.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The Ba is your personality,
or that which makes each of us

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
unique and different, that which
makes us strive and achieve.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
The Ib component of the
soul is literally the heart.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It's formed from a single drop
of clotted blood extracted

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
from your mother's heart at
the hour of your conception

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:90%
or birth.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Now by heart, the
Egyptians meant not just

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.830 align:middle line:84%
the organ for pumping
blood around your body,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
but the metaphysical
seat of your soul,

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that good or godly
directing force in your life

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
that's searching after
truth, peace, and harmony.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
At the final reckoning,
the day of judgment

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of the
Dead, the heart

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
took center stage,
being asked to account

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:90%
for all a person's deeds.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
It was weighed against the
feather of divine truth.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And if the heart weighed
less than the feather,

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:10%
the soul continued on
its spiral of evolution,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:10%
joining Osiris and the
other celestial beings

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:10%
in the next level of evolution.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
If not, there was a
recycling program,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.364 align:middle line:84%
and we got to do
it all over again.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Finally, there is
the Akh, which is

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
the blessed or
transfigured soul,

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:90%
according to the Egyptians.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the soul that
had been judged by Osiris

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.886 align:middle line:90%
and had been found justified.

00:14:05.886 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
The Akh, another
spiritual entity

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
which was the
transfigured spirit that

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:15.420 align:middle line:84%
survived death and actually
gets to mingle with the gods.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
We're actually looking at the
transfigured or re-erected King

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Tut in this image here, who's
portrayed in his crossed body,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:90%
his eternal light body.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Now turning from Egypt
into the Hindu teaching,

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
we find that, once again,
there are five material sheaths

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:84%
called kosha that envelop the
soul like concentric rings

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.095 align:middle line:90%
of an onion.

00:14:43.095 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing a
pattern develop here?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Each succeeding kosha
affects or controls

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:10%
the activity of the
preceding kosha.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And in this teaching
that's presented best

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:84%
by Swami Bharati,
we humans are viewed

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
as a lamp that has five
lampshades over our light.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And each of these lampshades is
a different color and density.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.410 align:middle line:84%
As the light shines through
these lampshades that

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:84%
cover our soul, it is
progressively changed

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:90%
in color and nature.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The yoga path of
self-realisation

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is one of progressively
moving inward through each

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
of these lampshades
or veils so as

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to experience the purity
at the eternal center

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
while at the same time

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
allowing that purity to animate
through our individuality.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at those koshas

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
now, beginning
with the Annamaya.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%
Anna means food.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So the food sheath, or kosha,
is the gross, physical body.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It includes our five organs
of perception-- including

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
sight, hearing, smell, taste,
and touch-- and the five

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
organs of action-- prehension,
locomotion, articulation,

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:90%
excretion, and procreation.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:10%
It's called food sheath
because food or anna enabled

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:10%
it to come into being, and
it's maintained by food,

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:10%
and it ultimately ends up
as food or the constituents

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:10%
of food-- the worm food idea.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:10%
The next kosha, the energy
kosha, is Pranamaya.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Prana means energy.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
It is the vital force that
produces the subtle vibrations

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
related to breath and
which are the driving

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.460 align:middle line:84%
force behind the physical
aspect of the senses

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and the operation of the
physical body itself.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It allows the
invisible indweller,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of our true self,
our soul, to be

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
able to animate in
the external world.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:84%
The third sheath is the mental
sheath, the Manamaya kosha.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Mana means mind.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is the level
of processing thoughts

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:84%
This layer is
composed with Mind,

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of
thoughts, emotions, and desires.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It is also constituted
with the five sense organs,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
like the tongue, smell,
eyes, ear, and skin, which

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:90%
makes every individual unique.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the layer that receives
inputs of all the sense organs

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and interprets the
good or bad in it.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very much more
powerful than the Anamaya

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
kosha or the
Pranamaya one, and is

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:90%
governed by the other koshas.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's really the center
of our human existence.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Many types of treatments
that you use like music,

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:84%
placebo, aromatherapy,
actually work on this layer.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The fourth kosha or layer
is the wisdom kosha.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Vijnana means knowing.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
It is the sheath of wisdom that
is underneath the processing

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or thinking aspect of mind.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
mind behind the curtain,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It knows, it decides, it
judges, and it discriminates

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
between this and that, between
what's useful and not useful.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And then finally we come to the
bliss chakra, Anandamaya kosha,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
which is the most interior
of the koshas, the first

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of the koshas surrounding
the Atman, the eternal center

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Ananda means bliss.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
However, it's not a bliss as
a mere emotion of happiness

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that's experienced at the
level of the mind sheath.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole different
order of ecstasy

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
from that of the mind.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a cosmic peace
and joy and love

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that is underneath,
beyond the mind, that's

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.920 align:middle line:84%
independent of any
reason or stimulus

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to cause a happy
mental reaction.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply being and
resting in bliss called Ananda.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate goal
of all human life

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
is to move from the Anamaya
kosha, the most outermost

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
kosha, and into the
innermost, and gradually then

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
move into the Anandamaya kosha,
a state of blissful being

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
in which we are merging with
the infinite, with the cosmic,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing our
oneness with all that is.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So from our exploration
into the Hindu

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and the Egyptian
tradition, we now

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
realize that our soul body
has five unseen layers.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.430 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the concept that
is at the root of da Vinci's

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
"Vitruvian Man."

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
This concept is also
encoded in the story

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
of the crucifixion of Jesus.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Medieval Christians believed
that the pentagram symbolized

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:90%
the five wounds of Christ.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
At the crucifixion of
Jesus, Roman soldiers

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
took his outer garments
and made four parts,

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
a part to every soldier
and also the tunic.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The Bible says that
this final tunic was

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.245 align:middle line:90%
seamless, woven in one piece.

00:20:07.245 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about
here in the crucifixion

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
is a total of five garments.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be by coincidence.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's what the Bible says.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So they have said to one
another, let us not tear it,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.263 align:middle line:84%
but cast lots for it to
decide whose it shall be.

00:20:24.263 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
This is Roman soldiers gambling
for the koshas of Christ.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:84%
This was to fulfill
the scripture that

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
says they divided my
outer garments among them

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and for my clothing
they cast lots.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The fifth garment, this
seamless robe or coat,

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.985 align:middle line:84%
is actually the symbol for
the light body or resurrection

00:20:44.985 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:90%
body of Christ.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So again, is it
merely coincidence

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that these Roman soldiers
divided Jesus' clothes

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
into five garments?

00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Or is this actually a
reference to a correspondence

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:10%
to the Hindu and Egyptian
tradition for the awakened soul

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:10%
and the five koshas, or
five layers, of our soul?

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Taking this one step forward,
a giant leap forward,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow colors that
surround the cosmic Christ's

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:84%
resurrection body also
correspond to the five colors

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan rainbow
body of light tradition

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:84%
in which the human
body is dissolved

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:90%
into five pure essences.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans teach that the
Great Perfection's rainbow body

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
is the product of the human body
be dissolved into pure light.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually constituted
by the five pure lights.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
They are associated with
the five-color Himalayan

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
rainbow, which is white,
yellow, red, green, and blue.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:10%
The five pure lights are
understood as pure light energy

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:10%
and are considered to be
the most sublime essence

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:10%
quality of the five classical
elements-- namely, space, air,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:10%
water, fire, and earth.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.998 align:middle line:10%
These are the elements that
compose our many-colored dream

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.630 align:middle line:10%
coat.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And when all the colors are
mixed, they become white.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the original bright
white light body of the angels.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:90%
This is the robe of the soul.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Now the agnostic
gospel of Philip

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:90%
is very enlightening about this.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that the
Lord rose from the dead.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.312 align:middle line:84%
He became as he was, but
now his body was perfect.

00:22:41.312 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Well that sounds like the Great
Perfection of the Tibetans.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Philip goes on to say that
he, the cosmic Christ,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:84%
possessed flesh, but
this was true flesh.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Our flesh isn't
true, says Philip.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Ours is only an
image of the truth.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Then Philip goes
on to say that we

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
must become perfect
before leaving this world.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
This is explicitly
echoing the Tibetan idea

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:84%
that in order to leave Earth, we
must attain our perfect rainbow

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:20.180 align:middle line:84%
body of light and dress our
soul in its perfect-like body.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.706 align:middle line:84%
This is a very clear
reference to the attainment

00:23:23.706 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:90%
of the robe of the soul.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So what are we to
do with all this?

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we incorporate
this into our life?

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one
thing, it prompts us

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
sacredness of our soul

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and the immense power enfolded
within our human body.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It tells us about
the power of our soul

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to put on a five-fold
robe of light.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:90%
So why do we want to do that?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, in closing,
I want to share

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
some insights about this shining
coat from Yaqui sorcerer Don

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Juan, as documented by
Carlos Castaneda in his book

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:90%
"The Active Side of Infinity."

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the gnostics
and the apostle Paul,

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan taught that there
is an alien predator that

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
thinks of and treats
humans as property, slaves.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan believed that they use
or used humans as a food source

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and can overlay the
human psych in order

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to keep us dumbed down and
unaware of their influence.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
However, he teaches, it's
possible to dislodge them

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
through discipline
by allowing ourselves

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to be immersed in destructive
emotions-- fear, anxiety,

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
anger, strife, jealousy,
competitiveness--

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the dog-eat-dog mentality
we hold at minimum, what

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan calls our
shining coat of awareness

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and thus serve the alien agenda.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
This shining coat
is, in my opinion,

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:84%
the robe of the soul, or
the rainbow light body.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And Don Juan says that we
can rebuild our shining coat

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
and no longer be under the
influence of those dark forces

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
by removing the self from
our focus of existence--

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
get out of our ego,
in other words.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:84%
This is Essene Gnosticism
and Jewish mysticism as pure

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
as it gets.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And it gets to the
heart of our work

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
together on the
rainbow body of light

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and illuminating and
awakening our soul.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
Perfect Garment

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:84%
by the gnostics who
claimed that a group

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial beings
called archons would not

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:84%
be able to see us once we put
on our light body garments.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
As the Gospel of Philip
says, the powers, archons,

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
do you not see those who are
clothed in this perfect light,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and consequently are
not able to detain them.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:84%
One will clothe himself in
this light sacramentally

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:90%
in the union.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The gospel of Philip
continues saying,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
not only will the archives
be unable to detain

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
the perfect man, but they
will not be able to see him,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
for if they see him,
they will detain him.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There is no other
way, says Philip,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
for a person to
acquire this quality

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
except by putting
on the perfect light

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and he too becoming
perfect light.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
In my view, this perfect light
is a beautiful description

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan Great
Perfection and the attainment

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow light body.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan taught that
spiritual discipline

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
makes our glowing code
of awareness unpalatable

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:90%
to the predators.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:10%
The result is that the
predators become bewildered,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:10%
and inedible glowing
coat of awareness

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.790 align:middle line:10%
is not part of their
cognition, he said.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:10%
And after being
bewildered by us,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:10%
they don't have any recourse
other than refraining

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:10%
from continuing
their nefarious task.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan continued saying
that if the predators don't

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:84%
eat our glowing coat of
awareness for a while,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:90%
it will keep on growing.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And simplifying this matter
to the extreme, he says,

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I can say that sorcerers, by
means of their discipline,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and then getting out
of the ego again,

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:84%
push the predators
away long enough

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to allow their glowing
coat of awareness

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to grow beyond the
level of the toes.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And once it grows beyond
the level of the toes,

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
it grows back to
its natural size.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So here's my message,
derived from Don Juan, that

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is that if manifesting the
full rainbow light body

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
seems intimidating, Don Juan
is offering us encouragement.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
To protect ourselves
from the predator,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
we may only need to raise it to
the level just beyond the toes.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Philip, again-- but
when it is revealed,

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:84%
then the perfect light
will flow out on everyone.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And all those who are in it will
receive the chrism, the oil.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the slaves will be free
and the captives ransomed.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine a
world in which everyone

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
wears their rainbow of the
soul, or their robe of the soul?

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they lift it up
only to their toes.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Meditate on that.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Visualize that.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Actualize that.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, be
humble, let your light

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:90%
shine, and namaste.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:90%
This is William Henry.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.
