00:00:06.295 --> 00:00:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
It is considered

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the most mysterious relic
of all human history,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
but is it a relic, or
is it something else?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE HENRY:
Next on "Arcanum:"

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the
Shroud of Turin.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The Shroud of
Turin is a large, linen cloth

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:84%
imbued with the image of
a tortured, crucified man.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The question of
whether the Shroud of Turin

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
in is the actual burial cloth
of Jesus is open, unanswered.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Christian
belief says something

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of extraordinary significance
happened in a tomb

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:90%
just over 2000 years ago.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
This cloth was thought
to have been present.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: It is considered the
most important and most studied

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:90%
relic of Christianity.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: In year 2000,
Cardinal Ratzinger,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
later to be known as
Pope Benedict XVI,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
wrote that the Shroud of Turin
is a truly mysterious image,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
which no human artistry
was capable of producing.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
In some inexplicable way, it
appeared imprinted upon cloth

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and believed to show
the true face of Christ,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:90%
the crucified and risen Lord.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The shroud profoundly
challenges and confounds

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
human intellect.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Science has tried
to explain it, but

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
no universally accepted process
has being proposed to do so.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The image on the shroud defies
duplication by human hands.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM: In June,
2008, three years

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:10%
after he assumed the
papcy, Pope Benedict

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:10%
announced that the shroud
would be publicly displayed

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:10%
in the spring of
2010, and stated

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:10%
that he would like to go
to Turin to see it along

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:10%
with other pilgrims.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: During his visit
in Turin on Sunday, May

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
the second, 2010 Pope Benedict
described the Shroud of Turin

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
as an extraordinary icon--
the icon of holy Saturday,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
corresponding in every way
to what the Gospels tell us

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus-- an icon written
in blood, the blood of a man

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
who was scourged, crowned
with thorns, crucified,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and whose right
side was pierced.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The pope said also
that in the Turin shroud,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
we see as in a
mirror our suffering

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:90%
in the suffering of Christ.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Three years later,
on the 30th of March,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
2013 as part of the
Easter celebrations,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
there was an
extraordinary exposition

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud in the
Cathedral of Turin.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM: In a
carefully worded message,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:10%
Pope Francis asked and answered
a rhetorical question--

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:10%
how is it that the
faithful, like you, pause

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:10%
before this icon of a man
scourged and crucified?

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It is because the
man of the shroud

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
invites us to contemplate
Jesus of Nazareth.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Pope Francis
recorded a video message

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:84%
for the occasion, in
which he described

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
the image on the shroud
as this icon of a man,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and stated the man
of the shroud invites

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.099 align:middle line:84%
us to contemplate
Jesus of Nazareth.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: He continued
saying, "So looking

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
upon the man of the shroud, I
make Saint Francis of Assisi's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
prayer before the
crucifix my own.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Most high and glorious
God, enlighten the darkness

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
of my heart, and grant me
true faith, certain hope,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
and perfect charity,
sense, and understanding,

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Lord, so that I may carry out
your holy and true command."

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Pope Francis and his
predecessor Pope Benedict XVI

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:84%
have both described the
Shroud of Turin as an icon.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
In choosing this carefully
worded description,

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:84%
we realize the
popes are telling us

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
something astounding
about the shroud.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The Shroud
of Turin is not a relic.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an icon, and there's
a huge difference.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the shroud
may be the first icon.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
In our episode on
the transfiguration,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:90%
we decoded this term.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: In William's
feature investigation,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
he will help us gaze beyond the
surface of the Shroud of Turin,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.625 align:middle line:90%
the first icon.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: For millions of
Christians, the Shroud of Turin

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol for the hope for the
afterlife and life after death.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But could it be more
than just a symbol?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Could it be an actual tool
that assists believers

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in their journey
to resurrection?

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Is this why, in his carefully
worded message about the Shroud

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:84%
of Turin, Pope Francis
asked and answered

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that kind of odd
rhetorical question,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
how is it that the
faithful, like you, pause

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
before this icon of a man
scourged and crucified?

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it because the
man of the shroud

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
invites us to contemplate
Jesus of Nazareth?

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, an
icon is a sacred image

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that is believed to be
charged with spiritual power.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They also believe it can
transmit this spiritual power.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, an
icon is a living image

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
that functions as a
portal or a gateway.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:84%
It's literally considered to be
a two-way mirror, and a method

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.580 align:middle line:84%
of communication with
the divine realms.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Icons were specially created
to enable a visceral encounter

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
with a holy being, or to make
present a spiritual energy.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:84%
They are a form
of visual alchemy

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that can help us in our
own transfiguration,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%
if that's our path.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They were specially created to
enable this visceral encounter

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
with a holy being, or to
make that spiritual energy

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
present in our bodies.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Thus, they are
this visual alchemy

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:10%
that can assist us in
our transformation.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The amazing account
of the transformation,

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:84%
or transfiguration of Jesus
from the book of Matthew

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
says that after six days, Jesus
took with him Peter, James,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and John the brother of
James, and led them up

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.430 align:middle line:90%
a high mountain by themselves.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
There, he was
transfigured before them.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' face shone like
the Sun, and his clothes

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:90%
became as white as light.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Just then, there appeared
before them Moses and Elijah,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:90%
talking with Jesus.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
For the icon makers of
the transfiguration icons,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
these images became a
channel between two worlds.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:10%
To an orthodox Christian, the
images are more than that.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:10%
They are a medium through which
the whole may be approached,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and grace channeled,
like a two-way mirror.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
In the magical alchemical
imagination of the icon makers,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
these images were designed to be
actual doors to another world.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Our world and the spiritual
world are open to each other

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:90%
through the icon.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's so important

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to make the distinction
in the Pope's

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
terminology between the
shroud being a relic

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and the shroud being an icon.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The icon makers held that
through prayer and meditation,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
believers could actually come
to perceive the same divine

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
light that shone around Jesus
during his transfiguration.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Through contemplation,
meditation, and reflection

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
on the icon, we begin to
reflect the light experienced

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
by Jesus in our lives.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
By mirroring Christ, the
transfiguration icon makers

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
proposed, we can put on
our own cloak of light,

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
our garment of light, our robe
of light, or shining garment,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:90%
as the light body is called.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
In addition to calling
the Shroud of Turin

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
an icon-- again, not
a relic-- Pope Francis

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
said that in the shroud,
we see as in a mirror

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
our suffering in the
suffering of Christ.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Francis is clearly
speaking the language

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of the icon makers,
the language of those

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
who know the secrets
of this visual alchemy.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's one step
away from telling us

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually use the
Shroud of Turin as a mirror

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to assist us in
our own transfiguration.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
This is more than
poetic language.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The Pope, Francis,
is telling us,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in my view, that the shroud
is in fact a two-way mirror

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and a method of communication
with the divine realm,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
specifically with
the light of Christ.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So is this icon literally,
literally a portal or conduit

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.110 align:middle line:90%
to another world?

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus leave this as
a message of healing?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Did he leave this icon as
a way to connect with him,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to open a portal to
the divine realm?

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Is the material world
and the spiritual world

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
open to each other through the
Christ icon or the shroud icon?

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Just how far can
we stretch this?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.595 align:middle line:84%
In his book "The Sign,"
British art historian Thomas de

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Wesselow has proposed a theory
that the shroud contains

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.830 align:middle line:84%
the living light of
Christ, literally.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:84%
He says that this
light was captured

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:90%
by the material of the shroud.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he cites
a Chinese ceremony

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
which involved enticing
into a sick man's coat

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.270 align:middle line:84%
the departing spirit, which
has already left his body.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Wesselow proposes that when Mary
Magdalene saw the resurrected

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus on Easter morning,
that what she actually saw

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:84%
was the Shroud of Turin with the
man of light imprinted upon it.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Analogously, the
shroud could have

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
been seen as a coat,
de Wesselow notes,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
in which Jesus' spirit
has been caught.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very interesting,
because this view is in harmony

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
with the view expressed in
several episodes of "Arcanum."

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
That is, the ancient
purveyors of arcanum

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
utilized the symbol
of a robe or coat

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
as a metaphor for the craft
of human transformation

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:90%
into light.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:10%
In our episode on
ascension thrones,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:10%
we noted that Elias, the
messiah's forerunner,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:10%
is a man to whom many great
mysteries are attached,

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:10%
especially those concerning
a transmittable cloak, coat,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:10%
or garment.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:10%
According to the Book of
Kings, he raised the dead,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:10%
brought fire down
from the sky, and was

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:10%
taken up in a whirlwind,
either accompanied

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:10%
by a chariot of horses of flame,
or riding in this chariot.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is clear that Elijah
knew the secret of arcanum.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Elijah possessed
ancient keys that

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
allowed him to be
transported from one location

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to another, to raise the
dead, to command rain,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and even to baffle
world leaders.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, as Elijah ascended
in his Merkaba whirlwind,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:84%
he did so in a form other than
as a flesh and blood human.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
He appears to have
adopted a body that

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
could bend space
and time, and also

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to dematerialize
and rematerialize

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
at another location
or frequency.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
This teaching is also found
in the Tibetan rainbow body

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
This special ability
is transmittable

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and is symbolized by Elijah's
pala garment, or power garment,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
which he transmitted
to his priest Elisha

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:90%
as he rose into the heavens.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.540 align:middle line:84%
In Christian tradition,
Elijah reincarnated

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:90%
as John the Baptist.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:10%
And as shown in this mosaic in
San Marco in Florence, Italy,

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:10%
Elijah reacquired
this power cloak,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:10%
and then transmitted it to his
cousin Jesus at the baptism.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:10%


00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:10%
In this 12th century image
from Winchester, England,

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:10%
an angel stands beside Jesus
to give him this power cloak,

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:10%
and by extension, its abilities.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:10%
Jesus then demonstrated his
knowledge of this power garment

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:10%
or cloak at the transfiguration,
during which his body shone

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:10%
like the Sun.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Jesus' ultimate
expression of this arcanum

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:10%
was demonstrated at his
resurrection, in which Jesus

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:10%
turned to light, and then
manifested to his disciples

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:10%
as an extraordinary light being.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Matthias Grunewald has
captured this moment

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
in a powerful and
triumphant way.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Andrea Mantegna's illumination
of Jesus' transformation

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:90%
into light is equally stunning.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:84%
He shows Jesus in
a radiant fire,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%
enfolded by luminous angels.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Jesus gives the blessing signal.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Millions believe
the Shroud of Turin

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
is a record of
Jesus' resurrection.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
But what if, as the popes
proclaim, it is an icon?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And what if, as an icon, it
is capable of transmitting

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of resurrection,
just like Elijah transmitted

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:90%
the secrets to his priest?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:10%
It is astounding to think
that Secondo Pia's 1898

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:10%
negative of this image is
a view of the Shroud made

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.400 align:middle line:10%
possible only by the
invention of photography

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:10%
in the late 19th century.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:10%
The image appears
far more coherent

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:10%
than it does when
seen in positive.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was by accident that
Secondo Pia unwittingly

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
revealed the face and body
on the Shroud of Turin.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
No one knew yet
that the clearer,

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
reverse image existed
on the Shroud,

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:84%
for the faint face image on
the Shroud cannot be clearly

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
observed, or even recognized,
with the naked eye.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Pia later said that he
almost dropped and broke

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
the photographic plate in the
darkroom from the shock of what

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
appeared on it.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.030 align:middle line:84%
The reverse plate showed the
image of a man and a face

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that could not be seen
with the naked eye.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:84%
To this day, the
enigma of the origin

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of the body image of
the Shroud of Turin

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is a challenge to
our intelligence

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:90%
and to our science.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Experts are in agreement that
the image on the linen shroud

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
is not made up of any physical
substance such as paint

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:90%
or pigment.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
This means it's
not a photograph.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It is, in fact, an
alteration of the surface

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
of the linen by some effect
of light or radiation,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:84%
something which also
makes linen turn yellow.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
The light energy was able to
image the body and surrounding

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
objects, including the
markings on the tops

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of the coins placed
on the eyes of Jesus.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
For this to occur,
the imaging light

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
must have surrounded
the body, suggesting

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the body was the
source of the light.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
It also means the
light was uniform.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Scientists from
Italy's National Agency

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for New Technologies, Energy
and Sustainable Economic

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
Development spent years trying
to replicate the shroud's

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:90%
markings.

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
These markings show a body
that endured extreme torture,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
followed by crucifixion.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
In December, 2011,
these scientists

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
announced that the
Turin shroud was created

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
by a flash of
supernatural light,

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and it couldn't be
a medieval forgery,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:90%
as many had come to believe.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:10%
They have concluded
only something

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:10%
akin to ultraviolet lasers,
far beyond the capability

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:10%
of medieval forgers,
could have created

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:10%
the image on the shroud.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:10%
This has led to
fresh suggestions

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:10%
that the imprint
was indeed created

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:10%
by a huge burst of
energy accompanying

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:10%
the resurrection of Christ.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Could a momentary burst of
radiant energy and E equals Mc

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
squared transfiguration
account for these properties?

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:10%
If the Shroud of
Turin was indeed

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:10%
created by the same
phenomenon that allowed Jesus

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:10%
to glow brighter than the Sun in
front of James, Peter, and John

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:10%
at the transfiguration, then
the extraordinary features

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:10%
that this cloth has
been found to possess

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:10%
could have a
clearer explanation.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:10%
The prophet Daniel
had prophesied

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:10%
about the risen dead
shining like the stars.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:10%
Did Jesus fulfill this prophecy
by transforming himself

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:10%
into a celestial or star being?

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:10%
Is the Shroud of
Turin calling us

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:10%
to follow Jesus in
this transformation,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:10%
and join him in the stars?

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:10%
As we have explored in
other episodes of "Arcanum,"

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:10%
I have established myself as
one of the leading researchers

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:10%
in the belief that the
resurrection of Jesus

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:10%
represented his demonstration
of what the Tibetans call

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.040 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow body of light.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Rainbow body practitioners
can dissolve the human body

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:10%
into a vortex of energy
that ultimately manifests

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:10%
as five-color rainbow light,
leaving behind only hair, toe-

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and fingernails that have
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:10%
This is the rainbow surrounding
Jesus in Christian resurrection

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:10%
art.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:10%
He has attained
the rainbow body.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:10%
And Tibetans actually
teach that icons

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:10%
can transmit the vibration
of the rainbow body.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the rainbow body
is taught via images.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So was it the particles
radiating from the rainbow body

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus that marked the
images on the shroud?

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Is the Shroud of Turin a
record of Jesus' attainment

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow body?

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it, once again,
an icon capable of

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:84%
transmitting the secrets or
vibration of the resurrection,

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
or rainbow body of light?

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it the ultimate icon?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And is that what these
visionary artists

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
have attempted to communicate
in their paintings

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
based on the shroud?

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If the Shroud of
Turin is an icon,

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
then it is by definition a
channel of spiritual energy.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It is by definition a
portal to another reality,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that Christ can
speak through an image or icon

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
is actually well-documented
in Christian history.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, de Wesselow cites
an extraordinary experience

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:84%
of Saint Francis of
Assisi, who is shown here

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:90%
radiating the holy light.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:84%
An image of Christ and the
crucifix at San Damiano

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
miraculously spoke
to Saint Francis,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Go repair my
church, which, as you see,

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:23.720 align:middle line:90%
is falling completely in ruin."

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Above Jesus' head is a
portrayal of the ascension.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:10%
We see Christ emerging
from a red circle,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:10%
holding a golden cross
which is now his scepter,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of arcanum.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
There are other
powerful examples

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of Christ speaking
or transmitting

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.340 align:middle line:90%
a work of art or an image.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Shown here is an image
of the Arma Christi,

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.387 align:middle line:84%
the instruments of the Passion,
from a 14th-century book

00:21:51.387 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
shelved in the Royal Collection
of the British Library.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:10%
It's divided into a series of
38 compartments, each of which

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:10%
depicts images of the
instruments of the Passion,

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:10%
or some other object or event
emblematic of the Passion--

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:10%
the hammer, the cock
that crew three times,

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:10%
the dice, the pelican, the wound
in Christ's side, and so forth.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.620 align:middle line:10%
The text declares that
whoever recites the prayer,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:10%
"Ave facies
praeclara," and looks

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:10%
at the image with devotion,
will receive an indulgence

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:10%
of three years, and may
experience a beatific vision

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:10%
of Christ, in which the glory
pours upon the meditator.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:10%
This image represents
this beatific vision.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
A giant face of the deity
is surrounded by flames,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in rays of gold, silver,
and orange, and white

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
against a blue background
bordered with clouds.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Angels are to be seen
through the rays.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And on the top left,
the angel holds up

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
the naked soul of
a mitered bishop.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The rays beam down into
the second and third zones.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the second, an abbott,
Saint Bernard, points down,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and Saint Paul holds
his hands raised.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:10%
In the third zone, a
man and woman kneel

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:10%
on either side of a sphere of
the universe, with the Earth

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:10%
at the center, and the fall
of man represented therein.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:10%
Then there's the experience
of Saint Theresa of Avila,

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:10%
who received the stigmata
marks, the wounds

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:10%
of the crucified Jesus, from an
image of Christ on the cross.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:10%
As seen in this
painting by Manetti,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:10%
Christ beams the stigmata
from this painting

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.530 align:middle line:10%
to Theresa via rays of light.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:84%
These accounts affirm
that it is indeed

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
possible for icons or images
to transmit the energies

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:84%
or vibrations of the
crucified Christ, and indeed

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:90%
the resurrected Christ.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:84%
If one views the Shroud
of Turin as an icon,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
as the popes are now doing,
that can link us to Christ,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and even can open a portal
or gateway to other realms,

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
then it certainly
would behoove one

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to get as close to
this icon as possible.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Claire will tell the story
of our personal encounter

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
with the Shroud of Turin in
her Beyond the Veil segment.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:10%
But before that, we
must pause to consider

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:24.590 align:middle line:10%
the question of how a human
body can turn to flame,

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:10%
or holy light, and momentarily
shine brighter than the Sun.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
A provocative answer is
provided by Dame Isabel Piczek,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
a Hungarian-born particle
physicist and internationally

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:90%
renowned monumental artist.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, Dame Piczek
became fascinated

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.960 align:middle line:84%
by a mysterious property of
the shroud that is impossible,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
yet actually is
evidenced by this cloth.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
That is, the muscles
of the body are not

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:58.790 align:middle line:84%
crunched against the
stone of the tomb.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:90%
They're perfect.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:84%
This means the body was
levitating, hovering,

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
or floating between the
two sides of the Shroud.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:84%
As Piczek says,
this means there's

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:90%
no gravity involved here.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:84%
In addition, Piczek
observed that the image

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:90%
is distortion free.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:84%
This is impossible if the
shroud was wrapped, draped,

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise placed on the body.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It is only possible if the
shroud was absolutely taut,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
stretched like a paint
canvas on a frame.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Piczek's work strongly suggests
that the image of Jesus

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:43.960 align:middle line:84%
was projected as a quantum
hologram on the cloth.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
She says the entire
resurrection process

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
is akin to the Big Bang creation
of the universe, when something

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:90%
was created from nothing.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
You can read the
science of the shroud,

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
such as the total lack of
gravity, lack of entropy

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:84%
without gravitational collapse,
no time, no space-- it conforms

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:90%
to no known law of physics.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And according to the nature of
the event horizon, says Piczek,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the dead body must
have left its image

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.600 align:middle line:84%
on the two surfaces
of the event horizons.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
At the time of the explosion
of the event horizons,

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
these images were ejected
onto both sides of the shroud,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
with the body hovering
parallel to the event horizons.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
This explains why the
image shows a dead man, not

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
the risen body.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It also explains why
the image is negative.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It went from a positive body
image to the negative image,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:90%
like a camera film negative.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:44.380 align:middle line:84%
This indicates how the
image got onto the cloth.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:10%
To Piczek, the shroud symbolizes
life, or victory over death.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:10%
It does not signify
the end of Jesus' life.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it is an
unbelievable beginning

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
of his new life because of the
depth of the collapsed event

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:90%
horizon.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
There is the
singularity, she says.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what physicist proposed
happened at the Big Bang.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And she says that
we have nothing

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:84%
less in the tomb of
Christ that the beginning

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
of a new universe.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.950 align:middle line:84%
In his article that lays out
his considered reflections

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:84%
on the question of how a man
can shine brighter than the Sun,

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Doctor Andrew Silverman
begins with the evidence

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that thought, light, and
matter are interrelated.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
It is further suggested that
the nature of this relation

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
implies that our
corporeal state is

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
a symptom of the
restriction of mind.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And inference, says
Silverman, derives

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:52.200 align:middle line:84%
from this that simply undoing
these restrictions has

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
the power to release the tension
of space, which we call matter,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
thereby transforming
it into light.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Silverman cites the argument
that Erwin Schrodinger

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.100 align:middle line:84%
made, one of the founders
of quantum theory.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:84%
He says that the eternal
nature of consciousness

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is the answer to the question.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
If Schrodinger was correct,
then all sentient beings

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:84%
must have been one in the
initial singularity which

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:90%
gave rise to the Big Bang.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
This all-together state of
sentience beyond time and space

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
precedes the state of
separation and limitation

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
that define a physical universe.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:84%
In my view, this state
is the primordial state,

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.870 align:middle line:84%
or perfect state, of
the great perfection.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:90%
So how do we return there?

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Silverman again,
"since separation

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:10%
is the hallmark
of limit, it would

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:10%
follow that the exhortation to
love thy neighbor as thyself

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:10%
is simply a route
map for returning

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.700 align:middle line:10%
to our original status."

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:10%
In his Easter address in
2009, Pope Benedict XVI

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:10%
said, "Indeed, one of the
questions that most preoccupies

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.150 align:middle line:10%
men and women is this:
what is there after death?"

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.460 align:middle line:84%
To this mystery,
today's solemnity

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
allows us to respond
that death does not

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:84%
have the last word, because life
will be victorious at the end.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.650 align:middle line:84%
This certainty of ours is based
not on simple human reasoning,

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.800 align:middle line:84%
but on a historical
fact of faith.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:10%
Jesus Christ
crucified and buried

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:46.380 align:middle line:10%
is risen with his glorified
body, his rainbow body.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.860 align:middle line:10%
Jesus has risen so
that we, too, believing

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:10%
in him may have eternal life.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:10%
This proclamation is at the
heart of the gospel message.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.510 align:middle line:10%
And as Saint Paul
vigorously declares,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:10%
"If Christ has not been raised,
our preaching is in vain,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:10%
and your faith is in vain."

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
"The resurrection,
then, is not a theory

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:84%
but a historical reality
revealed by the man

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ by means
of his pass over,

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
his passage, that has opened
a new way between heaven

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:90%
and earth," said the Pope.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It is neither a myth nor dream.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
It is not a vision or a utopia.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
It is not a fairy tale.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is a singular, a
singularity if you will,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and unrepeatable event.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Jesus of Nazareth, son of
Mary, who at dusk on Friday

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
was taken down from
the cross and buried,

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%
has victoriously left the tomb.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at dawn on the
first day after the Sabbath,

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Peter and John found
the tomb empty.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene and
the other women

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:90%
encountered the risen Jesus.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
On the way to Emmaus,
the two disciples

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:84%
recognized him at the
breaking of the bread.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The risen one appeared
to the Apostles

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that evening in the
upper room, and then

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to many other
disciples in Galilee.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
The Pope concluded
his statement,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
saying that by a
new and living way,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
he opened through the
curtain that is his body.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
To me, the Pope is pointing
us at the secret of arcanum.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
He's telling us that
the Shroud of Turin

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is in fact an open portal
or gateway into the Heavenly

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.340 align:middle line:84%
realms, and that it's in fact
an invitation for us to open

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that portal within our
own hearts and our lives.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We conclude with
the words of Jesus

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and the Pistis Sophia
when he said, "Cease not

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:84%
to seek day and
night, and remit not

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
yourselves until you find
the purifying mysteries that

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:84%
will purify you, and make
you into a refined light,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.940 align:middle line:84%
so that you will go
on height and inherit

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.990 align:middle line:90%
the light of my kingdom."

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:90%
That is the secret of arcanum.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:84%
In Clare's Beyond
the Veil segment,

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:84%
she'll take us into the
minds of visionary artists

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.190 align:middle line:84%
who are inspired by
the Shroud of Turin.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: One may venture to
say that the Shroud of Turin

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:84%
would have to be on
many people's list

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:84%
as the top 10 artifacts to
be treasured by the world.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It truly is very
special, indeed.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
In 2010, William and I made
a pilgrimage to Turin, Italy,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.370 align:middle line:84%
to experience the Shroud
of Turin personally.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I use the word experience,
because we believe it is real.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to study
and connect with it,

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and we did in a very
powerful and memorable way.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, once encountered,
never forgotten.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:10%
We arrived at the chapel
of John the Baptist

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:10%
and were greeted by a long,
snaking line of fellow pilgrims

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.770 align:middle line:10%
in a silent procession
toward the cathedral.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:84%
We were very intrigued by
the stations of powerful art

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.590 align:middle line:90%
that we passed along the way.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:10%
they very clearly gave the
Church's view of the shroud

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.623 align:middle line:10%
as an icon of resurrection.

00:33:26.623 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Here we see Christ
carrying the cross,

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:10%
and encountering Veronica, upon
whose veil the face of Christ

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:10%
was said to be imprinted.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, we caught a peek
at the magnificent, spiraling

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:90%
stupa atop the Shrouded Chapel.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the beautiful Sun Gate
symbolism inside this stupa.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.530 align:middle line:84%
The inner sanctum
of the cathedral

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
where the shroud lies,
when on public display,

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:84%
captures the essence
of the shroud itself.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.545 align:middle line:84%
As we both sat silently
in front of the shroud

00:34:15.545 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:84%
in quiet reflection
on the magnitude

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.310 align:middle line:84%
of this priceless and
holy icon of Jesus,

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:26.949 align:middle line:84%
I thought the many
individuals over time

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.860 align:middle line:84%
who had encountered
visions of Jesus,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and even painted what they
saw with a clear likeness

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:90%
to the face on the shroud.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
William and I both had visions
of a golden being of light

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.370 align:middle line:84%
while sitting in
quiet contemplation

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:50.380 align:middle line:84%
in the seated area right in
front of the shroud itself.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We believe to this day it
was the spirit of Christ.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:35:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And this incredible icon
is indeed authentic.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The Bible does not give a
physical description of Jesus.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Why do people believe the
face on the shroud is Jesus?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.950 align:middle line:10%
The answer is the
crown of thorns.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:10%
The Bible describes
the mocking of Jesus

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:10%
before his crucifixion.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:10%
Part of this mocking
included the placement

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.300 align:middle line:10%
of a crown of
thorns on his head.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.560 align:middle line:84%
This was not done to
other crucifixion victims.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
The shroud shows
evidence of wounds

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
from sharp, spark-like spark--
The shroud shows evidence

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:41.190 align:middle line:84%
of wounds from sharp,
spike-like objects

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.870 align:middle line:90%
around the top of his head.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Shroud experts believe
a crown of thorns

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.860 align:middle line:84%
is the source of the
blood flows on the head

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.990 align:middle line:84%
of the man in the
Shroud of Turin.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Further evidence that the face
on the shroud belongs to Jesus

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
comes from an examination of
the development of Christian art

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.900 align:middle line:90%
portraying Jesus.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
This wall painting,
found in 1921

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:84%
in a house church at
Dura-Europos, Syria,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
is the earliest known
representation of Jesus

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.910 align:middle line:90%
dating from about 235 AD.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It is now part of the
Dura-Europos collection

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.970 align:middle line:84%
at the Yale University
Gallery of Fine Arts, USA.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:34.520 align:middle line:84%
This third-century fresco
of the Good Shepherd

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:84%
was found on the ceiling
of the vault of Lucina

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.185 align:middle line:84%
in the catacomb of
Callixtus in Rome.

00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:84%
The image of Jesus
as the Good Shepherd

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:84%
was an especially
popular motive in

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.790 align:middle line:90%
the early Christian centuries.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It was based on several
biblical passages,

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:84%
including the 23rd Psalm
and sayings of Jesus,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and is also an adaption
of a popular pagan image.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:08.510 align:middle line:84%
These third- to fourth-century
images of Jesus as a magician

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:84%
are from Roman sarcophagi,
now in the Vatican museum.

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:10%
This sixth-century mosaic
now in the British Museum

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:10%
is from Dorset, England.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:10%
Jesus still resembles
Apollo or Helios.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:10%
After the
sixth-century discovery

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Shroud of Turin in
Edessa, images of Jesus

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.740 align:middle line:10%
became full frontal
facial images

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.990 align:middle line:10%
with many of the features
seen on the shroud.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:10%
At Ravenna's Sant'appollinare
Nuovo Church,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.780 align:middle line:10%
we find this sixth-century
mosaic of Christ enthroned

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:10%
as the Heavenly King.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.590 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly in the sixth century,
the features of Christ in art

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:10%
were brought into focus, as
if by an invisible decree,

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:10%
says Ian Wilson.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
The hair became long and center
parted, the beard established

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and forked, the nose
longer and more pronounced,

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:17.070 align:middle line:84%
the eyes deeper,
the pupils larger.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
There is an authority
about it that

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:23.620 align:middle line:84%
seems to suggest that
someone, somewhere, suddenly

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.940 align:middle line:90%
knew what Jesus had looked like.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:84%
If the face on the
shroud inspired this art,

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.235 align:middle line:84%
it happened in
the sixth century.

00:38:32.235 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.640 align:middle line:84%
This sixth-century
hammered silver vase

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.380 align:middle line:84%
was discovered
among church ruins

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:90%
at Homs ancient Emesa in Syria.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most famous
Christ pantocrator icons.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It is found at St. Catharine's
monastery in the Sinai,

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and is believed to
date from about 550 AD.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It is widely thought
to have been sourced

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.050 align:middle line:84%
from the image on
the Shroud of Turin.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Interesting observation
of this precious icon

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:14.880 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol on the book
Jesus holds in his left arm.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The symbol is of the Chintamani,
the wish-fulfilling jewel,

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.690 align:middle line:84%
within both Hindu and
Buddhist traditions.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It is equivalent to
the Philosopher's Stone

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.870 align:middle line:90%
in Western alchemy.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:84%
In 1902, Paul Vignon, a French
scholar and early student

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud, identified
several common characteristics

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of early artistic
pictures of Jesus.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:84%
These characteristics emerged
starting in the sixth century,

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
about the time
that the shroud was

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:84%
found hidden high in
a wall of the city.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:10%
These are all, to some degree,
found on the Shroud of Turin.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:10%
The Vignon markings, as
they have come to be called,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.470 align:middle line:10%
all appear on the shroud as
part of the image of the man--

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:10%
or as anomalies, in the cloth.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Vignon paid particular attention
to an eight-century Christ

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
pantocrator, from the catacomb
of Saint Ponteneau, Rome.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.840 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be later than
the eighth century,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:84%
because the catacomb was
closed down in 820 AD,

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and only reopened in 1852.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.630 align:middle line:84%
On the forehead
between the eyebrows

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.010 align:middle line:84%
of this work, a
starkly geometrical,

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:43.000 align:middle line:90%
U shape caught his eye.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:84%
He found the same
marking on the shroud.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Vignon found the same U shape,
and the shroud likeness,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.970 align:middle line:84%
in the Christ pantocrator
from the 11th century dome

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Church of
Daphne near Athens.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:10%
Clearly shown are
two wisps of hair

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.910 align:middle line:10%
in the center of the forehead,
hair on one side of the head

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:10%
shorter than on
the other side, a U

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.530 align:middle line:10%
shape between the
eyebrows-- often

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:21.885 align:middle line:10%
square-bottomed-- a
downward-pointing triangle or V

00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:10%
on the bridge of the nose, and
one raised eyebrow, large round

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:10%
eyes accents on both
cheeks somewhat lower

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.440 align:middle line:10%
the right cheek, a
forked beard, a gap

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.100 align:middle line:10%
in the beard below
the lower lip,

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:10%
and an enlarged left nostril,
an accent line below the nose,

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.950 align:middle line:10%
and a dark line just
below the lower lip.

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.996 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that
the Shroud of Turin,

00:41:54.996 --> 00:41:59.320 align:middle line:84%
then the Image of Edessa,
was the original inspiration

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:84%
for various works of
art with these markings.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:84%
These images prove
the shroud was

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in existence in
the sixth century,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and is not a
12th-century forgery.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Wilson points to this
10th-century example

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
of the shroud likeness--
the Christ-enthroned fresco

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:28.560 align:middle line:84%
in the Church of Sant'Angelo
in Formis near Capua, Italy.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This late 11th-century
Romanesque fresco

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:84%
of Christ pantocrator
in Novalesa Abbey

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.670 align:middle line:84%
shows the Vignon markings
and the triple dot Chintamani

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:42.960 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:84%
From the 12th century, there
is an excellent example

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Christ pantocrator
mosaic in the apse of the Norman

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Byzantine church
of Cefalu, Sicily.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:43:03.140 align:middle line:84%
In 1978, historian
Ian Wilson pointed out

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that the pray manuscript
was one of a small number

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of 11th to 12th century
deposition scenes.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, depictions
of Christ's descent

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.740 align:middle line:84%
from the cross--
that was strongly

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:84%
reminiscent of the Shroud of
Turin in that they depicted

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
the dead Christ being laid onto
a large, double-length piece

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of linen intended to envelop
his body over his head,

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:38.110 align:middle line:84%
with his hands crossed in
front, right hand over the left,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:90%
as on the shroud.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.330 align:middle line:10%
This likeness can be
found in the 13th century

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:48.945 align:middle line:10%
mosaic of Christ enthroned
in the gallery of Hagia

00:43:48.945 --> 00:43:57.080 align:middle line:10%
Sophia, Constantinople,
and also in the DC mosaic

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.925 align:middle line:10%
at Hagia Sophia.

00:43:57.925 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Finally, in the 15th century,
we find one ideal work of art

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:84%
with which to compare
the shroud image.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This is none other than Jan
Van Eyck and his Rex Regnum.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Although the original
has not survived,

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:84%
it is known to us
from four copies

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.350 align:middle line:90%
that were made at that time.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It has the same rigidly
front-facing aspect

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of the shroud face.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Other distinctive features
that match the shroud exactly

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:37.700 align:middle line:84%
include: long hair
parted in the middle

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and falling to the shoulders,
moderately long forked

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:84%
beard, long prominent
nose, thin mustache

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
drooping to join the beard, a
hairless gap beneath the lower

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.650 align:middle line:90%
lip.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:56.500 align:middle line:84%
As Wilson says,
it might have been

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.870 align:middle line:90%
copied from the shroud face.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Did Jan van Eyck have
access to the shroud?

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Art experts say
Van Eyck derived it

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.690 align:middle line:84%
from Christ
portraits of the East

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.040 align:middle line:84%
from Byzantium, in which
artists routinely copied

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the same likeness of Christ
from an earlier source.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Might Van Eyck have had a
vision of the man in the shroud?

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.510 align:middle line:10%
Van Eyck's painting of
the resurrected Christ

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:10%
in a halo of rainbow light
is also based on the shroud.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.575 align:middle line:84%
But again, is it possible Van
Eyck saw this face in a vision,

00:45:41.575 --> 00:45:42.075 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Heinrich Kaufmann
was one such painter,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
who captured the image of Jesus
in his many religious works

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:90%
of art in the late 1800s.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Another artist was Turkish-born
Ariel Pascal Agemian

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:07.850 align:middle line:84%
who studied in Venice throughout
Italy, France, and America.

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It was in 1935 that he painted
the well-known "Face of Christ"

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.060 align:middle line:84%
based on the negative
of the Shroud of Turin,

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
receiving accolade
from science experts,

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and eventually awarded a gold
medal from Pope Pius XII,

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and knighted into the order
of Saint Gregory the Great.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Another visionary
artist alive today

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.340 align:middle line:10%
is Nanette Christ,
whose ancestors

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.310 align:middle line:10%
were icon painters of the
Eastern Orthodox church.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:10%
Nanette's beautiful painting
of Christ is world famous,

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:10%
and has touched millions
of people in their lives.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.600 align:middle line:84%
She writes about the
extraordinary manifestation

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:84%
of this beautiful
painting, that she

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:84%
was directed to paint
from her sacred vision.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It was on the Thursday
before Easter in 1986,

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
when she had prayed before easel
before beginning a painting.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, she experienced
a clear vision

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of the presence of Jesus
standing beside the easel

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and bathed in very bright light.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Nanette described Jesus'
face with a gentle strength,

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, penetrating gray-blue
eyes, and light auburn hair,

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.010 align:middle line:90%
and wearing a pearly-white robe.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:90%
His chest was broad.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:84%
He was quite tall, she writes,
with a perfect posture.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Nanette was asked by
Jesus to paint his image

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
in his likeness, so that
everyone who believed in him

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and loved him would be
able to look into his eyes

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.830 align:middle line:90%
and connect to his soul.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The painting took
Nanette three days,

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and she completed
it on Easter Sunday.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.290 align:middle line:84%
The final masterpiece
was authenticated

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
by the visionaries
of the Catholic

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Church and other faiths.

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Could the shroud have
been left for mankind

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:37.080 align:middle line:84%
for this very reason, for
man to connect and remember

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the message that Jesus left us
all; to live in his footsteps

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:49.510 align:middle line:90%
under the canopy of pure love?

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
the shroud has been

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.180 align:middle line:84%
a subject of immense
fascination, if not obsession,

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
with history's greatest
visionary artists.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.040 align:middle line:84%
One can only wonder
how future visionary

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.050 align:middle line:90%
artists will portray the shroud.

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Will the visionary mind
develop even further

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.170 align:middle line:84%
in its spiritual evolution,
as the human race

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.610 align:middle line:90%
evolves in the Golden Age?

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:23.380 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, the shroud
went digital.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.290 align:middle line:84%
The Shroud 2.0 app was
authorized by the Turin

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:31.330 align:middle line:84%
archdiocese, and is now
available for downloads

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.430 align:middle line:90%
on iTunes.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This allows one to explore
the sheet in detail

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.100 align:middle line:84%
through access to an excellent,
high-definition photographic

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.725 align:middle line:84%
document that
offers features that

00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:48.020 align:middle line:84%
are almost invisible to
the naked eye, elements

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that not even the traditional
expositions have ever

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.850 align:middle line:90%
allowed to observe.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.390 align:middle line:84%
As sacred visionary
art goes digital,

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:84%
will this enable people
to connect with the shroud

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.970 align:middle line:90%
more directly?

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Or will it diminish
the connection?

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:11.432 align:middle line:90%
Time will tell.

00:50:11.432 --> 00:50:12.640 align:middle line:90%
