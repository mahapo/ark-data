00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
The ancients knew a lot
about the soul and ascension.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They believed our soul
embodies the quality

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
of eggness, the power of
becoming golden beings.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The egg contains within
itself all the essentials

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:90%
for development.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
If we are the microcosm
of the macrocosm,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
then our tiny egg must
contain within it the secrets

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:90%
of the universal cosmic egg.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:84%
By the right methods,
the power of our soul

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
can be aligned with the
powers of the great world egg,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and we can ascend.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, yoga,
prayer, visualization all

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
align the soul with
its highest powers.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the understanding
of where our soul comes from.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
How did our soul
get into our body?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Without an understanding
of our soul,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:90%
many think we're powerless.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We will continue
to strive for power

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and will be motivated by and
addicted to the love of power.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
With the understanding
of our soul,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:90%
we gain the power of love.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:90%
So how are our souls created?

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Where did our soul come from?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And how do they
enter into our body?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:84%
The answer is there
are as many views

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
as there are directions--
north, south,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:90%
east, west, down, inner, outer.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And in order to get
a comprehensive view

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
of how our soul was created,
we must go in all directions.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The reward for our
search is immense.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of
Thomas, the disciples

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
said to Jesus, "Tell us
how our end will be."

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said, "Have
you discovered, then,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
the beginning, that
you look for the end?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
For where the beginning
is, there will the end.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And blessed is he who will take
his place in the beginning.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
He will know the end and
will not experience death."

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Exploring the origin or
beginning of our soul,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that is the key to
overcoming our addiction

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to power and our greatest
fear, the fear of death itself.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It is also the key
to immortality.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Discovering the
origins of the soul

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:90%
is a question for metaphysics.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
This is because science,
physics, hasn't yet

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
detected the soul
existing in experiments.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Science is based on verifiable
and repeatable testing

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
or experiments done in
a laboratory setting

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
presently has almost

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
nothing to say about the
soul one way or the other.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
To answer the
questions of the soul

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
requires an entirely new
science and different physics

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:90%
than we presently have.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But the good news
is, this is emerging.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:10%
This new science is part
of our present awakening.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.326 align:middle line:10%
At the core of this new
science is the search

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:10%
for the God particle.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
The finding of elusive
Higgs boson, or God

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
particle, as it's called, by the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
in 2012 has been called the
greatest scientific discovery

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:90%
of the 21st century.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It gave scientists
keys to unlocking

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
the origins of the universe
and how it was created.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
It has also triggered
global discussions

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
on the convergence of
science and spirituality

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
and possibly the
origins of our souls.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Like the soul, the Higgs
boson, the God particle,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is considered a
packet of energy that

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
is associated with an invisible
background energy field called

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the Higgs field, which
is theorized to pervade

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
the universe, just like the
idea of the Holy Spirit.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:10%
This Higgs field is
responsible for imparting mass

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:10%
to all the other elementary
particles in our universe

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:10%
through a process known
as the Higgs mechanism.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:10%
The thing is, mystics say
exactly the same thing

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:10%
about our soul.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is what
gives matter life.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
This Higgs mechanism
is all physics, though,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
say scientists.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no divine
intervention whatsoever,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:90%
nothing spiritual going on.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:84%
A correlating theory
to the God particle

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is the theory of
supersymmetry, which is also

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:90%
affected by the Higgs discover.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
This idea posits that every
known particle in the universe

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
has a super particle
with slightly

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:90%
different characteristics.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is this
mirrors the gnostic view

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that the soul also
has a super-partner,

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
a celestial counterpart with
heavenly characteristics.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:10%
So there are some very
interesting parallels

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:10%
between the Holy Spirit
and the Higgs field,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:10%
and the God particle and the
divine particle, our soul.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
In the introduction to his
book "The God Particle," which

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is the authoritative
book on the subject,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Leon Lederman
said that he wanted

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to call the God particle
the Goddamn particle

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
because it has been so
elusive and difficult to find.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
The same thing can
be said of our soul.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Lederman went on to say
that what they were really

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:10%
doing at CERN in building
the Large Hadron Collider,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:10%
this 17-mile ring,
which was the most

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:10%
expensive and sophisticated
machine on Earth,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:10%
was recreating the ancient
story of the tower of Babel.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:84%
That got my attention, as the
Tower of Babel, also called

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
the Stairway to
Heaven, can clearly

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
be viewed as some form of a
soul portal, or a stargate.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Building and ascending
this tower within

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is also a metaphor for
the soul's journey,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
as is the building of the Large
Hadron Collider, the particle

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:90%
accelerator at CERN.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:10%
So I went to CERN near
Geneva, Switzerland in 2007,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:10%
looking for evidence
that they were actually

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:10%
building a stargate
and maybe looking

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:10%
for the secrets of
the soul and that this

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:10%
would be telegraphed in the
art and symbolism found there.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I happen to be on one
of the last public tours

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
in the cathedral, as the room
housing the Atlas detector was

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
known before the Large
Hadron Collider was

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:90%
sealed and switched on.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
The Atlas detector is the
world's largest machine.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a giant camera
built to see the God particle

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and was accessed
via this blue door.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
The Large Hadron
Collider's purpose

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
is to smash protons moving at
99.999% of the speed of light

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:84%
into each other and so recreate
the conditions a nano fraction

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:90%
of a second after the Big Bang.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Then Atlas could take a
picture of this event.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought the eight-spoked
wheel of the Atlas detector

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
looked exactly like eight-spoked
wheel the Mayans said

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:84%
symbolized the
galactic center and out

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of which Maya scholar John Major
Jenkins proposed Quetzalcoatl,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:90%
the Mayan savior, would emerge.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The God particle's
discovery in 2012

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
accelerated the shift in
consciousness the Mayans said

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
would occur in that
year when Quetzalcoatl

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:84%
would return from an opening
in the center of the Milky Way

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I also was kind of curious
to see that Atlas also

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
resembled the geometric pattern
of an eight-spoked Tibetan

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
mandala, or Dharma wheel,
the wheel of transformation.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:10%
The eight spokes of the wheel
symbolize the noble Eightfold

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:10%
Path set up by the
Buddha in his teachings

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:10%
to discern-- no pun intended,
or perhaps pun intended--

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:10%
the true nature of reality.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
The eight-petaled lotus, seen
in Buddhist meditation mandalas,

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the Eightfold
Path, the good law,

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic harmony,
and is regarded

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:90%
as the egg of the world.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
During my visit to
CERN, I remember

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
stepping off the elevator
that took us deep underground

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and being stopped dead in
my tracks by this sign.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:84%
"Recreating the conditions
just after the Big Bang."

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.870 align:middle line:84%
This was astonishing to me,
because in Jewish prophecy when

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
the Messiah appears,
he will reveal

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
the light that's shown during
the first week of creation.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:84%
This sounded to me exactly like
what they're doing at CERN.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
In the book Genesis,
this time period

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
is referred to as the
six days of creation.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Jewish mythology,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
the building material
for all human beings

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
was created at this time.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
This may have been
the exact moment

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:90%
that our souls were created.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I'm not saying
that the God particle

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:90%
is the same as our soul.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But it is in the same
soup at the same time.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists
at CERN are looking

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:84%
at the exact moment
in time when our souls

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
were said to be created and
are describing the God particle

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:90%
in terms that fit the soul.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked around
CERN, I could only

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
wonder what they might
discover about our soul there

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and if the new
physics is actually

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:90%
the physics of the soul.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I found spectacular
art at CERN that

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:90%
actually relates to the soul.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
At CERN, a dove, which
is the symbol of peace

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:84%
or the Holy Spirit
in Christianity,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
is seen spraying
the God particle.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
That inspires me,
because it's exactly

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:84%
like Leonardo's
painting of the dove

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
spraying the Holy Spirit
at the baptism of Christ.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.865 align:middle line:10%
Another example is
the icon, or logo,

00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:10%
of CERN's particle
physics newsletter,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:10%
which is a stylized version of
the decay of the God particle.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:10%
It fits beautifully over the
Transfiguration of Jesus,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:10%
where we see the three rays
that indicate enlightenment.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:84%
This statue of the lord
of the ring or dance,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.970 align:middle line:84%
who stamps out
ignorance, was a gift

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Department
of Atomic Energy

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
from the government of India.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The inscription reads, "Oh,
omnipresent the embodiment

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
of all virtues, the creator
of this cosmic universe,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
the king of dancers, who dances
the [INAUDIBLE] in twilight,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I salute thee."

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
In the Indian knowledge system
going back to 7,000 years,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic egg is
known as Hiranyagarbha,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:90%
meaning a golden-hued womb.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Big Bang is expressed
as Brahmanda Visphotak

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
or universal explosion.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:10%
The resulting
cosmic soup has been

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:10%
described as one in which
the subatomic particles,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:10%
such as quarks and gluons,
are floating freely

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:10%
without the influence
of any force

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.620 align:middle line:10%
upon them until the presence
of the God particle, the Higgs

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:10%
boson, creates an energy field
in which they interact and gain

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:10%
mass.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, the God
particle and the soul

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:90%
are strikingly intertwined.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And some believe
our souls are not

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.610 align:middle line:84%
formed until the
Holy Spirit interacts

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:90%
with mass, meaning our bodies.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So why is it that every time a
new discovery on the frontiers

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
of science is made
there is already

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:84%
a preexisting parallel event in
ancient stories about the soul?

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have shown that
the way the ancient Egyptians

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
portrayed the soul's
ascension, its ascension shift,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Millions of
Years, or Ship of Eternity,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
precisely matches the way modern
science portrays a wormhole,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
tells me that scientists
working at the farthest

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:84%
edges of science would
benefit from ancient knowledge

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, that
is, if they want

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to build a bridge from
the material world

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
to the immaterial world,
from standard physics to soul

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
This new science that
we are now discovering

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
is the lost science
of ascension.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So now let's turn
to ancient theories

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
about how our souls were
created and how they entered

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
into our physical bodies.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We can't possibly come
to an ultimate answer,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
but we can overview
the key perspectives.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
No matter if you're Jewish,
Christian, Muslim, Buddhist,

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Hindu, or believe an ancient
alien intelligent design,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
your belief in how the soul
was created or imparted

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
into your body will fall
into one of these categories.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you either
believe God created your soul

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the body, your
parents generated your soul,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
or you did it yourself.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
One view of how
the soul is created

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is called traducianism,
or the theory

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that a soul is generated
with the physical parents

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
along with the physical body.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
From the Latin word "traducio",
which means a transmission

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or transfer, traducianism is
the generation and transmission

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
of the children's
soul by the parents.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Support for traducianism
is in the Bible.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
It's found in Genesis
2:7, where God formed man

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
from the dust of the ground
and breathed the breath of life

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:84%
into Adam, causing Adam
to become a living soul.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Scripture nowhere records God
performing this action again.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This soul transference
through breath

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in art as God
beaming light, or breath,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
to Adam, or even Adam
enfolded in light.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.890 align:middle line:84%
This is also the subject of
Michelangelo's masterpiece,

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:84%
"The Creation of Adam"
in the Sistine Chapel.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
The image of the near-touching
hands of God and Adam

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:90%
has become iconic of humanity.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is one of the
most reproduced paintings

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
God's right arm is outstretched
to impart the spark of life

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
from his own finger
into that of Adam,

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
whose left hand
mirrors that of God's.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The message here is that we
are made in the image of God,

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and God transfers the soul
into our body upon birth.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that the brain
is considered the seat

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of the soul of the human body.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And Michelangelo portrays God
activating Adam's divine spark,

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
his soul, through
thought, and God

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
manifests in a cloud that is
shaped just like a human brain.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, it
has been observed

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
that the red cloth around God
in Michelangelo's painting

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:90%
has the shape of a human uterus.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
One art historian has
called it a uterine mantle

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and that the scarf hanging
out, colored green,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:84%
could be a newly
cut umbilical cord.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, a group
of Italian researchers

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.540 align:middle line:84%
published in "Mayo
Clinic Proceedings"

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
an article where the images of
the mantle and the postpartum

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:90%
uterus were overlapped.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And according Enrico
Bruschini, there

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:84%
is an interesting hypothesis
that presents the creation

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
scene as an idealized
representation

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of the physical birth of
man, only in this view,

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
our soul comes not through
thought, but from the uterus.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Following this
feminine perspective

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
leads us to some very
interesting places.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
For example, Hildegard
of Bingen beautifully

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
portrayed the
transference of the soul

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
from the celestial
realms directly

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
into the womb via a
conduit, or umbilical cord.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
In her painting, we see
several figures holding

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
bowls with cheese and
a golden umbilical cord

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:90%
upon which the soul rides.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.690 align:middle line:10%
Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam teach that not only

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:10%
Adam's soul, but his
sin, or imperfection,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:10%
were also transferred or
transmittal to all other humans

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.720 align:middle line:10%
by heredity and as a
psychological story.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This sin was incurred when
Eve spoke with a serpent,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and they realized
they were naked.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Eve cracked the reptilian
code, so to speak,

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
and humanity paid the price.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Adam's sin, we are told,
affects all man, both physically

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and spiritually.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
This makes sense only
if the body and soul

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.295 align:middle line:84%
both come from the parents,
be they Adam and Eve

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:58.036 align:middle line:84%
or the Annunaki or
some other being.

00:16:58.036 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
After the fall of
Adam and Eve and they

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
were barred from
the Tree of Life,

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
a gate was placed
at the east of Eden

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Judeo-Christian story.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
This fall is the basis
for Western civilization

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:16.005 align:middle line:84%
and our drive to return to
Eden and our original state

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:90%
of perfection as light beings.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
Because in the mystical
Jewish tradition,

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve were
originally beings of light.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
After Adam and Eve
were evicted from Eden,

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
this is when humanity were given
coats of skin, not animal skin,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:90%
but our human skin.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And our ultimate soul
quest is to transcend

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
our biology, our flesh, and
return to our original state

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
as perfected light beings.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
This teaching proposes
that we're actually

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
shells of our former,
original existence.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet we are all capable
of purifying our soul,

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
coming out of our
shell, so to speak,

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and reacquiring our
original light bodies.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The weakness of
traducianism as a theory

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:84%
is that the Bible is unclear
how an immaterial soul can

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
be generated through an
entirely physical process.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
traducianism can only be
true if the body and soul

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are inextricably
connected if they're one.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
In contrast with
traducianism is the idea

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:90%
of creationism of the soul.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
This is the view
that God directly

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
creates a new soul when every
human being is conceived.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Creationism was upheld by
many early church fathers

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:90%
and is a biblical concept.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
The Bible actually
differentiates the origin

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
of the soul from the
origin of the body.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So if God creates
each individual soul

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
at the moment it is needed, the
separation of the body and soul

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:90%
is the correct viewpoint.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
However, the critique
against creationism

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is that it has God continually
creating new human souls,

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:84%
while the book of
Genesis clearly indicates

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:90%
that God stopped creating.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Both the traducianist view
and the creationist view

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
agree that the soul does not
exist prior to conception.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:84%
That means we're free floating
somewhere else in the cosmos

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
before we take on our
physical incarnation.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as
conception takes place,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:90%
a soul is attached to the body.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.530 align:middle line:84%
This seems to be the clear
teaching of the Bible, anyway.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that before
birth, the soul is not on Earth,

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
but after conception,
it is woven

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:90%
into the matrix of Earth life.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
In this view, whether God
creates a new human soul

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of conception
or whether God designed

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
the human reproductive process
to also reproduce a cell,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
God is ultimately
responsible for the creation

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of each and every human soul.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
A third view of soul
creation is the concept

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:84%
that God created all human
souls at the same time

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and attaches a soul
to a human being

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
This view holds that there is
a sort of a warehouse of souls

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
in heaven, where God stores
souls that await a human body

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:90%
to be attached to.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, this view is
not biblically supported

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and is criticized
as being too New Age

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
or hinting at reincarnation,
which is a concept disavowed

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:90%
by Christianity.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
In the Judeo-Christian
tradition,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the soul lives
its life and then,

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
according to what he believes
or does during this life,

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.930 align:middle line:84%
he either goes to eternal
hell or eternal heaven

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to live with the other perfected
ones, as they are described.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But according to others outside
the Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.380 align:middle line:84%
humanists and
scientists, for example,

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the individual soul comes
into being at conception

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
due to natural causes,
lives, and then at death

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:90%
ceases to exist.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
In this view, we're worm food
when we're dead, and that's it.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:84%
But another view rejects
all the previous views

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:90%
we've just discussed.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:90%
And that is Buddhism.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:84%
As explained on Buddhanet.net,
traducianism gives rise

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.600 align:middle line:90%
to too many ethical problems.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
If a good God really
creates each of us,

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists ask, then
how do we explain

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
why so many people are
born with deformities

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
or why billions of children are
miscarried just before birth

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.692 align:middle line:90%
or they're stillborn?

00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Another problem
that Buddhists have

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
with the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
explanation

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is that it seems very unjust
that a person should suffer

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
eternal pain and hell for what
they did in just 60 or 70 years

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Does 60 or 70 years of
non-belief or immoral living

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:90%
really deserve eternal torture?

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, is 60 or 70 years of
good living enough of an effort

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:90%
for eternal bliss in heaven?

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
The second explanation
is better than the first

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and has more scientific
evidence to support it,

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but it still leaves several
really important questions

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:90%
unanswered.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism offers
another explanation

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of where soul came from
and where we're going.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
When we die, the mind,
with all its tendencies,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.815 align:middle line:84%
preferences,
abilities, memories,

00:22:26.815 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and characteristics that have
been developed and conditioned

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:84%
in this life and all
others reestablishes itself

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:90%
in a fertilized egg.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the individual
grows, is reborn,

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and develops
personality, conditioned

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
both by the mental
characteristics that

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:84%
have been carried over and
by the new environment.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Our soul's personality
will change

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and be modified by conscious
effort and programming factors

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
like our education,
parental influence, culture.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then once again at
death, we reestablish ourself

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:90%
in a new fertilized egg.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
This process of dying and
being reborn in one egg

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
after another will continue
until the conditions that

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:84%
cause it, this rebirth, mostly
craving and ignorance, cease.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So what decides where
we will be reborn?

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism and Hinduism, the
most important factor, but not

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:84%
the only one, influencing
where we will be reborn

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and what sort of life
we will have is karma.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
The work "karma" means
action and refers

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to our intentional
mental actions.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the sum of our actions
and intentions in this

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and all previous
states of existence.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what we
are is determined very much

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
by how we have thought
and acted in the past.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, our intentions,
how we think and act now,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
will influence how we
will be in the future.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
The endless knot,
or eternal knot,

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
represents the interwoven and
ever-changing spiritual path

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Another symbol, the Ouroboros,
or serpent biting its tail,

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
also symbolizes the
beginning and the end

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
or the eternal round
of reincarnation.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.570 align:middle line:84%
The lotus symbolically
represents karma

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:90%
in many ancient traditions.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.720 align:middle line:84%
A blooming lotus flower
is one of the few flowers

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that simultaneously
carries seeds

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:90%
inside itself while it blooms.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the seed is
symbolically seen as cause,

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and the flower is the effect.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The lotus is also
considered as a reminder

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
that one can grow even
from mud, share good karma,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and remain unstained, even
in murky circumstances where

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:90%
there is suffering.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
To Buddhists, our soul is
the jewel in the lotus.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It may even be the mysterious
blue stone in the lotus

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:90%
that the Annunaki sought.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we can be reborn,
literally and figuratively,

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
the lotus is the representation
of our reincarnation,

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.930 align:middle line:84%
when the soul is reborn
in another world.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The gentle, loving
type of person

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
tends to be reborn
in a heaven realm

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
or as a human being
who has a predominance

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.715 align:middle line:90%
of pleasant experiences.

00:25:23.715 --> 00:25:27.610 align:middle line:84%
The anxious, worried, or
extremely cruel type of person

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.050 align:middle line:84%
tends to be reborn
in a hell realm

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:84%
or as a human being
who has a predominance

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:90%
of painful experiences.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So the message is we're
not doomed by our karma.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:90%
We can change it.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, instead
of being reborn,

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
the mind attains a
state called nirvana,

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.896 align:middle line:84%
and this is the ultimate
goal of Buddhism

00:25:51.896 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and the purpose of life.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:84%
We will choose to be
reborn again and again

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and again as cosmic eggs
until we reach nirvana.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We become lotus-born
cloud-riders,

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:10.240 align:middle line:84%
like the light-body guru
Padmasambhava or Jesus.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana is actually heaven
to the Christians, when

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic particles in the
body of the cosmic Christ

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:90%
are reunited.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:23.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the resurrected
Christ and perfected

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
souls in the dome of the
baptistery in Florence, Italy.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The octagon that we
see here symbolizes

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
rebirth and resurrection
and corresponds

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.370 align:middle line:84%
with the eightfold noble
path and the eightfold path

of the soul.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
As we contemplate the divine
particle within us, the God

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
particle, our
soul, and the field

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:84%
out of which this
jewel emerge, we

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:84%
can see the jewel,
or God particle,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of the eight-spoked
Atlas detector at CERN.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
We can see that it's just
like the opening of a lotus.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
In March of 2016,
indications of a new physics

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:90%
may have been spotted at CERN.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Scientists there say they might
have spotted the first traces

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
of physics beyond the
standard model, which

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:90%
traces the structure of matter.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
The Beauty meson, a
new elementary particle

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that decays in a charmed
particle, they say,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:84%
could poke a hole in
the standard model.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:30.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one more sure sign
of our cosmic awakening,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:84%
but there is much,
much more to come.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, stay
humble, let your light shine,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and namaste.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.000 align:middle line:90%
This is William Henry.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.
