>> WILLIAM HENRY: What if
the first President of United

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:84%
States was also the first
American to ascend to heaven?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE HENRY: On this
episode of "Arcanum,"

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:84%
the Ascension of
George Washington.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Ascension refers
to climbing, or rising upward.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Spiritually, it refers
to taking our body into heaven

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:90%
while we are still alive.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Can ordinary people
rise or ascend to the divine?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Numerous spiritual
traditions tell us we can.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Doing so requires a
transformation of our bodies

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:90%
into a subtler form.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.279 align:middle line:90%
This is the secret of arcanum.

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Jewish mystics,
known as the Essenes,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
tell the story of Enoch, who
was an ordinary man who was

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
translated to heaven
while still alive.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He had help from the archangel
Michael, who anointed him

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
with an oil that dissolved
his body into rainbow colored

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Enoch's extraordinary
story was lost until James

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.354 align:middle line:84%
Bruce discovered the
Book of Enoch in 1773.

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Strangely,
just three years later,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:84%
George Washington became
America's first president.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Washington was revered
as an ordinary man who was able

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish the extraordinary
when he led the first Americans

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to freedom, and the founding
of a new nation dedicated

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
the freedom and liberty
of the individual.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: Some even believe
Washington was divinely guided

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:90%
in this endeavor.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
What many don't
realize is that Masons

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
eulogized George
Washington as Enoch.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Depictions of Washington
after his death

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.956 align:middle line:84%
often portrayed him ascending
into heaven like Enoch.

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
What exactly are
trying to say here?

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> CLARE: Perhaps the
most astounding depictions

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of the ascended Washington is
in the dome of the US Capitol.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the most
profound ascension images

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
to be found anywhere.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And in his feature
investigation,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
William will take you inside
the arcanum in the US Capitol.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.519 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> WILLIAM: I'd like to begin
my presentation today with some

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
quotes about the US Capitol
as a temple of ascension,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:90%
or apotheosis.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
We begin with this quote
that's inscribed in the House

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
wing of the Capitol
in the 1830s.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
It's by Rufus Choate, who was a
congressman from Massachusetts

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
who said, "We have built
no temple but the Capitol.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
We consult no common oracle
but the Constitution."

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.530 align:middle line:10%
These are religious
terms that are

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:10%
being used to describe a civic
building, the US Capitol, as

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:10%
a temple, and the Constitution
as a divinely received oracle,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:10%
or manuscript.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:10%
An 18th century poet
named Benjamin Russell

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:10%
envisioned the Capitol's
dome in his tome, "The Birth

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:10%
of Columbia," which was
published on December 3, 1788.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:10%
He writes, "Behold the
FEDERAL DOME majestic rise,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:10%
on lofty pillars reared whose
ample base on firm foundations

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:10%
laid unmoved shall stand till
happy your unnumbered circles

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:10%
run the TEMPLE OF
CELESTIAL LIBERTY!

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:10%
who designs from heaven to
bless our happy plains."

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:10%
This expresses the belief
that the US Capitol

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:10%
was conceived as a temple
of celestial liberty.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
A star temple that was there as
a shining beacon, whose design

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
was brought from heaven
to Earth to stand

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
as a beacon of light
for hope and liberty.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Congressman James
Wilson of Pennsylvania

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
prophesied in 1787
that America's

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
new federal government
would, quote,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
"lay a foundation for
erecting temples of liberty

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in every part of
the earth," unquote.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, telling us that
the Founding Fathers

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and the founders
of America believed

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that the US Capitol was,
in fact, a temple that

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
was divinely ordained to spread
freedom throughout the world.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson, the
Capitol's chief visionary

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
called it "the first
temple dedicated

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
to the sovereignty
of the people."

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
This had never happened
in human history

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
before, where a
nation was founded

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that was dedicated
to liberty, freedom,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and the sovereignty, the
ascension, of the individual.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:84%
An anonymous essay of 1795
described the Capitol building

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:90%
as a temple erected to liberty.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:90%
So you get the idea.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again,
this profound concept

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is pulled out of the
imagination of Jefferson

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and rendered in stone
in the nation's Capitol.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.582 align:middle line:10%
"It would be unbecoming,"
says John Adams,

00:05:23.582 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:10%
"the representatives
of this nation

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:10%
to assemble for the first
time in this solemn temple

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.430 align:middle line:10%
without looking up to the
Supreme Ruler of the Universe

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:10%
and imploring His blessing."

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.680 align:middle line:10%
This is President Adams
speaking on November 22, 1800,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:10%
opening the Second Session
of the Sixth Congress

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:10%
in the new Capitol building.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:10%
So over and over
again, these men

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:10%
are telling us that the
Capitol is a temple,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:10%
and America is a
divinely ordained nation.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:10%
These words are
more than poetic.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:84%
The US Capitol, in fact, has
numerous architectural features

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and other features that
unquestionably identify it

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%
with ancient temples.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So, the stone construction
and underground entrance,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:84%
chapels, an image of deified
being-- George Washington,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.235 align:middle line:84%
as we'll see in a moment--
religious imagery, symbols

00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and inscriptions, divine
proportion, sacred geometry,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:84%
massive columns, palpable
spiritual energy,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:84%
acoustic trickery,
terrifying guardians,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
who today carry automatic
weapons, mystic visitors,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
closed doors, private members,
secret chambers, and especially

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
an orientation to
the sun tell us

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that the US Capitol
is, in fact, a temple.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, the founders
of the Capitol Temple

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
likened it to Solomon's
Temple in Jerusalem.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is a key
to understanding

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:10%
the symbolism of the
US Capitol Temple.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:10%
Here we see Solomon's Temple
with a domed roof and obelisks

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:10%
from a Masonic songbook, from
a Grand Lodge in England.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the thing.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Judeo Christian
end-time prophecy

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:10%
envisions the construction of
the third temple of Solomon,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:10%
the first two having been
destroyed in ancient times.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And they believe
that this new temple

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
would be associated with the
coming of the Jewish Messiah,

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.479 align:middle line:90%
or the Messianic Era.

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And in Christianity,
this, of course,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
is the second coming of Christ.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
This rendition of
Solomon's Temple

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%
is envisioned with a dome.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
The Bible says nothing about
a dome on Solomon's Temple.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:10%
But yet, the Masons were clear
in their artistic renderings

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon's Temple that,
in fact, it was domed.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.390 align:middle line:10%
In this rendering
from England, we

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:10%
see the pillars out front with
the domed Temple of Solomon

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:10%
looking rather like
a beehive, in fact.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:10%
Where did they get this idea?

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, it might have
come from the Vatican.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking at here
is Perugino's painting

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:10%
of "Christ Giving the
Keys to St. Peter."

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the more powerful
paintings in the Vatican.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:10%
When the cardinals gather
to elect the new pope,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:10%
the individual in
the chapel that

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:10%
sleeps beneath this
painting is considered

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:10%
to be the most
favored individual.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:10%
And what we see here is Christ
giving the keys to Peter.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And in the background,
we see Solomon's temple.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, it is domed.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:10%
What Perugino shows us here
is not only a domed Temple

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon, but also
that dome sitting

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:10%
on an octagonal platform.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:10%
So here's Christ giving
the keys to Peter.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:10%
And then in the background,
the domed Temple of Solomon

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:10%
on an octagonal platform.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:10%
I want you remember this,
because when we later

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:10%
explore the diagrams
of US Capitol,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:10%
we're going to see
that it, too, the dome

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:10%
also sits on an
octagonal platform.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:10%
And here is the detail.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:10%
Now here is the US
Capitol in 1830.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:10%
We see the east entrance
here with the dome,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:10%
as it then existed, on top.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:10%
Now let's compare that
with Perugino's painting

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:10%
in the Vatican.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see they're virtually
identical structures.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And one wonders if, in fact,
the Founding Fathers actually

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:10%
got the design off of Perugino's
painting in the Vatican.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:10%
Rafael also painted a
domed Temple of Solomon.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:10%
Here is "The Marriage
of the Virgin."

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:10%
We see Mary with Joseph.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And in the background, we see
the domed Solomon's Temple,

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.785 align:middle line:10%
this time with a polygonal base.

00:09:32.785 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:10%
And here is that polygonal
base with the domed roof.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:10%
So did Solomon's Temple,
in fact, have a dome?

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And is this, in
part, the inspiration

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:10%
for putting a dome
on the US Capitol?

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:10%
Did the Masons, who
conceived of Solomon's Temple

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:10%
as their lodge, also
conceive of the US Capitol

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:10%
as a new Temple of
Solomon-- in fact,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:10%
the third Temple of Solomon?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:10%
It's important for us here to
recognize the Dome of the Rock

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:10%
in Jerusalem, which occupies
the site of Solomon's Temple.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:10%
The Dome conceals
what is considered

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:10%
to be the most sacred rock and
dot of real estate on earth.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.189 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
Foundation Stone,

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:10%
and is said to have
been planted here

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:10%
at the beginning of
creation and taken

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:10%
by God from his Throne of Glory.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.380 align:middle line:10%
Jews, of course, see this
as the center of the Earth

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:10%
and the axis of the universe.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:10%
The ladder, or
stairway to heaven,

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:10%
the pivot that joins
Heaven and Earth.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:10%
And underneath
the dome, is where

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:10%
we see the Foundation Stone.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the location,
of course, of where

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
was taken by Moses.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock
was built between 687 and 691 AD

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:10%
and is considered
hallowed ground.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:10%
Jews venerate it as the site
where Solomon's Temple once

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:10%
stood.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:10%
It's an octagonal platform
with a dome on top.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:10%
And this place is considered
an X place, or a portal,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.560 align:middle line:10%
leading into the
heavenly realms.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it was
from this location,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:10%
which is now marked by
this gateway symbolism,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:10%
that Muhammad ascended
into the heavens

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:10%
on his magic horse, el
Buraq, locating this

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:10%
as a sacred site for not
just Jews and Christians,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:10%
but also for Muslims, as well.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Now coming back to
the Capitol, we're

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
going to look at how
that dome was actually

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:90%
placed on top of the Capitol.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It happened when Abraham Lincoln
took office in March, 1861.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
At that time, America
was on the verge

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
of a bloody Civil War that would
have devastating consequences

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
for the first term of Lincoln's
term-- administration.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It was Lincoln who
was destined to put

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
the Solomonic dome
on the Capitol.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:10%
In fact, on the Capitol
lawn at Lincoln's inaugural,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:10%
visitors could see the model
of the Statue of Freedom,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:10%
the Goddess Freedom,
that was destined

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.215 align:middle line:10%
for the top of the Capitol.

00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:10%


00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Here we're looking at Thomas
Ustick Walter's watercolor,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:10%
his visualization of the dome.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:10%
When Congress saw
this watercolor,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:10%
they instantly
funded construction

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:10%
of what was called
the New High Dome.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:10%
And as the
construction unfolded,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:10%
a question began to emerge
in the minds of visitors

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:10%
and everyone in Washington.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was, what
would be painted

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
on the interior, or the
oculus of that dome?

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And here we see
Walter's rendering

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of a possible vision of
what he would see in there.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:10%
We see Freedom, who is also
destined to top that dome.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:10%
Freedom being the
Goddess of America.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was is that
some, as the Civil War began

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:10%
and people began to die and
blood was being spilled,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:10%
some urged Lincoln to
devote the Capitol building

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:10%
funds to the war effort.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Lincoln, however, insisted on
continuing the construction

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:10%
of the New High Dome
as a symbol of the hope

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:10%
for the future of the Union.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:10%
And so here we see this
painting from inside

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:10%
the Congressional
side of the Capitol,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:10%
of Lincoln posing,
almost like a magician.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine him willing
to raise that high dome.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And with it, to raise America's
future and to take us forward.

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Here is the plan of
the dome from 1863,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:10%
also by Philadelphia architect
Thomas Ustick Walter.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:10%
And here is where we
get this correspondence

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:10%
with Solomon's Temple.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:10%
Because look what
we see here, is,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:10%
we have this octagonal platform
upon which the dome would sit.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:10%
Now what we're
going to do here is

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:10%
we're going to compare a line
drawing of the octagonal plan

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:10%
of the Dome of the Rock
in Jerusalem, where

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:10%
we see the octagonal plan with
the sacred rock, the Foundation

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:10%
Stone, in the center.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Now let's compare
the line drawing

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Dome of the
Rock with this drawing

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
by Walter of the New High Dome.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that they're
virtually identical, if not

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%
interchangeable drawings.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what we
can do is we can

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
take the plan of
the Dome of the Rock

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and superimpose it over the
plan of the New High Dome,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
and we have a new perfect match.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So here, what we're looking
at is a Masonic interpretation

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:84%
of the US Capitol, not just as
a Masonic lodge, but also as

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
a rebuilding of
Solomon's Temple.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Is the US Capitol, in fact,
the rebuilt Solomon's Temple,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.180 align:middle line:10%
the third Temple of Solomon?

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.550 align:middle line:10%
It's a very
controversial question,

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:10%
but one that is certainly
enjoyed by Masons.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:10%
So here, we're
looking at photographs

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:10%
of the rising of
the New High Dome.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:10%
And we see it rising
in majesty, here,

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:10%
as they're preparing now to
put the cupola on the dome.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It continues to rise until,
in 1864, 1865, finally

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.090 align:middle line:90%
it's completed.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have the Statue
of Freedom placed on top.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Inside the dome, of course,
is the Capitol Rotunda,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
which is a large,
circular room that's

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
located in the center of the
Capitol on the second floor.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's 96 feet in diameter,
so it's quite a large room.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the symbolic and physical
heart of the US Capitol.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It's also the ceremonial
center of the United States

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:84%
In this extraordinary
room, magnificent room,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
is where powerful American
ceremonies take place.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of ritual.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And here, we're looking
into the entrance

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
way used by congressmen
and senators.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
The beam of light is
actually headed towards,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
or beaming towards the
center of the Rotunda.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of the
Rotunda is this gold dot.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
become very important later

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in our exploration, so
make a note of that.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in
fact, me standing

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
on that gold dot in
the center the Rotunda,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
looking up into the
oculus, or eye of the dome.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, looking now
from the top-down view.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
We're in a high in the dome
now, and we're looking down

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
into the Rotunda, where
we see the gold dot

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
in the center and
the various paintings

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and statuary that
inhabit the Rotunda,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:90%
the gold dot in the center.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Now we're even higher
up into the dome,

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's starting to
appear in our imagination,

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
almost like this place
is a gateway, of sorts.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to see this place actually is.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And now we're finally
high up in the dome,

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
looking down into the Rotunda

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
More directly, the
Rotunda, as I noted,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:90%
is a place of American ritual.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:10%
Rites are performed
here; statues,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:10%
such as one of Washington
and Jefferson and present day

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:10%
Ronald Reagan,
are unveiled here.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Inaugurations used
to take place here.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Eminent citizens lay in
state in this Rotunda.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was the assassinated
body of honest Abraham Lincoln,

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
the first President
to be assassinated,

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
which has forever
hallowed this spot.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite a
poignant recognition

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:10%
to realize that it was Lincoln
who willed this high dome

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:10%
to be constructed, not knowing
that his assassinated body

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:10%
would soon lay in
state in this place,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:10%
making it sacred ground
for all Americans.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And here is a diagram,
or a painting rather,

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of Abraham Lincoln laying
in state in the Rotunda.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
What would happen is visitors
would file along Pennsylvania

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Avenue and then come
into the Capitol

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and then make a circle
around the President

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:84%
as he lay in state
in the Rotunda.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Crossing cultures, let's
talk about the dome here

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and its significance.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:90%
The dome is a cosmic symbol.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent to the
stupa of India and China.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
A stupa is a Sanskrit
word that means heap.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a mound-like structure
containing Buddhist relics.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And its hemispheric shape
represents the world egg

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:90%
and the womb.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Domes, of course, are feminine.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're considered to be
gateways into other worlds,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps other dimensions.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, is
that in Buddhism, the relics

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
are placed inside the
stupa and they symbolize

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:84%
the seed of life, or
the seed of rebirth.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a very key idea
here as we begin

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to interpret the US
Capitol dome as a temple.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Later, the stupa became a symbol
of the Buddha's final release

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:84%
from the cycle of
birth and rebirth.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Now let's think
about this in terms

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of what happens when we lay our
deceased presidents in state

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
in the center of the Rotunda,
in the center of this stupa.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The stupa and dome
actually create a spiral,

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
or a vortex of energy, that
spins around a central axis.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're in
a Buddhist temple

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:84%
or in the US Capitol
Temple, we're

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:84%
actually in a vortex created
by the design of the dome.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.180 align:middle line:10%
This is the
intention of the dome

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:10%
is to create this spiraling
vortex or axis of energy that

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:10%
assists, actually, in
the rebirth of those

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:10%
who are placed in the Rotunda.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Actually, we can get a real
clear sense of this vortex idea

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:34.510 align:middle line:10%
when they rebuilt the Reichstag
Dome in Berlin after World War

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:10%
II.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:10%
They placed this dome over
the Reichstag building.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:10%
And what we see here is this
architectural feature actually

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:10%
includes, or features,
highlights a spiraling vortex

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:10%
inside.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to imagine that this
is exactly what is happening

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:84%
inside the dome
of the US Capitol

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.254 align:middle line:84%
when we're standing
on that gold dot.

00:19:57.254 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is why they
don't let you stand on

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
that gold dot in the
dome of the US Capitol.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll see
later, I've actually

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
done that and experienced
this vortex of energy

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
inside the dome
of the US Capitol.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So very interesting
insight here.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're actually
looking at here

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
is Gerald Ford, President
Gerald Ford's body

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:84%
laying in state in the
Rotunda of the Capitol.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Look at that view
of this vortex.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me,
by looking at that,

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that you're not getting an
idea that this place is,

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
in fact, designed as
a portal or a gateway.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, just imagine
the effect-- now

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
we're looking down here at,
actually, at President Ronald

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Reagan's body laying in state.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We see people entering
into the Rotunda.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And what do they do when
they come into the Rotunda?

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.516 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is, is that
they actually circumnavigate,

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
or nabulate the body
laying in state.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:90%
They're in a vortex.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The body is laying
in the center,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:84%
on the gold dot in the center
of this axis of energy.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And what do people
do as they walk by?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They direct prayer energy at the
body of the deceased president.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Now what kind of
effect would you

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:84%
suppose that might
have on the spirit

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
or soul of the president?

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
They have to imagine
that they are actually

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
infusing their spirit or soul
with this powerful prayer

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:90%
energy in this vortex.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can almost imagine
that if the soul is still

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
close to the body, that then,
it is then actually ascending

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
through this cosmic
spiral, or gateway.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Here's a key thing
about the Capitol

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and the dome and the
stupa, is that the dome

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:10%
symbolizes the cranium.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:10%
Dome, of course, is
slang for the head.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:10%
So in fact, the dome
of the US Capitol

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:10%
is actually symbolic of our own
dome, our own consciousness.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the object of all arcanum
is to trigger the latent

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
capabilities within
our consciousness

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and transform us into
free, or sovereign beings.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So lo and behold, the
dome of the US Capitol

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:84%
actually encodes this
entire process in stone,

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:90%
for those with eyes to see.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And the key thing here is
that, again, the US Capitol

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
is a temple that was
conceived as the temple

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of celestial liberty, the temple
where free and sovereign beings

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
could learn the
process of ascension,

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and even resurrection.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is me, inside the
capitol visitor center,

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
standing in the dome, pointing
at the painting in the oculus,

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
now, of the dome,
"The Apotheosis

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:90%
of George Washington."

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that
what we have here

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
incredible temple structures

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.840 align:middle line:84%
conceived anywhere
at any time on Earth.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's take a look at
the painting in the oculus,

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
or eye of the dome, "The
Apotheosis of George

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Washington."

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The painter is
Constantino Brumidi,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:84%
who came from Italy
in the early 1840s.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And Clare is going to
talk with us, momentarily,

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:84%
in detail about
Constantino Brumidi

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and how he came to
conceive this painting.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And what it meaned
to him and, possibly,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.312 align:middle line:84%
his intention behind creating
"The Apotheosis of Washington."

00:23:23.312 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:10%
What we're actually
looking at here

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:10%
is one of Brumidi's studies for
"The Apotheosis of Washington."

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:10%
That word, apotheosis,
it's very important, very,

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:10%
very insightful.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It means to deify, to raise
from a man to a god-man.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Or to transform a ordinary
human into a divine being.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And so Brumidi's given,
basically, free reign

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to paint anything he wants in
the oculus, or eye of the dome,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
after it's completed in 1865.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:90%
What does he paint?

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
He shows us
Washington surrounded

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:90%
by divine or celestial beings.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:90%
He's ascended into the heavens.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And what Brumidi does is he
includes the arching rainbow

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:10%
to indicate that Washington has
achieved the ascended state.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi actually prepared
this study of "The Apotheosis"

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:10%
for Thomas Ustick Walter,
the architect of the Capitol,

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:10%
who liked it enough that he
took it to his Germantown home

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:10%
in his residence
in Philadelphia.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So as we continue
here, we actually

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:10%
are going to recognize that
Washington is under the rainbow

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:10%
and surrounded by
celestial or star beings.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi actually did a second
study for "The Apotheosis."

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The second study had been
lost for a long time,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
until it was finally
recovered in 2012,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and is now in the Smithsonian
in Washington, DC.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is the second study for
"The Apotheosis of Washington."

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
This time, Washington is not
under the rainbow, he's on it.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Now this is extraordinary,
because Brumidi is delivering

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
a very clear message here: that
Washington is not just a man,

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:90%
he is now a deified being.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in his description,
in Brumidi's own description

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of this painting, he
describes Washington not as

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
the father of the United
States, but rather

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.100 align:middle line:90%
the Savior of America.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:30.510 align:middle line:10%
Major distinction, clearly
putting a layer of religiosity

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:10%
onto Washington.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.510 align:middle line:10%
He also puts, intriguingly, 72
stars around the apotheosis,

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:10%
creating a gate, a stargate
in which this painting would

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:10%
be viewed.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
72 is one of the most
important numbers in all

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric
numerology, symbolizing

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
not only the number of
degrees in astrology,

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
but also the number
of the names of God,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and also the number of the
djinn, or the demon spirits

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
that Solomon was said to have
controlled with his ring,

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
fashioned from the
Chintamani Stone, by the way.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:10%
So what we see
here is Washington

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.430 align:middle line:10%
on the rainbow, still
surrounded by the celestial,

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.871 align:middle line:10%
or the star beings.

00:26:16.871 --> 00:26:18.870 align:middle line:84%
We know they're celestial
beings because they've

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:90%
got stars on their heads.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And also, this is
a heavenly scene.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not an earthly scene.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you take
a tour of the Capitol,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.560 align:middle line:84%
the Capitol guides
will try to tell you

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that these 13 maidens that
surround Washington symbolize

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:90%
the 13 original colonies.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, but that can't be because
we're not on Earth, guys.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:90%
We're in a celestial realm.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
We're in the heavenly realm.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So what do these 13
maidens symbolize?

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.235 align:middle line:84%
We'll answer that
question, momentarily.

00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Just for now, we're
familiarizing ourselves

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
with the iconography of "The
Apotheosis of Washington"

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that Constantino
Brumidi is showing Washington

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.405 align:middle line:84%
as a divine being, the
savior of the country.

00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:84%
In his final rendering,
which is what we see today

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in the oculus of
the dome, we see

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:84%
this magnificent painting,
full-blown, come to life.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing now
is we're in the Rotunda.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We're looking up
into the dome, and we

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
see the 72 stars forming
the stargate surrounding

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.000 align:middle line:90%
"The Apotheosis of Washington."

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi has made a couple of
modifications to his fresco,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
here, that become
very important to us

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:90%
as we decode this painting.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue, we're
going to pull back the layers

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and reveal the incredible
message that Brumidi

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.320 align:middle line:84%
has encoded within
this painting.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So for now, let's
just zero in on this

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and take a moment to
more greatly familiarize

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
ourself with what
we're seeing here.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So here, as we are spinning
around the painting,

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:84%
looking at it from different
views, what we're going to see,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, is
Washington enthroned

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
on the rainbow with Fame and
Liberty on either side of him.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And here, again,
are the 13 maidens,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:84%
now again with the
stars on their heads.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:84%
These are celestial, or star
beings, that surround him.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:90%
But why only 13?

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Hm!

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll come but back, again,
to that in just a moment.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And as we tour around the
painting, and in the detail,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
we see Washington with
this purple robe on.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We see Fame blowing a trumpet,
indicating a sound or vibration

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:90%
is present.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And we see Liberty
holding the fasces,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:90%
wearing her liberty cap.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.750 align:middle line:84%
These are the
goddesses of America.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And most people
today don't realize

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that the number
of goddesses that

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:84%
are present in early American
iconography, not only

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is there Liberty and
Fame and Freedom,

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a
goddess named America

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
who's on the east
entrance to the Capitol.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.500 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
She's wearing a cloak of
stars and a star crown.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.360 align:middle line:84%
She's another one of the
celestial beings that

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.895 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be
divinely guiding America.

00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
What we notice
behind Washington is

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the open sun gate, or star
tunnel, behind him, as well.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Here in the detail, we see
the 13 maidens, the 13 star

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:90%
maidens.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And we notice that they're
holding a banner in their hand.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
It reads "E pluribus
unum," out of many, one.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Washington is directly
connected with the rainbow

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:90%
in early American art.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about this for a moment

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:84%
because it's something
that's typically not

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.240 align:middle line:84%
observed by historians and
mostly unknown to Americans.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a painting
by Gilbert Stuart.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Dolly Madison rescued
this famous painting

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.210 align:middle line:84%
when the British burned
the White House in 1812.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
What we notice is Washington
is standing beside a table.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
The table actually
has a leg that

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:84%
is a caduceus, the
symbol of arcanum.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But behind him, strangely,
is this arching rainbow.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Why the rainbow
behind Washington?

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:84%
It's unexplained by Gilbert
Stuart and, as I noted,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:90%
often unobserved.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Why, once again, is
Washington connected

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
with the symbolism
of the rainbow?

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:10%
What are these
artists and painters

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:10%
trying to convey
with this symbolism?

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at this example here.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.620 align:middle line:10%
This is "Washington as
a Freemason" from 1866.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.200 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this here,
where we have Washington,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.860 align:middle line:10%
in full Masonic regalia,
standing on a Masonic matrix.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a ladder,
which is actually

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.055 align:middle line:84%
Jacob's Ladder, extending
from his shoulder.

00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
On the ladder are
written the letters F,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
H, and C, which symbolize
faith, hope, and charity.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's, by far, not
the most interesting aspect

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.020 align:middle line:90%
of this painting.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.000 align:middle line:84%
As we follow the ladder emerging
from Washington's shoulder,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we see faith, hope, and
charity, and then we

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
see this strange rainbow
burst coming out of the sky.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, some would
take a look at that

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, that's got to
be a UFO that's present there.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That's actually not a UFO.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
here is a rainbow rip

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:90%
in the fabric of space-time.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But even more beyond
that, I'm going

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to propose to you that
what this represents

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is Washington's
ascension into what we're

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:84%
going to describe here
as a rainbow-body being.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to
see as we continue

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is that Washington was eulogized
as Enoch, the translated man

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
whose body was dissolved
into rainbow colored light

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and then taken into heaven
by the archangel Michael.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's
exactly what this rainbow

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
burst symbolizes, is
Washington's transformation

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:84%
from a man into a divine being,
just as happened with Enoch.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And while it may seem arcane,
the Apotheosis of Washington

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
was a popular
theme among artists

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:84%
after Washington's death
and until the Civil War.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that, for
a period of about 60 years,

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
it was widely believed that
George Washington ascended

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.450 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens, just like
Enoch, just like Jesus.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an extraordinary
statement to make.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
made by these artists

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.089 align:middle line:84%
and reflects a
commonly held belief

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:84%
after the founding of
America and after the death

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
of Washington, all the way
up the time of the Civil War.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
we've completely lost.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And if I may express
a personal view here,

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe we need to
get back to these roots,

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that the Founding
Fathers imagined America

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.030 align:middle line:84%
as not just a physical space,
but also a psychological space

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.030 align:middle line:84%
where individuals
would be free to attain

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate human
manifestation,

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
our transformation or
ascension into light beings.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:10%
And this explains why
Washington was directly

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:10%
connected, not just with
Enoch, but as we'll see,

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:10%
directly connected and equated
with Christ as an ascended

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:10%
being.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.150 align:middle line:10%
What we're looking at
here is an engraving

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:10%
by JJ Barralet around 1800.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:10%
It's based on a sermon
delivered by Simon Chaudron

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:10%
after Washington's death,
equating Washington to Enoch.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Now we explored this in an
early "Arcanum" episode,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:10%
that Enoch is considered to be
the same as Thoth or Hermes,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:10%
the God of Arcanum.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Are they trying to
say that Washington

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:90%
is a reincarnation of Enoch?

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Or that he was simply like
Enoch in his ascension?

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a bold statement that
this artist is making, again,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:90%
based on this sermon.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:05.430 align:middle line:10%
Washington is shown here
raised-- like Enoch and Jesus--

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.179 align:middle line:10%
from the tomb upon
a shaft of light

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.420 align:middle line:10%
by spiritual and
temporal beings.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.370 align:middle line:10%
In this case, Genius
and also Immortality.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:10%
So here we see Washington
being lifted up

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:10%
by these divine
celestial beings,

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:26.159 align:middle line:10%
being raised into the heavens
on a shaft, or beam, of light.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The Bible tells us that flesh
and blood cannot inhabit

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
or inherit the
Kingdom of Heaven.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.790 align:middle line:84%
What this means
is that Washington

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:84%
must have been transformed
in this belief system.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
He is no longer a
flesh and blood man.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he has now
somehow been translated--

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is the term they use
in the book of Enoch--

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.850 align:middle line:84%
or transformed
into a light being.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.199 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible story.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:10%
Here is "The Apotheosis
of Washington."

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.470 align:middle line:10%
It's by David Edwin.

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:10%
It's after the
famous Philadelphia

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:10%
artist, Rembrandt Peale.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:10%
We see Washington being, once
again, lifted into the heavens,

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:10%
ascending into the heavens on
a beam, or shaft, of light,

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.670 align:middle line:10%
being assisted by
celestial beings.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:10%
An angel places a
wreath of immortality

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:10%
on Washington's head.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Why do you do this
unless you believe

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:84%
this is what happened
to Washington?

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's
totally sacrilegious.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
To equate Washington
with Christ?

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:84%
They must have had a deep
sense that Washington

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.760 align:middle line:84%
had this profound spiritual
transformation, or translation,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:90%
into a celestial being.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:10%
This image here, "The
Apotheosis of George Washington"

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.490 align:middle line:10%
is from around 1860.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.692 align:middle line:10%
It's by H. Weishaupt
and Samuel Moore.

00:35:49.692 --> 00:35:51.400 align:middle line:10%
It's presently in the
Metropolitan Museum

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:10%
of Art in New York City.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.810 align:middle line:10%
It's where we see
Washington, once again,

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:01.120 align:middle line:10%
being lifted into the heavens by
celestial beings, divine beings

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:10%
with stars on their
heads, indicating

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:10%
they are star beings.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Now there's no other
way to interpret this,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:84%
except that we're
talking about the belief,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
here, that Washington was
translated into heaven

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.890 align:middle line:90%
by celestial beings.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.910 align:middle line:84%
It goes to this idea
that, in fact, Washington

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:84%
was more than just
an ordinary man.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about an
extraordinary soul, here, who

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.240 align:middle line:84%
created or led in the formation
and foundation of a nation

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to the enlightenment
of the individual.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, I propose
is what the Founding

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Fathers intended for all
Americans to experience:

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.460 align:middle line:84%
to come to this place
where they would have

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:84%
the psychological freedom,
for the first time

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:49.210 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:84%
There's no pope,
there's no priest,

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.900 align:middle line:84%
there's no politician or
pimp all over their back,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:84%
telling them what they
can and cannot do.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Instead, if they
choose, Americans

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:84%
can follow the
path of Washington

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and achieve this translation,
or transformation,

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:90%
into a celestial being.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.860 align:middle line:10%
This image here is
"The Last Judgment."

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:10%
It's from 1850.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:10%
It's by Rembrandt
Lockwood in the Newark

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:10%
Museum in New Jersey.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.690 align:middle line:10%
What do we see?

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:10%
We see George
Washington, once again,

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:24.540 align:middle line:10%
being lifted into the
heavens by a celestial being.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So did, in fact, an
angel or a star being

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:84%
manifest before or shortly
after the death of Washington

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and lift George Washington
into the heavens,

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
placing him beside Christ
on the Heavenly throne?

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary concept
to wrap our heads around,

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:84%
but the artwork is clear that
this was going reigning belief

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:84%
from the time of Washington's
death up until the Civil War.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
find other examples

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of Washington's ascension
in the US Capitol.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:10%
This is the "Car of History."

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:10%
It's by Carlo Franzoni.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:10%
It's in Statuary Hall
of the US Capitol.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.760 align:middle line:10%
We see Clio riding upon
her winged chariot.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:10%
In Jewish mysticism,
this is referred to

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:10%
as the Merkabah vehicle.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the winged
chariot, or the car

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.030 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, that
represents a, sort of,

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
immortality vehicle
through which we're

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:90%
able to travel the cosmos.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.230 align:middle line:84%
We see the clock here, as the
guides will often point out.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:84%
We see Clio up
here with the book.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But what they often
overlook is the fact

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that we see George
Washington's face

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
on the front of this
"Car of History."

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Now in my mind, the
only way to read this

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is that this is George
Washington's Merkabah vehicle.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It goes to this mystic
idea, once again,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:84%
that Washington is an
immortal being now,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
traveling the stars as a
divine or celestial being.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.380 align:middle line:10%
And here we note, once
again, the presence

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:10%
of the angel, the presence of
the sound or vibration that

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.740 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps empowering
Washington's star

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:10%
vehicle, his Merkabah.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:10%
All the way up until
1865, we had this belief.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:10%
And we finally get
to this postcard

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.420 align:middle line:10%
that was a popular
item, actually,

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.770 align:middle line:10%
at the funeral of
Abraham Lincoln.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a fine carte de visite
of the Apotheosis of Lincoln.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:10%
Now we have the belief
that Lincoln also

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:10%
ascended into the
heavens, where he

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:36.810 align:middle line:10%
was greeted, not by Christ, but
rather by George Washington.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Now this is absolutely
extraordinary

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to think that Lincoln was
also drawn into the heavens

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.460 align:middle line:84%
by a celestial being, this
time George Washington.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:10%
This is a detail from a larger
image, an engraving that

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:10%
has angels in the
sky to the left.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:10%
And it's from my
private collection.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:10%
So what we're left with
here is this belief

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.290 align:middle line:10%
and this artistic expression
that George Washington,

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:10%
like Enoch, like
Thoth, like Osiris,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:10%
like Christ ascended
into the heavens,

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.715 align:middle line:10%
where he dwells as an
immortal and celestial being.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that's an
extraordinary thought.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a special
surprise for you, now.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.950 align:middle line:84%
In the conclusion of
this part of "Arcanum,"

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to offer you a
guided tour of the US Capitol.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
It's one that I did
several years ago,

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:35.100 align:middle line:84%
when you were allowed,
actually, to enter

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
the Temple of Celestial Liberty
and wander around, basically,

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:90%
at will.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Ever since 9/11,
there's been a bit

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
of a clamp-down on the
average individual's ability

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.311 align:middle line:84%
to wander the Peoples Temple,
as the Capitol is also called.

00:40:49.311 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
show you is something

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that probably will not
be able to be duplicated

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.410 align:middle line:84%
any time in the near future,
what with the security

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
precautions now in
place in the Capitol.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:10%
So for the next few
minutes, let's enjoy,

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:10%
together, my personal tour
of the Peoples Temple,

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.815 align:middle line:10%
the Temple of Celestial Liberty.

00:41:09.815 --> 00:41:12.214 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.214 --> 00:41:12.880 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We're standing on the east side
of the United States Capitol.

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.246 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
know the United States

00:41:17.246 --> 00:41:18.619 align:middle line:90%
Capitol is a temple.

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It was conceived
by Thomas Jefferson

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:22.970 align:middle line:90%
as a temple of sovereignty.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
There were poems
written, in 1793,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
describing it as the Temple
of Celestial Liberty.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:90%
The Temple of Celestial Liberty?

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Is this a stargate?

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:32.820 align:middle line:90%
Is this a star temple?

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.824 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is.

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we go
inside, we're going

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to see the example of a
deified being floating

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
in the dome of the Rotunda.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That deity is George
Washington, who

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.880 align:middle line:84%
is portrayed on a rainbow
in a heavenly scene.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.962 align:middle line:84%
So let's go inside
and find the real lost

00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:90%
secrets in this temple.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.385 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.385 --> 00:41:56.635 align:middle line:84%
We're in one of the most
special places in the Capitol

00:41:56.635 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that few visitors actually
get to visit anymore.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.737 align:middle line:84%
This is the tomb of
George Washington.

00:42:01.737 --> 00:42:04.070 align:middle line:84%
This was the place where
George Washington and his wife,

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.025 align:middle line:84%
Martha, were originally
going to be buried.

00:42:06.025 --> 00:42:10.140 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see,
Washington's Tomb is empty.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Historically, we know that
he's buried at Mount Vernon.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.176 align:middle line:84%
There was a trust
issue with his estate.

00:42:15.176 --> 00:42:17.550 align:middle line:84%
However, when we look at the
Capitol from the perspective

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that it's a portal,
or a gateway,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Washington's Tomb plays
a very interesting role.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Washington's Tomb is
empty because, actually,

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.896 align:middle line:84%
George Washington is on
the ceiling of the Rotunda.

00:42:29.896 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:84%
He is portrayed as
a heavenly being.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:84%
He is portrayed as having
ascended, risen from the tomb,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:90%
just like in the story of Jesus.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Now when we're in the tomb
here, what we're looking at

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is the catafalque upon
which the sarcophagus of all

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:84%
of the dead presidents
has been laid.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.010 align:middle line:84%
The United States Capitol has
been considered hallowed ground

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.150 align:middle line:84%
ever since Abraham Lincoln's
assassinated body laid

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:56.440 align:middle line:84%
in state in the Rotunda on
the catafalque that is now

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:84%
on display in the
Capitol Visitor's Center.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about this is

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.160 align:middle line:84%
that, when we look up at
"The Apotheosis of George

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Washington" and draw
a direct vertical line

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.854 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, the open sun
gate behind Washington,

00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and we go down straight through
the gold dot in the center

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Rotunda, straight through
the white star in the center

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.600 align:middle line:84%
of the crypt, one story beneath
it, directly beneath it,

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.280 align:middle line:90%
is this tomb of Washington.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Leading some of us, including
myself as a researcher,

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to wonder: is this some
sort of a mystery initiation

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.306 align:middle line:84%
that could be
enacted in this room?

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Is this sort of like
the King's Chamber

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid,
which is also empty?

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.890 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt,
the Pharaoh would

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
lay in the sarcophagus
in the King's Chamber

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and would visualize himself
traveling out of the pyramid,

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:84%
into the stars, into
the heavenly realms.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can just imagine the
Masonic rituals being performed

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.970 align:middle line:84%
in this Masonic lodge, because
that's what the Capitol is.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It is literally a lodge.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize
them in this room,

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.140 align:middle line:84%
attuning themselves
with the heavenly realms

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and visualizing
themselves traveling

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:84%
through the white
star, one story

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:05.260 align:middle line:84%
above, through the gold
dot, one story above that,

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and then, up
through the sun gate

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.625 align:middle line:84%
in "The Apotheosis of
George Washington."

00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We're in the crypt of the
United States Capitol.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.530 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about this is
that this is a civic building.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Civic buildings
don't have crypts.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Temples have crypts,
churches have crypts,

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.920 align:middle line:90%
cathedrals have crypts.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.920 align:middle line:90%
But this building has a crypt.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the United States
Capitol is actually a temple.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.670 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Jefferson called it
the Temple of Sovereignty.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:10%
When it was built,
there were poems

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:10%
written calling it the
Temple of Celestial Liberty.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:10%
So this makes the crypt
a very important room.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:10%
It's one story above
Washington's Tomb and one

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:10%
below the Rotunda.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.370 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the crypt, we're
seeing 40 magnificent stone

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.800 align:middle line:84%
pillars that are modeled
after the Temple of Poseidon

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.502 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Athens.

00:44:54.502 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the Temple
of Poseidon is so important

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.210 align:middle line:84%
is because the
Founding Fathers were

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.530 align:middle line:84%
members of the Rosicrucians
and the Freemasons,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.120 align:middle line:84%
secret societies that
believed that America

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:90%
was the new Atlantis.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Poseidon was the priest king
of the original Atlantis.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So by building the
crypt in the model

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of
Poseidon, they're

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.850 align:middle line:84%
paying homage to the original
priest king, or founder,

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
When we go into this Temple of
Poseidon, at the very center,

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:84%
at the very center of Washington
is this amazing white star.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It is called the
Seed of Washington.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.460 align:middle line:84%
All the mile markers
for Washington, DC

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
are measured relative to
this Seed of Washington.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful symbol.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we stand on
it, we are experiencing

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:90%
this amazing acoustic effect.

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:84%
My voice is literally
reverberating off the columns,

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and I hear an echo
inside my head.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.960 align:middle line:84%
If I were to go right straight
through this chandelier,

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:84%
through the ceiling, I
would be in the Rotunda

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Capital,
one story above me.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Just above that is
the open sun gate

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.620 align:middle line:84%
in "The Apotheosis of
George Washington."

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:05.875 align:middle line:84%
So standing on the crypt
here is a very powerful spot.

00:46:05.875 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the
most special place,

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.730 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, in all of
America, maybe even

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:84%
the whole world, the Rotunda
of the United States Capitol.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Right here is to gold dot in
the center of the Rotunda.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, when I
stand on this, my voice

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:90%
is amplified 5 or 10 times.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I hear it in my head,
and it's reverberating

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:29.850 align:middle line:84%
all around this dome
and inside my own dome.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, one story beneath
us is the white star

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.070 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the crypt.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.910 align:middle line:84%
One story beneath that
is Washington's Tomb.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And here we are now, on
this gold dot, looking up

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.770 align:middle line:84%
at George Washington, the
Founding Father of America,

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.010 align:middle line:84%
as an ascended
being on the rainbow

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.410 align:middle line:90%
in front of the sun gate.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.890 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
Washington's Tomb is empty

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.470 align:middle line:90%
is because he is risen.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:90%
He is in the heavenly realms.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.160 align:middle line:84%
He's gone through the stargate,
the circle of stars, the 72

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.180 align:middle line:84%
stars that surrounds "The
Apotheosis of Washington,"

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and is beckoning us to join him,
actually inviting us to receive

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
the blessing of America,
of true freedom,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:84%
of liberty, that
is bestowed upon us

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.040 align:middle line:90%
and is inherent in this place.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Now what I like to do
is to lay on my back

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and just look up at
George Washington

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:23.330 align:middle line:84%
in this magnificent building and
allow the energy of this dome,

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of this stargate, to literally
just fill my consciousness.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:84%
George Washington is not
alone when we look up there.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:31.390 align:middle line:90%
He has goddesses around him.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:33.930 align:middle line:84%
He has 13 star maidens
that surround him.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.760 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that,
he's got five gods.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.920 align:middle line:84%
The five gods of alchemy,
of earth, air, fire, water,

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and space-time surround him.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And what Constantino
Brumidi, the painter who

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.790 align:middle line:84%
painted this magnificent
painting, tells

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.010 align:middle line:84%
us is that the way that
we become a risen being

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is to harness the
power of those elements

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:84%
within us, to balance
those elements.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, by then doing
so, we can literally

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.670 align:middle line:84%
to achieve this
transformative consciousness

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that's embodied here
by George Washington.

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:04.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning experience
to sit here and just allow

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:84%
this place to seep into you and
recognize how truly free we are

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and how fortunate we are to be
able to live in a country that

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.400 align:middle line:90%
allows these freedoms.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to sit here
and concentrate and focus

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and meditate on the
energy of this place

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.227 align:middle line:84%
and visualize myself, just
like George Washington, rising

00:48:22.227 --> 00:48:24.310 align:middle line:84%
through that gateway right
up through the sun gate

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:25.351 align:middle line:90%
into the heavenly realms.

00:48:25.351 --> 00:48:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.120 align:middle line:84%
In Dan Brown's book,
The Lost Symbol,

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:84%
he introduces us to the
concept of noetics, the idea

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.770 align:middle line:84%
that people can focus their
energy or their intention

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
on a specific spot
to affect change.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if,
three times a day,

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Americans turned towards
the US Capitol dome

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and sent positive
energy or intentions,

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.970 align:middle line:84%
that we could bring
about dramatic change.

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.550 align:middle line:90%
This isn't hocus-pocus.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:54.820 align:middle line:90%
This is new science.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.360 align:middle line:84%
This is actual solid fact
about how we can affect change.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.839 align:middle line:90%

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.180 align:middle line:10%
And now, in this segment
of "Beyond the Veil,"

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.060 align:middle line:10%
Clare is going to take us closer
to the mysteries of the divine

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.780 align:middle line:10%
spark through the eyes
of the great Renaissance

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:10%
master, Sandro Botticelli.

>> CLARE: Did
Constantino Brumidi,

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:23.660 align:middle line:84%
a former Vatican painter,
encode the secrets of ascension

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.895 align:middle line:90%
in the dome of the US Capitol?

00:49:25.895 --> 00:49:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Did he do so to settle an
old score with the Vatican?

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
In this segment of "Beyond
the Veil," we'll find out.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:45.810 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Born in Rome on July the 26,
1805, Constantino Brumidi

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.200 align:middle line:84%
began his study of
art at the age of 13,

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.760 align:middle line:84%
when he was accepted at the
acclaimed Accademia di San

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Luca.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.950 align:middle line:84%
He spent the early years
of his artistic life

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:84%
in the most powerful
and prestigious center

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.820 align:middle line:90%
of artistic patronage in Rome.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.930 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the 1840s, Brumidi
painted extensively in Rome,

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:23.410 align:middle line:10%
moving from one prestigious
Vatican project to another.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.470 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi's classical
training in Rome

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:10%
gave him a thorough
understanding

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Roman Renaissance
and Baroque styles, symbols,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and techniques of oil painting.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
He restored the works
of Raphael, the greatest

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.120 align:middle line:90%
painter of the High Renaissance.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.450 align:middle line:10%
Raphael's style was imprinted
on Brumidi's imagination

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.270 align:middle line:10%
and would later play
an important role

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.220 align:middle line:10%
in Brumidi's masterpiece.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.170 align:middle line:10%
The four Raphael rooms in
the Palace of the Vatican

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:02.410 align:middle line:10%
form a suite of reception rooms,
the public part of the Papal

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Apartments.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:10%
They are famous for
their frescoes painted

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:11.110 align:middle line:10%
by Raphael and those
in the workshop.

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Then destiny intervened.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:19.620 align:middle line:10%
In 1848, Brumidi found
himself on the wrong side

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.670 align:middle line:10%
of the Revolution in Rome.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:27.180 align:middle line:10%
He was falsely accused and found
guilty by the Vatican Court

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.310 align:middle line:10%
and sentenced to
18 years in prison.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:31.880 align:middle line:10%


00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.900 align:middle line:10%
Seeing a new
Raphael, the Jesuits

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:39.440 align:middle line:10%
intervened-- a religious
society formed in 1559

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.880 align:middle line:10%
by the Spaniard,
Ignatius Loyola, who

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.830 align:middle line:10%
had a mystical vision of Christ.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Some call the Jesuits the
Pope's private militia

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and the most learned
in matters of arcanum.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.550 align:middle line:10%
The Jesuits made a
deal with the Vatican

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.260 align:middle line:10%
that enabled Brumidi to
come to the United States

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.770 align:middle line:10%
to paint churches
in New York City.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:09.590 align:middle line:10%
The Pope agreed, but
only on the condition

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:15.310 align:middle line:10%
that Brumidi's wife and
children remain in Rome.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.220 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi stayed in New
York for a short time.

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.570 align:middle line:84%
His destiny to paint
his masterpiece

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:24.720 align:middle line:84%
in the dome of the US
Capitol was calling.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.655 align:middle line:84%
He aimed to outdo
the great Raphael.

00:52:27.655 --> 00:52:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.450 align:middle line:84%
When Brumidi arrived
at the Capitol,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.580 align:middle line:84%
he must have immediately
seen a resemblance

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.825 align:middle line:90%
to his former workspace.

00:52:36.825 --> 00:52:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
His first job was to paint
the Senate corridors.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:10%
He did so in the style
of Raphael's corridors

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:49.170 align:middle line:10%
in the Vatican.

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.940 align:middle line:10%
They became known as
the Brumidi Corridors.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:58.860 align:middle line:10%
Brumidi's masterpiece is in the
Rotunda of the Capitol Temple.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.150 align:middle line:10%
Its title is "The Apotheosis
of George Washington."

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:10%
It is arcanum,
surrounded by 72 stars.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.620 align:middle line:10%
Floating in the center
of "The Apotheosis"

00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:10%
is a uniformed
Washington-- sits enthroned

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.380 align:middle line:10%
on a rainbow in
front of a sun gate.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Liberty is holding
her fasces, which

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is a goddess symbol
of transformation,

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and a combination
of Victory and Fame

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:32.950 align:middle line:84%
sounding a trumpet
that flanks him.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Apotheosis is a
Greek word that means

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to raise to god-like
stature, or the glorification

00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:90%
of a person as an ideal.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, this fresco depicts
Washington as a god-man,

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but not just any god-man.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Christian art portrays
Jesus sitting on a rainbow

00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and enthroned
exactly the same way.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Did Brumidi intend to connect
Washington with Christ?

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps so.

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:11.670 align:middle line:10%
He called Washington the
savior of the nation.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:17.050 align:middle line:10%
In his 2008 presentation,
"American Rite," William Henry

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:10%
was the first to publish
the historical discovery

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.120 align:middle line:10%
that Washington
on the rainbow was

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.140 align:middle line:10%
equivalent to the resurrected
Jesus on the rainbow.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:10%
He also identified
the US Capitol

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:10%
as a portal and a
temple of ascension.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:38.700 align:middle line:10%
William teamed up
with Dr. Mark Gray

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:44.010 align:middle line:10%
and, in 2009, they published
their book, Freedom's Gate,

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.560 align:middle line:10%
which was about the US Capitol.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:10%
Later in 2009, Dan Brown
wrote of the Capitol

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:56.900 align:middle line:10%
as a portal and "The Apotheosis"
in his book, The Lost Symbol,

00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:10%
confirming William's
original historical discovery

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.940 align:middle line:10%
that the Capitol is a
portal, and "The Apotheosis"

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:09.050 align:middle line:10%
holds a key to higher
human consciousness.

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:13.450 align:middle line:84%
As a specialist in the Tibetan
rainbow body tradition,

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
William readily observed that
both Washington and Jesus

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:20.840 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent to the
Tibetan masters who

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:25.010 align:middle line:84%
have achieved the
rainbow body of light.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Called the Great Perfection,
or mystic rapture,

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.010 align:middle line:10%
a teacher, or yogi, who
has acquired the highest

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:36.180 align:middle line:10%
forms of accomplishment
can transform

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:40.440 align:middle line:10%
the subtle aspects of
the body into pure light,

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:48.210 align:middle line:10%
or what is called the rainbow
body, or body of light.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It is not so much a body,
but rather a vortex of energy

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:59.130 align:middle line:84%
into which these adepts can
transform themselves on dying.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:03.550 align:middle line:84%
This is what Enoch
said happened to him.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:08.750 align:middle line:84%
After his translation, Enoch's
name was changed to Metatron.

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It became an angelic
guide for humans

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.345 align:middle line:90%
in their ascension journeys.

00:56:14.345 --> 00:56:18.740 align:middle line:10%
Did George Washington go through
the stargate, like Enoch?

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.520 align:middle line:10%
Is this what the
Masons were trying

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.580 align:middle line:10%
to convey in their
"Apotheosis of Washington?"

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.240 align:middle line:10%
Going beyond the
veil, we will see

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.320 align:middle line:10%
that Metatron's Cube is
embedded in "The Apotheosis."

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:38.380 align:middle line:10%
Metatron is the
heavenly name of Enoch.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.970 align:middle line:10%
In order to reveal
this, we must first

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.200 align:middle line:10%
explore some of the
other participants

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:10%
in Washington's ascension.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:50.580 align:middle line:84%
First, Washington is
flanked by Liberty and Fame.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.940 align:middle line:84%
He is guarded by Freedom,
the Goddess of America.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.070 align:middle line:10%
She wears the crown of
stars, the breast plate

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:10%
of righteousness, and other
tools of the divine realm.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi's American wife
was the model for Freedom.

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Washington is
surrounded by 13 star

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.300 align:middle line:84%
maidens, that's the
number of star systems

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.550 align:middle line:84%
where the rainbow body is
taught, say the Tibetans.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Then there is Poseidon,
the ruler of Atlantis,

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:28.600 align:middle line:90%
with a trident in his hand.

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, the Roman
name for Hermes,

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:37.860 align:middle line:84%
or Thoth, the god of arcanum,
he holds the caduceus.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Next is Hephaestus, the god
of smithcraft and alchemy.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the earth goddess,
Ceres, with young America.

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:54.930 align:middle line:84%
She holds the cornucopia,
a symbol of abundance.

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we have Benjamin
Franklin, sitting with Athena

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:02.820 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the rainbow.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
All five gods of the apotheosis,
Mercury, god of wood; Ceres,

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.580 align:middle line:84%
goddess of agriculture
and earth; Minerva,

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:20.260 align:middle line:84%
goddess of wisdom and metal;
Neptune, god of water;

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and finally, Vulcan , the god
of fire are pagan gods that died

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:31.010 align:middle line:84%
with the fall of Rome and the
advent of the Catholic Church.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:36.520 align:middle line:84%
All five have connections to
traditional European alchemy,

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and to the five elements
of Chinese alchemy, which

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.820 align:middle line:84%
are wood, fire, earth,
metal, and water.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:48.050 align:middle line:84%
These are the five pagan
gods the Vatican had

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:53.790 align:middle line:84%
spent 1,500 years
trying to destroy.

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Why did Brumidi resurrect
them for his painting?

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:03.710 align:middle line:84%
As Henry and Gray
reveal, these five gods

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:06.630 align:middle line:84%
symbolize the five
elements of alchemy:

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:11.870 align:middle line:84%
earth, air, fire,
water, and space-time.

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The pentacle, with its
five lines and five angles,

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of the
five elements together.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Revealed by Henry and
Gray for the first time,

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:27.020 align:middle line:10%
the pentacle fits
perfectly when superimposed

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:33.490 align:middle line:10%
over the gods of alchemical
elements in "The Apotheosis."

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Tibetans teach that
the rainbow body

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:40.180 align:middle line:84%
is constituted by
the five pure lights.

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They are often associated with
the five-colored Himalayan

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.980 align:middle line:84%
rainbow: white, yellow,
red, green, and blue.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.190 align:middle line:10%
The five pure lights are
understood as pure light energy

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and considered the
most sublime essence

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.460 align:middle line:10%
quality of the
classical elements named

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:05.570 align:middle line:10%
space, air, water,
fire, and earth.

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Brumidi's message
is loud and clear.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Through the discovery of arcanum
and the alchemical process,

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.640 align:middle line:90%
we attain freedom and liberty.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.810 align:middle line:10%
Now we are prepared
to go one step deeper

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:23.470 align:middle line:10%
in "The Apotheosis."

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:27.400 align:middle line:10%
Pulling back the veil, we
see that Metatron's Cube

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.200 align:middle line:10%
fits perfectly within the
layout of the Apotheosis."

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.140 align:middle line:90%
13 circles form Metatron's Cube.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It is a hexagram
inside a hexagon,

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.930 align:middle line:90%
or a cube with an cube.

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
The diagram created
by connecting

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
the centers of all the
circles in the form,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
two rings of six and
one in the center,

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is said to function as a
blueprint for the crystal

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
structures of all
carbon-based life.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's Cube was discovered
by the brilliant 13th century

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Italian mathematician
and discoverer

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
of the golden mean
ratio, Leonardo Pisano,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.410 align:middle line:90%
better known as Fibonacci.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:19.720 align:middle line:10%
It represents magic,
alchemy, and ascension.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.270 align:middle line:10%
Out of the box is exactly where
meditating on Metatron's Cube

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.690 align:middle line:10%
takes us.

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:30.620 align:middle line:10%
It opens the way to higher
dimensional thinking,

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.380 align:middle line:10%
or multi-dimensional
consciousness.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.190 align:middle line:10%
It takes us out of the
wilderness of earth life

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:44.208 align:middle line:10%
into the heavenly realms, to
the realm of the free souls.

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:48.870 align:middle line:10%
If Metatron's Cube does indeed
symbolize the Philosopher's

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:55.040 align:middle line:10%
Stone, it is the lost symbol and
the lost keystone of the Temple

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.370 align:middle line:10%
of Liberty, the US Capitol.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:03.690 align:middle line:10%
This would explain why the
Metatron's Cube geometry fits

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:08.150 align:middle line:10%
so eloquently on "Apotheosis
of George Washington,"

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.660 align:middle line:10%
who it now appears
has become not

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:15.600 align:middle line:10%
just meta-human, but Metatron.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.430 align:middle line:10%
This is why Henry and Gray call
"The Apotheosis" the greatest

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:23.760 align:middle line:10%
alchemical icon of all time.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.650 align:middle line:10%
Did Constantino Brumidi
plan to create it?

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:30.250 align:middle line:10%
Or did it just happen?

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Before his death in 1871, one
of the Brumidi's daughters,

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.630 align:middle line:10%
who was finally allowed to
leave Italy, visited her father

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:44.890 align:middle line:10%
and saw his
masterpiece of arcanum.

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:47.960 align:middle line:84%
It must have been a
very moving moment.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.608 align:middle line:84%
Even Raphael would
have been proud.

01:02:50.608 --> 01:02:54.110 align:middle line:90%


01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Arcanum."

01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.860 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.
