an unlikely team of soldiers

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
was charged with
identifying and protecting

to one of locating
and recovering

Germany, his home, to
display the art plundered

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
all of the works instead of
losing them to the Allies.

>>WILLIAM: We were very close
to losing these works of art.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Hitler believed that if
he destroyed this art,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
it would erase the

with leads about
missing cultural items

>>WILLIAM: Among the
paintings the Monuments Men

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:84%
recovered is arguably the single
most influential painting ever

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:90%
made.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's also considered the
world's most coveted painting,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
having been stolen seven
times during its history.

>>CLARE: Known as the
"Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,"

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
this incredible piece of art

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
at the start of the
Second World War.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
It was ordered seized
by Hitler in 1942.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
"The Mystic Lamb" was stored
in a salt mine in Austria

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
along with thousands of
other looted works of art.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Hitler believed that
"The Mystic Lamb"

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:90%
contained a coded message.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Perhaps a
map leading to what

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
may be the most powerful lost
artifact of human history.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: What is that relic?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Better yet, where is it?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the subject of
William's feature investigation.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: In 2006, I was in
the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I had spent considerable time
in the city, as well as DC,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.512 align:middle line:84%
researching the
Founding Fathers.

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And while in the
Philadelphia Art Museum,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I was wandering around
the Renaissance section,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and I came to this
extraordinary painting.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was absolutely
mesmerized by it.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know why.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
I suppose it had to do with
this image here of Jesus

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
as a butterfly angel.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen such an
image of Jesus before,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and I just stood there
kind of stunned, wondering,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%
who is this artist?

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And why is he portraying
Jesus as a butterfly

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:90%
angel, a winged angel?

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
This moment prompted
me to begin to pull

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
on the golden thread
of this painting,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that the
artist was Jan van Eyck, who

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.085 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about throughout
our episode today.

00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he was doing
here was actually

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
showing the stigmatization of
Saint Francis of Assisi, who

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
in a vision saw Jesus manifest
not as a butterfly angel, as I

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
had described him, but actually
as a seraphim, the highest

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
order of angels.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what Van Eyck was
expressing here, in part,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
was the Renaissance belief
that the highest aspiration

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
of humans was to
become seraphim angels.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
This was the stated
ideal of Marsilio Ficino,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the great mastermind behind
Sandro Botticelli and so many

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.880 align:middle line:90%
other great Renaissance masters.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:84%
They believed that humans had
it within their capability

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to transform into the seraphim
angels, beings of pure light

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and pure love, and
that in fact this

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
is how Jesus manifested
on the Earth plane

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:90%
after the Resurrection.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that was
not enough, I mean,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck had so much
more waiting for me

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
than the recognition
that the seraphim are

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
part of our earthly
ideal and that we all

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:84%
have it within us to become
these magnificent angelic

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
As I began researching
Van Eyck, I soon

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
learned that he was thought of
as a secret agent, a genius,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:90%
certainly a mystic.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
He was an alchemist and,
absolutely, a painter.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.980 align:middle line:90%
This is his self-portrait.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Just take a look in those eyes.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Think about the insight
and the reflection

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that this man must
have possessed

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:90%
in order to do what he did.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Because as I'm going
to show you here,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Jan van Eyck was one of the
most powerful mystics of Arcanum

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.879 align:middle line:90%
who ever walked the Earth.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
Van Eyck paintings

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.385 align:middle line:90%
is "The Last Judgment."

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's int he Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Today it's two
paintings side by side,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's thought to
have been a triptych.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And my mind can only imagine
what that third painting

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:90%
must have contained.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Here in the painting,
we see Jesus

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the
rainbow body of light.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people when they
see this painting, like others,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:84%
to mirror what they
are seeing here.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
If you want to reflect the
light that Christ is manifesting

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
in this painting
by Van Eyck, hands

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
up, mirrors to your
screen, and reflect

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
or mirror what
Jesus is doing here.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.862 align:middle line:84%
And see if you
can tap in or tune

00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
in to the vibrancy and the light
that is radiating from Jesus

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
in this extraordinary
painting, the rainbow

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:84%
aura, the light illuminating
or manifesting from his hands.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck clearly had
an extraordinary eye

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.102 align:middle line:84%
and an insight into the
Resurrection of Jesus

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Archangel
Michael here,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the detail of Michael
as the peacock angel.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
How was it that Van
Eyck was able to achieve

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
such extraordinary detail?

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Ah, now there's
the key question.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
that Jan Van Eyck

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:84%
is, according to legend, the
man who invented oil painting.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
That forever changed
painting as we know it,

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and that is how he
was able to achieve

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:90%
such extraordinary detail.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
His "Annunciation,"
which is in the National

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Gallery in Washington, DC,
is another of my favorites.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the painting is
a dove radiating seven rays

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
as it descends into the
open crown chakra of Mary.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, detail
unavailable previous

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to Van Eyck's advancement
with oil painting.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And here we see
the dove descending

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
on the beam of light, going
into Mary's open crown chakra,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.990 align:middle line:84%
as indicated by the jewel
on the top of her head.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But the painting, the world's
most mystic painting--

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the most coveted
painting, we're told,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
in all of art history-- is
Jan Van Eyck's painting,

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:42.409 align:middle line:84%
"The Mystic Lamb," also featured
as part of the Ghent Altar

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:90%
piece.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is the subject of
our investigation today.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Artists and art
historians marvel, again,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
at the level of detail that
Van Eyck was able to achieve.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:90%
The work itself is massive.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:90%
It's almost 12 feet tall.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
It was made for a private
chapel in St. Bavo

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck is
mythically, as I said,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:84%
credited with the
invention of oil painting.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
This invention or innovation
ignited the imagination

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
of artists and allowed them to
capture detail as never before.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You can make out details in
the hair of John the Baptist

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and the radiant light
coming off of his body,

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:84%
even going into the
fabric behind him.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely extraordinary.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
We see God the Father--
or, some believe,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Christ-- on the throne,
holding the staff of Arcanum.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
On the right, John the
Baptist, holding the open book.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Mary, reading another
book on the left side.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The title of these
books-- undoubtedly

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Arcanum, absolutely.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Look at the jewel on the
chest here of God the Father,

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:90%
or Christ.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The detail is just
absolutely amazing,

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
as is that on his
ornamented headpiece here.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Just breathtaking
to all who stand

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
before this remarkable
work of art.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The Ghent Altar piece is
considered the most important

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
work of art history for this
reason, because of the detail.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Centuries of collectors,
aristocracy, generals, kings,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
have coveted this work.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Murder, theft,
war are just a few

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
of the machinations employed to
secure possession of this work.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it simply because
of its mastery?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something else?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Worth noting is that there is
some controversy about exactly

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
who painted "The Mystic Lamb."

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Some say it was painted
by Jan van Eyck.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Others say it was
his brother, Herbert.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Together, though, we have
to assume that both of them

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:84%
worked on this
extraordinary masterpiece.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's safe to say that both
had a hand in conceiving

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and executing this masterpiece.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
They used oil in a
way never seen before.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of matter
is is that the "Adoration

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Mystic
Lamb" is considered

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to be the most mystical
painting of all time.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I refer to it as sort of like
the Renaissance Beatles-on-"Ed

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Sullivan" moment.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it not only
showed great masters

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:84%
like Leonardo and Botticelli
and others what to do,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
but also how to do it.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was a parade of
these incredible geniuses who

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
all came to spend
time witnessing

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
the "Adoration of
the Mystic Lamb"

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as the entire
Ghent Altar piece.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And so let's dive into this
painting and see what's here,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and try to pull
back the veil on it

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and find out-- why is this
considered the greatest

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
masterpiece and the most
mystical painting of all time?

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
What was it that Leonardo,
Botticelli, Fra Angelico,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Giotto, among others--
Gustave Dore--

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
were inspired by when
they saw this masterpiece?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
What is here that the
eye doesn't readily

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
see at first sight, that is
encoded within this painting?

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, as
I said, that this

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
was the moment that
changed painting forever--

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
just as I said, like the
Beatles on "Ed Sullivan" changed

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
rock-and-roll music forever
and sent popular culture off

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
on a new direction.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Looking at "The
Mystic Lamb" here,

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.100 align:middle line:84%
we see this radiant light
manifesting from the lamb.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And to some people,
it's just kind

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:84%
of an interesting painting,
but to others with eyes to see,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%
there's so much more here.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So as we take a peek
here, we ask, what was it

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that Hitler and
others in particular

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
sought to discover
in this painting?

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Why was this painting number
one on the Nazi checklist

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of paintings to be stolen
during World War II?

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact
that before the war,

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Nazi art historians and scholars
had scoured the world's art

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
museums, certainly
European museums--

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
the British Museum, the
Louvre, and others--

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and they actually made
a checklist of paintings

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that they intended to
secure once the Nazis had

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:90%
taken over Europe.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
High on the list,
not top on the list,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
was "The Mystic Lamb"
by Jan van Eyck.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So what was it
that Hitler sought?

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.530 align:middle line:90%
The answer is Arcanum.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It's open on its hinges
for religious holidays

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but remains closed for most
of the year, at which point

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
only eight of the 20 panels
of the Ghent Altar piece

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:90%
are visible.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
When closed, we see at the top
the prophets and the sigils

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
predicting the coming
of the Messiah.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Is this what intrigued Hitler?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We know that Hitler fancied
himself as the Nazi Messiah.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Was there something in
this painting, perhaps,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that might have,
in Hitler's mind,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
been able to assist him in his
quest for global domination,

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:90%
but also Nazi Messiah-ship?

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the
prophets and the sibyls

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
with the prophecy of the
coming of the Messiah.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Below is the event
that they prophesied.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
We see the Archangel
Gabriel announcing to Mary

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
that she will soon
conceive the Christ child.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.810 align:middle line:84%
On the left is the
Archangel Gabriel,

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
also with her peacock wings,
holding the lily in her hand.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And on the right, we
see the Virgin Mary

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
receiving the dove
of the Holy Spirit

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
with a rainbow enfolding
the dove's head.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And then in between is
where we see a cityscape.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Want to offer a
special thanks here

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to the "Closer to Van
Eyck" project, which

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is a very valuable
study resource.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:84%
This website
presents the results

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
from the Lasting
Support, which is

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.340 align:middle line:84%
an interdisciplinary
research project devoted

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
to maintaining the
Ghent Altar piece.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Commissioned by the
Churchwardens of St. Bavo's

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, and
at the initiative of the Getty

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, the main sponsor
of the Lasting Support,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the project's findings
were made available

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
to the public in 2012, along
with breathtaking images

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:90%
of the painting.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's fair to say that the Ghent
Altar piece and "The Mystic

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Lamb" is the single most studied
painting in the world, as well.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, in between
Archangel Gabriel and Mary,

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
we see this cityscape
with extraordinary detail.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And beside it, what do
we see but the symbol

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Chintamani,
the triple-dot symbol.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Now that tells us we're
on the right path here.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that we're
on the path of Arcanum.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it must be that Van
Eyck was clueing us in

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to look for his
alchemical secrets here.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the detail here,
we see, once again,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel wearing
her jeweled crown.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
She's got her jewel
at her heart chakra.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
We see her holding the lily.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And then look at this
just magnificent detail

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
here, provided by
the Getty Foundation.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.265 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely extraordinary.

00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is is that
when you visit that website,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
you can go into microscopic
detail on this painting,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a detail never before
seen until Jan or Herbert Van

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Eyck envisioned this painting
in their own minds' eye.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Look at Mary here, solemn,
in this sacred pose,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:84%
that jewel once again indicating
her heart chakra as well

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:90%
as her crown chakra.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we see the descent
of this magnificent dove,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing the descent
of the Holy Spirit,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
this holy cosmic vibration,
also with the rainbow encircling

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:90%
the dove's head.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment when this
powerful sacred vibration

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
enters into the
consciousness of Mary,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and she is then transformed
into the Christ-bearer.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We see the open book beside
her-- the Book of Arcanum,

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
assuredly.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Look at the crown
of the Virgin here.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:90%
We see the jewels on the crown.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:90%
We see the 12 stars on her head.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
mind-boggling in the detail

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and also in its
symbolism, as well.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, put yourself
in the position

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:90%
of a Botticelli or a Leonardo.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
You're just beginning
your career.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:22.209 align:middle line:84%
You make the pilgrimage
to St. Bavo's in Ghent

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and you stand before this
magnificent masterpiece.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder,
how can I top this?

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like any
rock-and-roll singer

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.480 align:middle line:84%
who says, how can
you top the Beatles?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
How can you top
Lennon-McCartney?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, these artists
take it is a challenge.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They're empowered
now because of what

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Van Eyck has given to them.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, not only showing
them what to do,

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:90%
but also how to do it.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
In the background here,
we see Mary Magdalene

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:90%
holding the alabaster jar.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:90%
She's hidden.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:90%
She's concealed.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
She's a spectator, in a
way, of these proceedings,

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
hinting at the feminine
mysteries of the Magdalene

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
that alabaster jar.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Its contents, of course,
contained the sacred oil

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
that she used to anoint Jesus
just before his Resurrection.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible,
as the Gnostics say,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
that it is the oil
within this jar that

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
dissolved Jesus' body into
light, that enabled him

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to manifest his
Resurrection body.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Now here's a key
to this painting.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It fits in with what we've
heard from so many other artists

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
in our Arcanum series.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And that is that Van Eyck
intended this painting

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:90%
to be a meditative aid.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
He did this by inserting
clever cross references

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:84%
between the items in the
painting and the Mass

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
in which it was opened.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a towel similar
to the one worn by the altar

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
boys at the Mass is
painted in a niche.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
This links the events
of the painting

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:90%
with the Mass being performed.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Here's the idea.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:90%
You are here.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You are not a viewer
of this painting.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.610 align:middle line:90%
You're not a spectator.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck intended you to be a
participant in this painting.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:90%
It is a meditative aid.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We are to embrace this
painting, to contemplate on it,

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:84%
meditate on it,
and reflect on it,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and participate in this
extraordinary proceeding, where

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
we see this gathering of saints
and wise men and wizards,

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
gathering around
the Mystic Lamb.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
We are here in this
painting at this moment.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck is directly
linking us at this moment

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to what is transpiring in
this extraordinary scene.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We see a procession of saints
moving towards the Lamb

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
on an altar at the center
of this mystical field.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Look at the white
specks on the ground.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that manna, the food of
the gods, the star food that

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
fed the light bodies
of the Israelites?

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as the Israelites are
wandering in the wilderness,

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
suddenly comes
these white flakes

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
that appear on the
ground in the morning.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Israelites
eat this manna,

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
and it fed them
for over 40 years

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
during their wanderings
in the wilderness.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps that's what Van
Eyck is intending here,

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is to see the manna
on the ground.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we're participating
in the painting,

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
we're reaching out
and feeling ourselves

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
ingesting this sacred star food.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
As we see the beams
of light coming down,

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:84%
we realize that we're
now being anointed

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
by the rays coming
from the cosmic dove.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:84%
We are amongst the
saints and the druids

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and the wise men
who are congregating

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
in this extraordinary
scene, who are congregating

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
around the Mystic
Lamb on the red altar.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:84%
We see a circle of angels,
a circle of star beings,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
in fact, who are gathered
around this mystical altar.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
The Lamb is shedding
blood from its chest

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
as it's being poured into
the Holy Grail sitting

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
on the altar.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Another angel holds a cross.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Another angel holds a spear.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me that they
might be bringing a kit of tools

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Hm, that's a very
powerful speculation

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
we'll come back to
here in a moment.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Here in the detail, we see the
Mystic Lamb, the radiant Lamb,

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
spilling its blood into the cup.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're asked to consider
that this is actually

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
a symbol of Christ, the
pure Lamb, the Lamb of God.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But it may be something
else, as well.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no sunlight in
this mystical setting.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the light of the Holy
Spirit descends like a dove

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and illuminates the scene
with this divine glow.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We see this spray
of light coming

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
from this otherworldly source,
from the dove, radiating

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
into this mystical field
but also reaching out

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
into our field as
well, our energy field.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're being encouraged
here by Van Eyck

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and catch rays
from this mystical light source.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
What we see here is reflected
in the Gospel of John,

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
where it says, "I saw
the spirit descending

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:90%
from heaven like a dove."

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, Van Eyck is bathing
us in the spirit of the dove,

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
or the Holy Spirit.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So feel this painting
just for a moment.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Connect with this divine
light radiating from the dove.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And place yourself here
and ask the question,

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is
happening at this moment?

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.030 align:middle line:84%
What is this circle
of star beings

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
gathered together to accomplish?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
maybe Hitler would

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:84%
have seen as he's
looking at this painting?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Why did they covet this
painting so desperately?

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
What information might be
coded in this painting that

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
would have prompted the Nazis
to go to extraordinary lengths

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:90%
to get a hold of this painting?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, in the detail,
we see the dove,

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.650 align:middle line:84%
we see the radiant light
coming from the dove,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and the spray of light all
around this mystic field.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And amplifying the
detail here, now

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, we're opening
our own energy field,

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're feeling
this holy light

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:90%
coming into our energy field.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.454 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.454 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Here's a key insight
into this painting.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it a meditative
aid and we're a participant,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:84%
but actually, what
Van Eyck is showing

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
us is that this scene takes
place at the throne of God.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Folks, this means
that this scene is not

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:90%
taking place on Earth.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
What Van Eyck is imagining for
us is an otherworldly location,

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and not just like any
otherworldly location--

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the throne of God,
Sion, as talked

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
about in the book of Hebrews,
the home of the just humans

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
made perfect as well as angelic
beings called the Watchers.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The aim of all
Judeo-Christian civilization

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:84%
is to connect with Sion and to
join all the angels gathered

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:84%
in joyful assembly
and the just humans

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
made perfect-- meaning
whole, holy, and complete.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
We know that this is the
throne of God because

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:84%
of the presence of the fountain
of life before the altar.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:84%
What Van Eyck has done is
something quite clever.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Around the octagonal pedestal
upon which the fountain sits

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is inscribed, "This
is the fountain

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of the water of life flowing
from the throne of God

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and the Lamb."

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement from the
Book of Revelation chapter

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.700 align:middle line:84%
20, verse 1 and is a
description of Sion,

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the location of God's throne.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So look at the detail
here, unimaginable

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
before the innovation
of oil painting.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:84%
We see the water dripping
from this fountain.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
We've got an angel
up on top and we've

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.090 align:middle line:84%
got this octagonal pedestal
that's filled with water.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but as we look
at the base of the pedestal,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:90%
we see actually-- I apologize.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go back here.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
We see water flowing
from a gargoyle

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the pedestal.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
This water is
literally now spilling

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.700 align:middle line:84%
into the room around you
in Van Eyck's imagination,

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and you are connecting with the
fountain of the water of life.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
That's none less than the
fountain of immortality.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can drink
from these waters,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:90%
we will become immortal beings.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The book of Hebrews
says that, "You

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.070 align:middle line:84%
have come to Sion,
to the Heavenly

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem, the city
of the living God.

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
You have come to
thousands upon thousands

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:90%
of angels in joyful assembly."

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the
otherworldly location

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that Van Eyck is imagining
for us in this painting

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and rendering for us
in our imaginations.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, it informs us
that we are not on Earth.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We are at the center
of the cosmos.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.060 align:middle line:84%
We are at the source
place of our souls,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:84%
according to
Judeo-Christian culture.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We are in not only Sion,
we are also in Eden itself,

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:90%
our place of origin.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And we are connecting
with the fountain

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of the waters of life,
the waters of immortality.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Because again, from the
octagonal stone basin

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
rises this brass column that's
surmounted by this angel.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the angel
referred to in Revelation 22:1,

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
where it says, "The angel showed
me the river of water of life,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.510 align:middle line:84%
as clear as a crystal,
flowing from the throne of God

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and of the Lamb down the
middle of the great street

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:90%
of the city.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
On each side of the river
stood the tree of life,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:84%
bearing 12 crops of
fruit, yielding its fruit

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:90%
for every month."

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the angel of Revelation
presented to us by Jan van

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Eyck.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The water flows in jets from
two vases borne by the angel

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and from gargoyles or dragons
attached to the column.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And here in the
detail, once again, we

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
see the gargoyle
with the open mouth,

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
with the water of life spilling
into the room around us.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
This is before
television, remember,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
when the imagination was fed
by paintings such as this.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And individuals had never seen
anything like this before.

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And so here they
are being prepped,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
understanding that this
is a meditative aid,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:84%
that they are in fact
participating in this scene.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And without outside influences,
such as TV and just the flood

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.050 align:middle line:84%
of images that we have on
a daily basis in our minds,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the participants would
stand before this

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and activate the power
of their imagination,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and feel that water
spilling all around them.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You can just imagine the
room literally flooding

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.980 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's ankle-deep.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's deeper.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And they are wading
through these sacred waters

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:90%
as they adore the Mystic Lamb.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can feel it now
in your own energy field.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly-- and here's
the key to the painting,

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
in my view-- Adolf Hitler was
convinced that "The Mystic

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Lamb" contained a
coded map identifying

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the location of the lost Arma
Christi, the instruments or kit

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:84%
of Christ's Passion
and crucifixion.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Hitler, again, fancied himself
as a Nazi Messiah, an Aryan

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Messiah.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And he thought that if he could
get a hold of the various tools

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and implements connected with
the crucifixion of Jesus,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that he would receive the power
of those tools and implements

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and it would aid
him in his quest

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:90%
to become the Nazi Messiah.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
In Christian end time art,
this kit I'm referring to

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
is called that Etimasia, or the
throne of the Second Coming,

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:90%
the instruments of the Passion.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
It's most often composed
of the cross, which

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is known to mystics and
purveyors of the Arcanum

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
as an instrument
of transmutation.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not an
instrument of torture

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
as thought of by
traditional Christianity.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's an instrument
of transmutation

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that converts flesh or mass
into light, spirit, or energy.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, Christ is
represented as the central stem

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of life,
which is also the cross.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The cross, of course,
was made from wood

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that is thought to
have originally grown

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:90%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
In our "Philosopher's
Stone" episode,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the rod
or wand utilized by Jesus.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:84%
That is believed in
Christian tradition

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to be a branch that grew
from the tree of life.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So that wand is actually sort
of like the remote control

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.810 align:middle line:90%
to the computer, if you will.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a piece of the greater
whole that in fact operates it.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The second tool or implement
that's part of the Etimasia

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
is a spear that pierced
the side of Christ.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the Spear of Destiny.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Many occult Nazi
researchers know

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that Adolf Hitler was
obsessed with acquiring

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:90%
the Spear of Destiny.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And they want you to believe
that it's a simple Roman

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.810 align:middle line:84%
centurion's spear that was
used to poke the side of Christ

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:90%
as he stood upon the cross.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.050 align:middle line:84%
The legend has it that he who
acquired the Spear of Destiny

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:90%
would rule the world.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to tell you,
that's a wonderful story,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.890 align:middle line:84%
that that centurion's spear is a
simple Roman centurion's spear,

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:84%
and that it was actually housed
in the Habsburg treasure room,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:90%
as lore tells us.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But Adolf Hitler
was many things,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
but stupid is not one of them.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
He assuredly knew
that when we're

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
talking about the cross,
the spear, the sponge,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:84%
and other items, that we're
talking about something far

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
more mystical and
profound than most people

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.080 align:middle line:90%
have previously ascertained.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And we know for a fact
that Hitler and the Nazi SS

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.260 align:middle line:84%
were deeply, deeply steeped
in the lore of the Holy

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Grail, Atlantis, and other
of these occult subjects.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And they must have
known what we now know,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
profound mystical tools

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
or implements that are capable
of manipulating energy--

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
specifically the
human energy field.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And it is the Arcanum that
transforms an ordinary mortal

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:84%
into a superhuman being--
primary object of the Nazis'

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:90%
quest.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Another piece in this kit
of tools or implements

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
is the scroll or a
book, which at one level

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
could represent the
Gospels, but also represents

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly tablets of
ancient Sumeria and Egypt,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Life, the
Book of Seven Seals,

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and also the fabled
Book of Love, as well.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Another tool or
implement is the robe

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
of light, which is called the
perfect garment or the star

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
body garment.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, a jar containing
sacred oil is often present.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Later, a crown and other
instruments of the Passion

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:90%
are added.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So these are the fundamental
pieces of the Etimasia,

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the throne of Christ or the
throne of the Second Coming,

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.640 align:middle line:84%
or this "ascension kit,"
as I'm describing here.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Here is a 12th
century representation

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of this kit of tools, as
found in a church in Rome.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:84%
What we see is
the cross attached

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.360 align:middle line:90%
to a box or platform, an altar.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:90%
We see a cloak of stars.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.530 align:middle line:90%
We see a book.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:90%
We see the Spear of Destiny.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:84%
We see three nails,
the grail cup.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:90%
We see a crown.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:90%
All this, guarded by two angels.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Now let's come back
to the Mystic Lamb.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:90%
We see the altar, or the box.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We see the cross,
the spear, the crown.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I see what's happening.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
This circle of star
beings or angels

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
is actually gathering the
tools or implements utilized

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:84%
in the manifestation of the
light body or Resurrection

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:90%
body of Christ.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.010 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
tools or implements

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
that are to be rediscovered at
the time of the Second Coming,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.720 align:middle line:90%
or what is called Judgment Day.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I've written a book called "The
Judgment Day Device" about all

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
of these tools or implements
and their function,

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.240 align:middle line:90%
and where they might be located.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Here's a Russian
example of the Etimasia.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We see the altar, the book, the
cross, the spear-- the tools

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:90%
or implements all come together.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:17.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what is thought of as
the complete cross of Christ.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Investigators realized
that a crucifix by itself

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:90%
is not the cross of crucifixion.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
The cross of crucifixion is
this complete set of tools.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And assuredly, Hitler
knew that, as well.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The complete set is the spear,
the cross, the platform,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.889 align:middle line:84%
and also the star
cloak, which we're

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.739 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about in
detail momentarily, as well

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:48.190 align:middle line:90%
as the book.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
In Transfiguration
images, Jesus is

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:84%
portrayed wearing a bright
white garment of light in front

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.890 align:middle line:84%
of an open gate, sometimes
filled with stars

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and composed of various
geometric shapes,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:84%
such as the
almond-shaped mandorlas,

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
or vesica piscis,
filled with stars.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, what he's
done in the Transfiguration

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is put on this cloak or
garment and opened a stargate.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I say this to say because
ultimately, what Hitler

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:19.890 align:middle line:84%
was seeking through
"The Mystic Lamb" was

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of transfiguration
or metamorphosis--

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
how to transform an ordinary
human into a superhuman being.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Now whether he intended to
utilize this immense power

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
of these tools or
implements for himself,

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
personally and
exclusively for himself,

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:84%
or two aid in his quest to
create the super or master

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
race, is unknown.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But assuredly, the
Nazi researchers

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:84%
knew that this is what
they were seeking,

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:84%
was the secret of
human transmutation

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.710 align:middle line:84%
or transfiguration,
and that's what's

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.190 align:middle line:90%
encoded in "The Mystic Lamb."

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.580 align:middle line:84%
"Blessed are those who
wash their robes, that they

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
may have the right
to the tree of life

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and may go through the
gates into the city."

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The Bible is absolutely
clear that in order

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to enter the celestial Sion,
we have to transmute our flesh.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The Bible is clear, as well,
that flesh and blood cannot

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:90%
inherit the kingdom of heaven.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.550 align:middle line:84%
This is absolute,
direct evidence

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that we must in fact transmute
our body into light or energy

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.360 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to going
through that gate

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to dwell in
the celestial realms.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk for a
moment about the platform

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.360 align:middle line:90%
upon which the cross sits.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Because what we realize is
that ark or platform is in fact

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant, the Old
Testament device that was made,

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.760 align:middle line:84%
identified, by Moses at
the base of Mount Sinai.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Now most researchers,
when they show you

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant will
show you a simple golden box,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:middle line:84%
such as this here
portrayed in James Tissot's

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:90%
wonderful painting.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.284 align:middle line:84%
But actually, guys, this
isn't the complete Ark

00:37:04.284 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
This is just part of the ark.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
This is just the box.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.200 align:middle line:84%
The complete Ark
of the Covenant,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:84%
according to the book of
Exodus, includes the Rod

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.580 align:middle line:84%
of Enlightenment,
the rod of Aaron,

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.710 align:middle line:90%
whose name means enlightenment.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:84%
It includes the flask
of manna, the cruse

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of anointing oil, as well as the
stone tablets, which I believe

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:84%
are the Chintamani, or
the Philosopher's Stone.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the complete Ark of the
Covenant kit, fully assembled.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:84%
This is also the
complete cross of Christ.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:84%
It's also the throne
of the Second Coming.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I get it.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The complete Ark of the
Covenant and the complete cross

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:90%
of Christ are the same thing.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a revelation.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that Hitler and the Nazis,

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.660 align:middle line:84%
as well as the American
authorities, must have known.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you do
once you have fully

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.310 align:middle line:84%
assembled this
complete kit of tools?

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The star cloak, the ark, the
cross, the book, the spear,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:90%
the cup?

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Well of course,
you open a portal.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You bring in the Christ being,
the star being, the Christ

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:20.396 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:38:20.396 --> 00:38:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Why does Christ need a
kit of tools like this?

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:84%
As I look at this,
the answer comes

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.450 align:middle line:84%
from the Book of Revelation,
where John the Revelator

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.860 align:middle line:84%
saw the Ark of the Covenant
at the throne of Christ.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.340 align:middle line:84%
What that tells me is
that there's at least two

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:90%
of these devices.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
There's one on Earth and
one in the heavenly realms.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.800 align:middle line:90%
And they must be connected.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And it suggests to me this idea.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:84%
This is my
interpretation on this.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That is-- Christ and
these avatar-type beings

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.790 align:middle line:84%
are super-high-frequency
fast-moving beings.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And in order to manifest
on the Earth plane,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:84%
it appears that they must
step down their frequency.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that's what the
Ark of the Covenant throne kit,

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:90%
or ascension kit of Christ, is.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.720 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact,
based on the statements

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Exodus, that
Yahweh, the Old Testament God,

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.480 align:middle line:84%
used the Ark of the
Covenant as his throne.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh manifested as
a humanoid luminous--

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:84%
in fact, rainbow-like being
on the ark throne, which

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:90%
functioned as his footstool.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me that
Jesus utilized it

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:90%
for the opposite purpose.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:84%
He used it in order to
not enter this realm,

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.300 align:middle line:90%
but to exit this realm.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And when Christ returns
at the Second Coming,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
it appears, at least according
to Christian tradition,

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that this kit of tools
must be reassembled.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
So who does that?

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
in the time of Jesus,

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.300 align:middle line:84%
it was his brother James who
was responsible for this.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:84%
James was part of a long line
of figures called rainmakers

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:84%
who assembled this kit of
tools, disassembled it, and then

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
reassembled it at various
times throughout history.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And undoubtedly James
or one of the rainmakers

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
will reappear at the time
the Second Coming in order

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to reassemble this kit of tools.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Why are they called rainmakers?

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Well the answer is
is because Christ

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and these other
ascended beings ride

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:90%
through the cosmos on clouds.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.000 align:middle line:90%
And clouds bring rain.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Hence the pun-- they who know
the secrets of this device

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.620 align:middle line:90%
are the rainmakers.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And so here we see the Ark
of the Covenant producing

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.870 align:middle line:84%
this mystic cloud called the
Shekhinah, the Divine Glory,

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.690 align:middle line:84%
which is the throne upon
which Yahweh manifests.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
At Saint-Denis, outside
Paris in France,

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I took this photo that
shows the complete cross

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and a complete Ark
of the Covenant.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Here's the ark,
here's the cross,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and the other
tools or implements

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:84%
are included within
the golden box.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
In this example, the
angels are on either side.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We see the ark
with the footstool.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.320 align:middle line:84%
We see the flask of
manna, the cross attached.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the complete
Ark of the Covenant.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the complete
cross of Christ.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Hitler knew it.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely knew it.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And he furthermore believed that
"The Mystic Lamb" by Jan Van

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Eyck would tell him the actual
location of these various tools

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.920 align:middle line:84%
or implements so that he could
put this whole kit together

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and assist him in his quest
to be the Nazi Messiah.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So here we see the footstool,
the flask of manna.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:90%
There's our cloak, the book.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Going back one slide,
the cross is attached.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.790 align:middle line:84%
We have the complete
Ark of the Covenant,

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.900 align:middle line:90%
the complete cross of Christ.

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:90%
They're the same thing.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example
where we see the angels

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:84%
with the cross attached, the
book, the cloak, the footstool.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:90%
That's the ark.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the cross.

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Etimasia, or
the throne of the Second Coming.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And another couple examples--
then we'll get back to "The

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Mystic Lamb"-- where we see
the complete kit of tools,

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:84%
with Christ riding above
in the so-called cloud,

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.020 align:middle line:84%
but which we readily identify as
in fact a portal or a gateway.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Is this device in fact some
kind of a stargate device?

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's
exactly what it is,

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and I derive that just from
the function of these tools

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.950 align:middle line:90%
or implements.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And here's Mary, reading up.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:40.660 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting on
what appears to be

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a platform,
which is actually probably

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
with the cross attached

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.810 align:middle line:84%
and all the other various
tools or implements.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It was actually this painting
that inspired my thinking

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that the ark and the complete
kit of ascension tools

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is formulated or created
in our consciousness.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Shown here is an image
of the Arma Christi

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:84%
from a 14th century book
shelved in the Royal

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Collection of the
British Library.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It's divided into a series of
38 compartments, each of which

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.180 align:middle line:84%
depicts images of the
instruments of the Passion,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:84%
or the Arma Christi, or
some other object or event

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.630 align:middle line:90%
emblematic of the Passion.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We see the hammer, the
cock that crew three times,

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:84%
the dice, the pelican, the wound
in Christ's side, and so forth.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And the text that
accompanies it declares

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that whoever recites the
prayer "Ave facies praeclara"

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and looks at the image
with devotion, intensity,

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:84%
meditation, contemplation, will
receive an indulgence of three

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:46.100 align:middle line:84%
years and may experience a
beatific vision of Christ

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in which the glory pours
down upon the meditater.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:84%
The creator of this
image map-- or mind

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.600 align:middle line:84%
map, as I term it--
apparently believed

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.270 align:middle line:84%
that connecting the dots
of these symbols in one's

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.290 align:middle line:84%
consciousness could
result in the sudden burst

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
or shower of cosmic
energy or light,

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:84%
a baptism in the
glory of the Lord,

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.490 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate a-ha experience.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:90%
And with that, a-ha!

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what these
painters are all about.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to create
meditative aids whereby

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.160 align:middle line:84%
you connect the dots and are
able to then shower yourself

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:84%
with this glory or
this powerful energy.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what we see in
all these paintings.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And Hitler then
believed that possession

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of the Arma Christi within
would grant their owner

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:90%
supernatural capabilities.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It was also, of course, known to
American authorities, as well.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.160 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of "Men
Who Stare at Goats"?

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
How about men who stare at
paintings, who contemplate,

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.300 align:middle line:84%
meditate, and reflect
on these images

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and connect the dots
in their consciousness,

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and are then able to trigger
this internal activation

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.084 align:middle line:90%
of their own consciousness?

00:45:02.084 --> 00:45:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, forget about
looking for the Ark

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant in Ethiopia
or the US capital or all

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.460 align:middle line:84%
these other places
people think it is.

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It's within us.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to connect
the dots within ourselves

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and activate our
consciousness ourselves.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the message of
Arcanum and the message

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:90%
of all these great painters.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there actual
devices out here?

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.390 align:middle line:84%
That's still a very
real possibility.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Because humans always
want to duplicate

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:35.150 align:middle line:84%
the natural capabilities of the
body with technology out here.

00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, a panel
called the "Just Judges,"

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or the "Righteous
Judges," is thought

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to conceal the location of
the actual physical tools

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.120 align:middle line:84%
or implements of
the Arma Christi.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Hubert van Eyck painted himself
and Jan Van Eyck in a panel

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:84%
together with the just judges,
these righteous judges.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
He did this because this
panel contained a crucial key

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
to solving the location
of the Arma Christi.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And so here we see
the Van Eyck brothers

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.910 align:middle line:84%
having painted themselves into
this painting as participants

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and, I think, sending people
actually off on a wild goose

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.850 align:middle line:84%
chase, looking all over
Europe for these tools

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
or implements everywhere but
where they're actually located,

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.770 align:middle line:90%
which is within.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is, this
panel was stolen in 1934

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and never recovered.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:27.100 align:middle line:84%
There is, however,
a copy in existence.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Also stolen is the Saint
John the Baptist panel,

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:84%
showing John holding
the Mystic Lamb.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The panel was removed
from the frame, apparently

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:40.630 align:middle line:84%
with care, leaving the
other panels undamaged.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so here's a photograph
from the day it was stolen,

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.140 align:middle line:84%
where we see the
empty panel here.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.110 align:middle line:84%
We see "The Mystic
Lamb" over here.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that an
investigation unfolded.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In the empty space was left
a note, written in French,

00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:57.420 align:middle line:84%
with the words, "Taken
from Germany by the Treaty

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of Versaille," a
reference to the fact

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that the Altar piece had
been returned to Ghent only

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.780 align:middle line:84%
a decade earlier after
having been moved

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.340 align:middle line:84%
to Berlin during World
War I. A photograph

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of the missing original
"Just Judges" panel

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.230 align:middle line:84%
was fortunately
taken, and a painter

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
was able to replace the original
in 1945 when he made a copy.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It was the Belgian
copyist Jeff Vanderveken

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.110 align:middle line:90%
who actually did that.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The theft of this
national treasure

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
rocked the country
of Belgium, which

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.780 align:middle line:90%
was already in a deep crisis.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The Depression in America
had made its way to Belgium.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Banks closed.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Their king died mysteriously.

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And Hitler was coming.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And this was just a real shock
to their national psyche.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.760 align:middle line:84%
At that same time,
the country was

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.340 align:middle line:84%
flooded with apparitions
of the Virgin Mary.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Mysticism was in the air.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:84%
The Bishop of Ghent then
received a ransom demand

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.210 align:middle line:84%
for one million Belgian
francs for the missing panel.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:84%
The thief, as a
gesture of good faith,

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.710 align:middle line:84%
returned the "John
the Baptist" panel.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And 11 ransom letters
later, Belgian authorities

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.510 align:middle line:84%
were unable to recover
the missing panel.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:84%
On November 25, 1934, the
thief, Arsene Goedertier,

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.830 align:middle line:84%
revealed on his deathbed
that he was the only one who

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:14.970 align:middle line:84%
knew where the
masterpiece was hidden

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and that he would take
the secret to his grave.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Goedertier told his
lawyer, Georges de Vos,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that "I alone know where
'The Mystic Lamb' is.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The information is in the drawer
on the right of my writing

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.630 align:middle line:84%
table in an envelope marked,
'mutualite.'" De Vos found

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.810 align:middle line:84%
carbon copies of the ransom
notes and an unsent note that

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:84%
said, "It rests in a place where
neither I nor anybody else can

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:42.110 align:middle line:84%
take it away without arousing
the attention of the public."

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So did Goedertier learn the
secret of the Mystic Lamb?

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Where is the Arma Christi,
these tools or implements?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I've said
here, in my view,

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe that what
Van Eyck was intending

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.830 align:middle line:84%
was to create a
meditative aid where

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:03.620 align:middle line:84%
we learn to connect the
dots within ourselves

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and experience this
shower of radiant light

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.590 align:middle line:84%
within our own
consciousness-- and that

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is the Arcanum of
"The Mystic Lamb."

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And now in Clare's
segment, "Beyond the Veil,"

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.470 align:middle line:84%
she's going to take us
deeper into the mysteries

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:28.050 align:middle line:84%
of "The Mystic Lamb," with a
special emphasis on the Golden

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Fleece.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: A mystic painting,
secret relics of Jesus,

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Nazis, unsolved theft--
this story has it all.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But the bit I like most
is the Van Eyck brothers

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:48.300 align:middle line:84%
intended this painting
to be a meditative aid.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:52.120 align:middle line:84%
He meant for us to insert
ourselves into the painting

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and to participate in the
hunt for the Arma Christi.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Jan Van Eyck was paid to do
this work by Philip the Good.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The mastermind behind
it was unknown.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck was a favorite of King
Philip the Good, king of France

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and founder of the Order
of the Golden Fleece.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:84%
In this portrait by
Rogier van der Weyden,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Philip is shown here wearing
the chain, or the order,

00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and a ring that appears to
bear the three-ring Chintamani

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.010 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The choice of the Golden
Fleece of the Georgian kingdom

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:43.360 align:middle line:84%
of Colchis as the symbol
of a Christian order

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.960 align:middle line:90%
caused some controversy.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:84%
The Bishop of Chalon,
chancellor of the order,

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:54.040 align:middle line:84%
identified it instead
with the fleece of Gideon

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.590 align:middle line:90%
that received the dew of heaven.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a reference to
the philosophical dew,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.940 align:middle line:84%
an alchemical
substance that emanates

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.560 align:middle line:84%
from the center of
the galaxy and is

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.560 align:middle line:90%
transmitted through the sun.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.770 align:middle line:84%
To the Israelites,
this manna from heaven

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:90%
was a celestial food.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:84%
This dew, says the
Zohar, is the manna

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:84%
on which the souls of the
just nourish themselves.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The Chosen hunger
for it and collect it

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
with full hands in
the fields of heaven.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Around 1546, Cosimo
de Medici was

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.590 align:middle line:84%
awarded the Order of
the Golden Fleece.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:45.890 align:middle line:84%
He is shown with the collar of
the Order of the Golden Fleece

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:90%
in "Apotheosis of Cosimo."

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Apotheosis means to deify, to
raise from a man to a god-man.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:90%
It is the secret of Arcanum.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
An angel crowns Cosimo
with an oak wreath.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Another angel holds the collar
of the Order of the Golden

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Fleece.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.950 align:middle line:84%
In Greek mythology,
the Golden Fleece

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is the fleece of the
gold hare or winged ram.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It just a symbol of
authority and sovereignty

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and plays a central role in
the story of the hero Jason

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.140 align:middle line:90%
and the Argonauts.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Jason about
to seize the Golden

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Fleece with the stern of
the Argo at the right.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Jason led the Argonauts,
a band of adventurers

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:47.950 align:middle line:84%
who set on on the ship Argo to
steal the magical golden fleece

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:84%
of the ram, which was preserved
in Colchis on the Black Sea.

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:58.420 align:middle line:84%
With the help of the gods
and the sorceress Medea,

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Jason was able to
take the fleece

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.650 align:middle line:84%
from a grove
protected by a dragon.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Here with Athena beside him,
he reaches for the fleece.

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:13.510 align:middle line:84%
On the Douris cup,
Athena is shown

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:19.010 align:middle line:84%
wearing her goat-skin aegis
bearing the Gorgon and a helmet

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:84%
bearing a winged lioness, and
is holding an owl and her spear.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:29.150 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Fleece
hangs in a tree.

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Jason is being regurgitated by
the dragon guarding the tree.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Peleus sent Jason to retrieve
the magical fleece of gold that

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.780 align:middle line:84%
had been created
by Hermes and kept

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:45.890 align:middle line:84%
in the grove of
Ares, the god of war,

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:49.530 align:middle line:90%
in the far-off land of Colchis.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.580 align:middle line:84%
The hero Jason and
fellow Argnoauts

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.830 align:middle line:84%
battled the guardian dragon
of the Golden Fleece.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:01.530 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is coiled
around the sacred tree

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:03.125 align:middle line:90%
from which the fleece hangs.

00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Athena wears this golden garment
in this incredible statue

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.970 align:middle line:84%
of her at the Parthenon
in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:84%
In 1482, the Medici
family commissioned

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Sandro Botticelli's painting,
"Pallas and the Centaur."

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
Athena wears a transparent gown
studded with diamonds, symbolic

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of the light body
or diamond body.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Is the light body
the Golden Fleece

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:38.580 align:middle line:84%
sought by Jason
and other heroes?

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it the light body
or star cloak of Jesus?

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:48.640 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists tell a fascinating
story about Athena and manna

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:57.426 align:middle line:84%
that will be helpful
to decode this Arcanum.

00:54:57.426 --> 00:55:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In the story, Zeus
had a headache.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Vulcan, the god of alchemy,
seeking to free Zeus

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:84%
from his headaches, smashes
his head with an axe.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.860 align:middle line:84%
This releases Pallas Athena,
the goddess of wisdom,

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.130 align:middle line:90%
from his skull.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Golden rain, manna,
falls upon her.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this mystical manna substance
the fleece of the Mystic Lamb?

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.310 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Manna is a celestial
substance with a list

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of supernatural qualities.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.540 align:middle line:84%
The immortal Melchizadek
gave it to Abraham,

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:45.510 align:middle line:84%
the patriarch of Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Moses conducted it from heaven
with his magic Arcanum staff.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites collected
it once it hit the ground.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:03.790 align:middle line:84%
In John 6, Jesus describes
himself as the bread of life.

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Starting in verse 27,
he tells his listeners

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:11.620 align:middle line:84%
not to labor for
food which perishes,

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:84%
but for the food which endures
to everlasting life, which

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:21.100 align:middle line:90%
the son of man will give to you.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:84%
In verse 47 to 48 is
written, "Most assuredly I

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:33.880 align:middle line:84%
say to you, he who believes
in me has everlasting life.

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I am the bread of life."

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Verse 50 to 51 is written, "This
is the bread which comes down

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:50.330 align:middle line:84%
from heaven that one may
eat of it and not die.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I am the living bread which
came down from heaven.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:57:03.120 align:middle line:84%
If anyone eats of this
bread, he will live forever."

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Manna is clearly a
cosmic substance.

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.580 align:middle line:84%
In "Earth Under Fire,"
astrophysicist Dr. Paul

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:16.270 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette proposes that Zeus
signifies the galactic core.

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.705 align:middle line:90%
Now that's very interesting.

00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:20.320 align:middle line:90%


00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Athena, who springs from
Zeus's head, he says,

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.040 align:middle line:84%
signifies the outburst of
cosmic rays violently emitted

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.010 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic center
during a starburst event.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Carried by galactic
winds, these rays

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.290 align:middle line:84%
pour through the sun
on their way to Earth.

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:46.230 align:middle line:84%
They bring organic
substances from the galaxy.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The Metropolitan
Museum of Art is

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:52.640 align:middle line:84%
home to Biagio
D'Antonio's "Scenes

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.690 align:middle line:84%
From the Story of
the Argonauts."

00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.510 align:middle line:84%
At the left, Jason is
charged by King Peleus

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.260 align:middle line:90%
to retrieve the Golden Fleece.

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Jason then mounts his horse
and consults the centaur

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Chiron on Mount Peleum, together
with Hercules and Orpheus.

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:18.330 align:middle line:84%
In the distance is
Jason's ship, Argo.

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:22.780 align:middle line:84%
In the second panel, King
Aetes and his daughters

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Medea and Cassiopeia meet
Jason and his companions.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.730 align:middle line:84%
At center, Jason plows
the grove of Ares

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:37.750 align:middle line:84%
where the Golden Fleece is
guarded while Orpheus lulls

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:44.300 align:middle line:84%
the dragon to sleep so that
Jason may steal the fleece.

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.320 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Fleece
hanging from the tree

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is strikingly similar to
the golden nebri of Osiris,

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:58.820 align:middle line:84%
discovered in 1922 in
the tomb of Tutunkhamun.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.790 align:middle line:84%
This calf skin or panther
skin hanging on a pole

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.275 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol of
Osiris' resurrection.

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.235 align:middle line:90%


00:59:08.235 --> 00:59:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The inwat or nebri
was sometimes thought

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of as a skin into which the
dismembered limbs of Osiris

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:20.820 align:middle line:84%
were placed by the god
Anubis and were re-membered

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:24.080 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of rebirth,
the cow being

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.890 align:middle line:84%
a typical maternal symbol
in Egyptian thought.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.340 align:middle line:84%
The resurrected or
re-membered Osiris

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is shown in his bright
white karassed garment.

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.800 align:middle line:84%
This means the two symbols-- the
garment of light and the nebri

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.850 align:middle line:90%
-- are linked.

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.890 align:middle line:84%
William proposes
the karassed garment

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is the same as
the Golden Fleece.

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is found in scenes
showing the resurrected Osiris.

00:59:56.790 --> 01:00:00.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:03.690 align:middle line:84%
At Deir el-Bahari on
Luxor's West Bank,

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:07.560 align:middle line:84%
we see this extraordinary
example, only

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.500 align:middle line:84%
this time it appears
to quite humorously

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:14.561 align:middle line:90%
have a Wi-Fi symbol at its top.

01:00:14.561 --> 01:00:19.390 align:middle line:84%
A related symbol is the
loaf of bread, or manna.

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:22.930 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, there
are numerous depictions

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:26.520 align:middle line:84%
of enigmatic loaves
being presented to kings.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.040 align:middle line:90%


01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
This celestial food was said to
heighten the pharaoh's powers

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of perception,
awareness, and intuition

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and was responsible for
an overall transcendence

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of personality to
the angelic state.

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.730 align:middle line:84%
As discussed in the
"Icons" episodes,

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the scenes on the walls were
magically active in two ways.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to make
permanent the action shown

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.940 align:middle line:90%
being performed.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.420 align:middle line:84%
If the pharaoh offered a
loaf of bread to Osiris,

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that loaf of bread
would continue

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
to be presented so long as
the representation belonged

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in this world and in
the world of the gods.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if one stood
before a figure of a god

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and uttered his name, a
portion of the divine spirit

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:27.570 align:middle line:84%
would animate the stone
and the deity's attention

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
would be upon the
speaker, upon his actions,

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and upon the hidden
thoughts of his heart.

01:01:36.570 --> 01:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
The principle agent of
Osiris's transformation,

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
says Dr. Charles Muses,
was the divine food

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
which, like some super royal
jelly could do for bees,

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
would stimulate
metamorphic neurosecretory

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.180 align:middle line:84%
organs in the human
central nervous system

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and enable a super-biological
process to take place,

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to mature a higher body
that can transcend at death

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and is capable of furnishing
a sensorium to perceive

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and function in a world
free than the transient

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
three-dimensional one in which
we are currently confined.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
This was the ageless promise
that the ancient Egypt

01:02:24.130 --> 01:02:26.270 align:middle line:90%
held forth most explicitly.

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:28.830 align:middle line:90%


01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
All this brings
us to a key point

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:33.990 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egyptian ethnobotany.

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Ingestion of the
sacred material was

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
designed not to
merely give a high

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
but to trigger and impel the
metamorphic process leading

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.703 align:middle line:84%
to ethergic transmutation of
human nature into apotheosis.

01:02:47.703 --> 01:02:50.290 align:middle line:90%


01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the Golden Fleece.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
This process was overseen by
cosmic regents, the living

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%
archetypes of stellar powers.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
To attain the awareness of
these star powers or beings

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
is the goal of Arcanum.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
As Muses points out,
we see three rays

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
or beams of star
power energy entering

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
the forehead of
the pupil Osiris.

01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, the
etherical quintessence

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
was represented in the form
of the five-pointed spar.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The word "spar" or
"star" also means door,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and with the
determinative for walking,

01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
it meant passing through
a star door, said Muses.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.585 align:middle line:90%
How about a stargate?

01:03:40.585 --> 01:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the Golden Fleece.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:53.272 align:middle line:90%


01:03:53.272 --> 01:03:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Arcanum."

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:07.515 align:middle line:90%
