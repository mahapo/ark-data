00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY:
What if you possessed

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:84%
a stone that could instantly
manifest all your wishes?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE HENRY: Today on Arcanum,
the Philosopher's Stone.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Arcanum, the
great secret or mystery.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The
dictionary says arcanum

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is the incredible
secret of nature,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that the alchemist
sought to discover

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
the Philosopher's Stone.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a most sacred
and powerful remedy.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: The great arcanum
was the most prized secrets

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.910 align:middle line:90%
of the Atlantean priestcraft.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
When the land of Atlas sank,
hierophants of the fire mystery

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
brought the formula to Egypt
where it remained for centuries

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in the possession of the
sages and philosophers.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It gradually moved into Europe
where its secrets are still

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:90%
preserved intact.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: History's greatest
heroes and villains

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%
have sought the stone.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Napoleon,
Constantine, Hitler, Saddam

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Hussein, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: For millennia,
the power elite villains

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and insiders of the world have
coveted, obsessed, stolen,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
spilled blood, and fought
over certain works of art

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and the secret facts
and esoteric knowledge

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:90%
that they conceal.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: That's why the
secrets of these works

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
have been for their eyes only
and lost to the rest of us,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
often hidden in secretive
locations or x places.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Talk of the secrets has been a
dangerous proposition for some.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Why?

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:90%
A conspiracy?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: To them this
information is theirs

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
and it's none of your business.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And for good reason.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:90%
The art is arcanum.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: It contains or conceals
sensational ancient esoteric

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, deep dark secrets
about the light and mystical

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that brings immense
power and finally peace

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:90%
to those who can decode it.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.405 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
real treasure of treasures.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Whether
the subject is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
the ark of the covenant,
ancient Sumerian artifacts,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the holy grail, alchemy,
miracles, ancient portals,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
or advanced ancient
technologies,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
angels, apparitions,
many great artists

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
have investigated these subjects
and discovered their secrets,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
usually on behalf of the most
powerful people in the world.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Often the art treasure
portrays miraculous events,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
such as the resurrection
of Jesus or beams

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:90%
of light coming from the sky.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Other times, it shows
portals to other realms.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Is it
possible the ancients

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
knew about portals or gateways
to the stars, immortality oils

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and other knowledge we're only
just beginning to apprehend?

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Let's find out.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
William's feature
investigation will take us

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
into the mysteries of
the rod and the stone.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.182 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: My
feature investigation

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:90%
is the rod and the stone.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The elusive
Philosopher's Stone has

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
been the holy
grail of alchemists

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
ever since ancient times
when the craft was first

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
devised in ancient India and
Egypt and China and elsewhere.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Transmutation is the basis of
this art, which is the ability

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to change one element
into a more valuable one.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
It has obsessed men of learning
and power for millennia.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical process
in its most basic sense

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be the
process of transmuting lower

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
forms into a higher or
perhaps a more pure form.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
The emerald tablet
is thought to contain

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
the secret of the
Philosopher's Stone.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It promises to link
one's consciousness

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:90%
with universal mind.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
It's attributed to
Hermes Trismegistus, who

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
is a Greek figure who's a
combination of the Greek god

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Hermes and also the Egyptian god
Thoth, the god of divine magic

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.074 align:middle line:90%
and alchemy.

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that
biblical scholars believe

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth is actually
the biblical figure Enoch,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
one of the most learned
men of the ancient world.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Hermes with
his primary symbol,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
the caduceus wand, the
staff of the alchemist,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:90%
the staff of arcanum.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And what we see here is
Hermes with his wand and also

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:90%
his winged sandals.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Hermes, like Thoth,
is considered

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:90%
to be the inventor of writing.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
He's the god of
letters and esoteric

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and especially
alchemical knowledge.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
As such, he was called
the mysterious one

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
or the unknown one.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Because of his
magical powers, he

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
was looked upon as a
physician of the soul

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and also the
messenger of the gods.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
With his magic staff,
he had the ability

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:84%
to conduct souls
between dimensions,

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
between the life on
earth and the afterlife.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So here in the
detail we see Hermes

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:90%
with his magnificent wand.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the rod or
staff of the gods

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
that all humans ultimately
want to get their hands on.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.755 align:middle line:84%
And in this illustration here,
we see Hermes with the rod

00:05:28.755 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
or wand conducting the soul,
here symbolized by a bird.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And also assisting this
other soul in its journey

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
into the afterlife.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
His symbol is the
caduceus wand as well,

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
which is almost always shown
with entwined serpents.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Many will be familiar with this
symbol as that of the American

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as the British
Medical Association.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Essentially the
entwined serpents

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
wind their way up a rod
that is topped by wings

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and is often illuminated.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:84%
When we look into
ancient art, we

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
will see Hermes with
his winged sandals

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and his cap of
invisibility-- let's not

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
forget that-- and
his other symbols.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's
in ancient Greece

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
or in Rome, where Hermes
is known as Mercury,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
he always has the same symbols.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
The familiar caduceus here,
cradling it in his arms.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Always with this cap
of invisibility as well

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and his winged sandals that
take him into other dimensions.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
He may have acquired
the caduceus

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
from the goddess Iris, the
goddess of the rainbow who

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is the feminine messenger of the
gods, who actually also nursed

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:90%
the baby Hermes.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So there is a feminine
component to this as well.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the male
gods that had this symbol

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:90%
or utilized this tool.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It's also the divine
feminine as well.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Iris, the goddess
of the rainbow.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:84%
A very key attribute that we'll
discuss again momentarily.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
In Rome, Iris was
called Juno, and she's

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
known as the goddess
of the rainbow.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was also, of course,
known as the feminine Hermes.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
With her rod or wand
she conducted souls

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The key piece of the
lore about Hermes,

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
though, is that he was known
as Thoth in ancient Egypt.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Thoth or Tahuti, as he's
technically referred to,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:90%
was the great initiator.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the temple walls
of Egypt you will often

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
see Thoth with his hand above
an individual, a pharaoh

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
typically, and he appears
to be beaming energy to him.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what he's doing.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
He's actually
attuning the pharaoh.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Thoth played a key role
in the afterlife ceremony

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
known as the weighing
of the heart.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.765 align:middle line:84%
What the ancient Egyptian
gods wanted to know

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:84%
was-- what they most
wanted to know about humans

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
was how light hearted
of a being were we.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they had in
the afterlife what

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:84%
was called the weighing
of the heart ceremony,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
where the heart of the
initiate was weighed

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
against a feather of
Maat, the symbol of divine

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
or cosmic truth.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so here we see the heart
of the initiative being

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:90%
weighed against that feather.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was is that
if the heart weighed

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
less than the
feather, then the soul

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
was allowed to continue on
its spiral of evolution.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
If it weighed more
than the feather, then

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
there was a recycling program,
this multi-faceted beast here.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the outcome,
it was the great Thoth

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.206 align:middle line:90%
who recorded that result.

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Here we are in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
in New York City where Thoth is
attuning the pharaoh by bathing

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
him in a spray of
the symbol called

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
the ankh or the key of life.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
We see the same thing
here from a temple wall

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
at Karnak in Egypt where
Thoth is joined by Ra

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're shown
basking Hatshepsut

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in a multi-colored ray of
ankhs, or a keys of life.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
They are clearly
attuning this goddess.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They are raising her vibration
with the symbol of the ankh

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:90%
or the key of life.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:84%
This is very
important because it

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:05.245 align:middle line:84%
begins to link the idea of sound
or vibration, a key to Thoth.

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Thoth's other primary
symbol is the baboon,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
the creature that
greets the dawn.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And here we see
the baboon holding

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
what's called the udjat
eye, the eye of perfection,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
which is a very important symbol
in ancient Egyptian arcanum.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's Thoth with
another god, Ptah,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
who is also known as a god
of smithcraft or alchemy.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And what we note
here is that both

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of the gods in this temple,
seen here from Abydos,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
hold rods in their hands.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:90%
This is our staff of arcanum.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the object of
the alchemical quest

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
to get our hands on
this all powerful staff

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:90%
of transmutation.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Featured here is Thoth with
his caduceus rod or wand

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:90%
and also with the key of life.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And what he's doing
here is actually

00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:84%
resurrecting the King Seti who
is portrayed here as Osiris.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Thoth is resurrecting him with
his caduceus rods and the key

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of life, once again uniting
the concept of the rod

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
or wand with the key
or tone or vibration.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:84%
What we notice in
the detail here

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the key is
being offered by Thoth

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and Seti is inhaling
the key, indicating

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that he is consuming
the key, he is actually

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
becoming this higher vibration
and it is transforming him

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to his journey
into the afterlife.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, beautiful
detail here.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can almost
inhale that key

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of life yourself just looking
at this extraordinary temple

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
image.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Something most people don't know
is that in early Christian art,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was portrayed similarly
to Thoth with his rod

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:90%
or wand in hand.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in early
Christian art, up

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
until about the fourth
century, whenever

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was portrayed performing
the miracles, whether turning

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
water into wine,
loaves into fishes,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:84%
or raising Lazarus from the
dead, he did so with a rod

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.960 align:middle line:90%
or wand in his hand.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity to
go to Rome to the museums

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
at the National Museum in
Rome as well as the Vatican

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:20.280 align:middle line:84%
to study the early Christian
sarcophagi that document Jesus'

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
use of a rod or a wand
just like that used

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:84%
by Thoth in ancient Egypt
and Hermes in Greece.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So here is Jesus,
several examples

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
from sarcophagi, of
Jesus using the rod

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.432 align:middle line:84%
or wand to raise
Lazarus from the dead.

00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:84%
There's something
very interesting.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is that when you add
the first letter L to the name

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, you get the name,
phonetically, the name Lazarus.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So here seems to be a
code or a key telling us

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps, indeed,
Jesus did acquire the rod

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:90%
or wand of Hermes or Thoth.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And in these scenes
here, we notice

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%
something very important.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is Jesus is
striking Lazarus right

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:90%
on the top of his crown chakra.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
He is awakening his
higher consciousness.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
This is because
technically speaking,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Lazarus wasn't dead in
that he was deceased.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Lazarus was not awakened
in his consciousness.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And after Jesus taps
him on the crown chakra,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
then Lazarus is now a
fully awakened being.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the Bible, is then

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
able to perceive the glory of
God, the light or vibration

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So these are extraordinary
historical examples

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of a continuous transmission of
arcanum, beginning with Thoth,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
coming into ancient Greece, and
now into early Christian times.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
This is an extraordinary
gold plate,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
a photo of a gold plate, a
photo that I took in the Vatican

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Museum in Vatican City,
showing Jesus raising Lazarus.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Here again raising Lazarus.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And on the bottom,
he's turning water

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
into wine with his rod
or wand of arcanum.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Was Jesus in fact
a divine alchemist?

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
These images make a case
that that is in fact so.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
In this instance here, he's
turning water into wine

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
as other disciples look on.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And he has his hand
on another figure

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
here, attuning or
initiating him.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, the rod is being used
to turn water into wine.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, water into wine and
raising Lazarus from the dead.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
In one of the earliest examples,
we turn to Santa Sabina in Rome

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
where we see these
magnificent cypress doors

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
where we see three examples
of Jesus using this rod

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or wand of arcanum
to awaken a figure.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
The Church of Santa Sabina
on the Aventine Hill in Rome

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:84%
is famous for the
cypress door which

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
may date to the
early fifth century

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:90%
when the church was built.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And one panel actually
contains a scene

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
that is generally regarded
as the first depiction

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:90%
of the crucifixion of Jesus.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.456 align:middle line:90%
Look at this here.

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's extraordinary.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no cross.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply Jesus awakening
and in a special prayer pose.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And back to using the wand or
rod to turn water into wine.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The loaves turned into
fishes in this example

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.540 align:middle line:90%
here from Santa Sabina.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done here is
made a direct connection

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:90%
between Jesus and Thoth.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the arcanum
we're talking about here.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the most highly
sought after secret

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
in all the ancient world.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
How can we awaken
our consciousness

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and connect ourselves with
universal consciousness?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.990 align:middle line:84%
How can we raise ourselves
metaphorically from the dead

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and, speaking literally, how
can we attain immortality?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise
of this rod or wand.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
In Jewish legend,
Jacob inherited a rod

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
or a staff that once belonged to
Adam in lore who brought it out

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Garden of
Eden with him, which

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.450 align:middle line:84%
means it has this ancient,
ancient pre-history.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
It once belonged to Enoch
as well as to Moses.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And in this painting
by William Blake,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
we see Moses with
that rod or wand.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
If you know your
Bible story, you

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
know that Moses used this rod
or wand to part the Red Sea.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.185 align:middle line:84%
He also struck a
rock with this wand

00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and caused water
to emerge from it.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Jacob, when he used
this staff, had

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:90%
an extraordinary experience.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
It was Jacob, of
course, who famously

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:84%
laid his head on a stone,
which must be the Philosopher's

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Stone, and saw heaven open.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The book of Genesis
tells us the Jacob

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
lays his head on this
stone, falls into a dream,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and sees a ladder
or stairway reaching

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.780 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens with angels
ascending and descending

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
on either side.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
earliest examples

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of the opening of a portal
in biblical literature.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask, what
was the role of the stone

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and what was the role
of the rod that Jacob

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:90%
is said to have possessed?

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Did he put these
two pieces together

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and open a portal
or gateway leading

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:90%
into the heavenly realms?

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
William Blake does something
very, very interesting

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
here when he shows the angels
ascending and descending

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:84%
on this spiral stairway that
leads right through the sun.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
What Blake is doing is riffing
on ancient Egyptian stargate

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:90%
metaphysics, as I term it.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancient Egyptians
believed that our sun was,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a sun tunnel, a star
tunnel, or to use a modern day

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:90%
term, a star gate.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So here we are uniting
the stone and the rod

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and opening a portal or gateway
that leads into the heavens.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
In angelic symbolism, the
trump represents the instrument

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:90%
that joins heaven and earth.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And in this alchemical
illustration,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
we see the ladder, now, with the
angels ascending and descending

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:90%
with a trumpet.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
blowing a key or a tone

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
into Jacob's consciousness.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:84%
Here's the idea of the key,
tone, or vibration emerging

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
once again that awakens
our consciousness

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and enables us to perceive
the ladder, stairway,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:90%
or stargate to heaven.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Today the instrument that
joins heaven and earth

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:90%
is called a wormhole.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%
And look at this.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Look at the shape of the
mouth of the wormhole.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a trumpet.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Then we go through the
throat of the wormhole

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and emerge through another
bell or trumpet shaped opening.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
the ancient stargate

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:90%
was in fact a wormhole?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Is that what these ladder or
stairway to heaven stories

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
are actually about?

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic text acquired
their present form

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in the first centuries
of our era in Alexandria.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:84%
This is when there was a
great confluence of knowledge

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
about transforming or
perfecting the human body

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:84%
preparatory to this journey
upon the stairway to heaven.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
These texts drew from all
the other books and texts

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that were stored at the
famed Library of Alexandria.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
The Royal Library of Alexandria
or the Ancient Library

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of Alexandria, as
it was also called,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
was described by many
as the largest and most

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
significant great library
of the ancient world.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Built by the
Ptolemies, it's thought

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to have stored between
200,000 and 400,000 texts

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%
from the ancient world.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:84%
It was situated in Alexandria,
which of course was named

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
after the founder, Alexander
the Great in Egypt.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Plutarch wrote that during his
visit to Alexandria in 48 BC,

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Julius Caesar accidentally
burned the library down

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
when he set fire
to his own ships

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to frustrate Achilles's is
attempt to limit his ability

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:90%
to communicate by sea.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:84%
After its destruction, scholars
used a daughter library

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
in the temple known
as the Sarapion, which

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
was located in another
part of Alexandria.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The Sarapion is named
after the god Serapis, who

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
was a later version
of the Egyptian god

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Osiris, the god of resurrection.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Serapis is often
portrayed as a bearded man

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
with the body of a serpent,
as he's shown here with Isis.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a drawing
that was actually

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
done by one of
Napoleon's artists

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:90%
when they invaded Egypt in 1798.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a sense
of what it must've

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
been like to worship Serapis
in the ancient world.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Theodosius was a
zealous Christian,

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and when he ordered the
image of Serapis or Serapis

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in Alexandria be destroyed,
the Christians there burnt

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the valuable library that
was housed in the Sarapion

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately those
texts were lost.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
But actually they
were disseminated

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
throughout Byzantium and
ultimately made their way

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:90%
into Europe.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
At the temple of Isis
and Herculaneum in Italy,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
we find two mural frescoes
that we're dating from 100 BC

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
to about 62 AD that portray
scenes in the worship of Isis

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:90%
by Alexandrian goddesses.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
This scene is called "The
Adoration of the Sacred Water"

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or the water of the Nile,
which was considered

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
to be an emblem of
Osiris or Serapis.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
What we see here in the
foreground are three alters.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The middle one with
the fire burning on it,

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:84%
which an attendant is
fanning, while on the right

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a flute player
seated on the ground

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
having in front of him a priest
with a wand in either hand,

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and on the left a man
and a woman shaking

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
sistra, an ancient
Egyptian instrument.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.207 align:middle line:84%
So here again we're linking the
idea of the wand with music.

00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to see once again

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
is the opening of a
portal or a gateway.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So here we see in the detail
the flute player on the right

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and the priest with
the wands beside him.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The music, it
seems to be opening

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
the portal or the
gateway and perhaps

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.935 align:middle line:90%
even activating the wand.

00:21:00.935 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Now that's an interesting idea.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So next we see a
staircase that's

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:90%
guarded by the two sphinx here.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Before the door at
the head of the stairs

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.550 align:middle line:84%
stands a priest with a shaven
crown of the Alexandrian

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
priesthood holding with both
hands an urn breast high.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
While behind him are two others
one of whom, probably a woman,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is completely clothed and wears
long hair and shakes a sistrum,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that ancient
Egyptian instrument,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
while the other is naked to
the waist and has his head

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:84%
shaved just like
the central figure.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
The central figure is Serapis.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And he's clearly
portrayed standing

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:90%
in a gateway or a doorway.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask the
question, is it possible

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that the flute player and
the wand bearer in fact

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
opened the door for
Serapis to emerge?

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, beautiful
illustration.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And here's the figure holding
a rod or wand or a sword,

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
rather, standing
before the stairway,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:84%
indicating that Serapis is at
a higher level or perhaps even

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:90%
an ascended level.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
On either side we see
a choir once again

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:84%
with initiates
singing antofitally,

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
or in two choirs, the hymn of
Serapis indicating that we're

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
once again opening the
portal or the gateway

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
through sound or
vibration, music.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The treatises that we now call
the corpus hermeticum, which

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
were derived from the
Alexandrian Library, which

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps the best
known hermetic work

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
were compiled
mainly in the second

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
to third centuries
of the current era

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and have been preserved
in Greek caduceus.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Although Coptic or Egyptian
Christian fragments

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
have also been recovered in
Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They were lost
originally until 1463

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.960 align:middle line:84%
when Cosimo de Medici financed
the search for arcanum.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
In 1459, Cosimo founded
a new platonic Academy

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
in Florence, Italy to revive
the Gnostic teachings of Plato.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The Corpus Hermeticum was
brought to Florence in 1460

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:90%
from Turkey or Byzantium.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It was translated by
Marsilio Ficino, who

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
was pulled from the project of
translating the works of Plato

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
to work on the all
important Corpus Hermeticum

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And here are some examples of
first editions of the Corpus

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticum as translated
by Marsilio Ficino.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Ficino realized that
Christianity was actually

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
a variation or an interpretation
of a group of followers

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Corpus
Heremeticum, specifically

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:90%
the cult of Serapis.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very powerful
information concerning

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
the Roman Catholic
Church was just

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.240 align:middle line:90%
then beginning to take power.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:84%
High priest physician,
musician, astrologer, Christian.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Marsilio Ficino was the
original renaissance man.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And in this floor mosaic, we
see Ficino in the left corner

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
with Plato standing
before Moses.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a very good
reason for this

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is because
Ficino and his successors

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
regarded Hermes Trismegistus
as a contemporary of Moses.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And his teachings were seen
as a philosophy of Perennis,

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
or a perennial philosophy
predicating yet

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
anticipating
Christianity by centuries

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
with its roots in
pharaonic Egypt,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
taking us all the
way back to Thoth.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And for Ficino, Jesus
was the exemplar

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate human
potential, our ability

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to attain resurrection
or what we now

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the glory
body, or indeed,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow body of light.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Ficino sought to fuse
Christianity with its roots

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:52.036 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt by linking Jesus
with Thoth and also Hermes.

00:24:52.036 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Ficino wrote extensively
about techniques

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.950 align:middle line:84%
whereby planetary powers
were to be invoked

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:84%
by the principles
of hermetic analogy.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the key
statements from the Corpus

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Heremticum which is, "As
above, so below, as within, so

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
without."

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And we might add, "as
then, as now," indicating

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:84%
that all essentially is one and
is happening at the same time.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Ficino believed that the human
soul originated in the higher

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.370 align:middle line:84%
world but is trapped in the body
in the lower world on earth.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And Plato's writings describe
the return or ascent,

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the ascension of the soul
to its true perfect home,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.710 align:middle line:90%
the unity of the one God.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Ficino wrote and performed
music, not surprisingly,

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that drew down or attracted
stellar influences, which

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
was referred to as the
music of the spheres.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This was possible
because the human soul

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is made of star
stuff, Ficino taught.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Ficino had previously translated
the neoplatonist Iamblichus,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:84%
who spoke about magical
practice of divine work,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
or theurgy, of purifying
the subtle or astral body

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.700 align:middle line:84%
through ritual
techniques to the extent

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:90%
that it became divinized.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Whilst the theurgist was still
alive and thus constituted

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle for his
return to the gods.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
here is divine work

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that enables us to
manifest the rainbow

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
body or the resurrection body of
Christ while we're still alive.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is controversial
because Christianity teaches

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that we will only be
able to accomplish

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:90%
this in the afterlife.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But Ficino and the
neoplatonists believed

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that we could even do
it while still alive.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And we notice Jesus here in his
resurrection or rainbow body,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
he holds the staff of
arcanum in his hand, which

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:84%
is featured in this
example as a cross.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body is
a Tibetan concept.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans believed
that the human body

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
was designed to be spun
into a vortex of energy that

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
ultimately manifests as
five colored rainbow light.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And once we attain this
resurrection or rainbow body,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
then we can travel the
cosmos as light beings.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
What we notice in this image
here of this Tibetan tonka

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:84%
is that the llama actually
also holds a staff.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So we know we're talking about
the staff or rod of arcanum

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
here, which its ultimate
manifestation is

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that of the rainbow body of
light or the resurrection body.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Now Ficino believed
that he could draw down

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the power of the
stars and planets

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
to aid in his
spiritual evolution

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
or attainment of the
rainbow body of light.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We are trapped on
Earth, he believed,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
as I said a moment ago,
and the only way out

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:84%
was to refine the soul and
ascend to the heavenly realms.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans teach
the same thing,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.230 align:middle line:84%
that the only way we ultimately
will be able to leave earth

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is by obtaining
the rainbow body.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But Ficino was willing to
go down the Christian path

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and say that Jesus
is the exemplar

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate attainment
of human potential,

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
our manifestation or morphing
into the rainbow body of light,

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:90%
which enables our ascension.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, this
process takes place,

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Iamblichus taught
and Ficino affirmed,

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
through the imaginative
power of the theurgist.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a very important
point because it tells us

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
that Ficino and the
others that he influenced

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:37.190 align:middle line:84%
were activating the power
of their imagination.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
key tools or instruments

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that they could use in
their ascension process.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.380 align:middle line:84%
One way to tap the
power of the imagination

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and open the door
of ascension was

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.480 align:middle line:90%
through music, sound, vibration.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
The other was through
the power of symbols.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The soul's language,
Ficino taught, is symbols.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Ficino taught that images
that point us to the source

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
could be created to
empower the imagination

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and thereby empower the
soul in its ascension.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Through engaging
with the images,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we actually can become
them, was Ficino's premise.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Chiefly cited as being his
follower and the man who

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
incorporated this magical
knowledge or astro

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
magic in his paintings
was Sandro Botticelli,

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
masters of the Renaissance.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
His application of this
methodology via paintings

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Minerva and
the Centaur, the Birth

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.080 align:middle line:84%
of Venus and the
Primavera, were all

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
commissioned by Lorenzo de
Medici, Cosimo de Medici's son.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.780 align:middle line:84%
All three paintings
deal with occult themes

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and represent the magical
practice of drawing down

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:84%
planetary influences
into images or paintings,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:90%
as outlined by Ficino.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It is known that for the
Primavera in particular,

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli directly consulted
Ficino and all three

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.270 align:middle line:84%
of these paintings
will be examined

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:90%
in detail in a separate episode.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's no wonder that
they are considered

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to be some of the
greatest master works

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
or most iconic paintings
in all human history.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's because they were
designed or created

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.290 align:middle line:84%
with the intention of
empowering the soul's ascension.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Switching gears in our
continuing discussion

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:34.050 align:middle line:84%
of the stone here, in
Hinduism and Buddhism

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
we learn that the Philosopher's
Stone is called the Chintamani

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Stone, or the wish
fulfilling jewel.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called this because it
manifests whatever one wishes.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:50.050 align:middle line:84%
The Chintamani Stone is
one of four relics that

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
came to earth in a
chest from heaven

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and is held by Bodhisattvas
or enlightened beings.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So here we see a
Bodhisattva with,

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
no surprise, a
staff in his hand,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.020 align:middle line:84%
holding the Chintamani Stone,
the wish fulfilling jewel,

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
once again uniting
the rod and the stone,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:90%
but now in the Buddhist context.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The idea here is that these
Bodhisattvas have the ability

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to access the deepest powers
of the imagination, the deepest

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:90%
powers of the soul.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And this power is symbolized
by the acquisition

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.870 align:middle line:84%
of this stone, the
Chintamani Stone.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Shown here is Ksitigarbha,
the earth store Bodhisattva.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.740 align:middle line:84%
With his staff he uses to
pound open the gates to hell.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So here we are again talking
about the rod or staff

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
as a tool or instrument that
opens a portal or gateway

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to another realm,
especially the afterlife.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.860 align:middle line:84%
He also holds in his hand
his Chintamani stone,

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
which is also referred to as
the pearl for illuminating

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:84%
all the various realms
of hell to benefit

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.600 align:middle line:90%
sentient beings trapped there.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's the role of
this enlightened being

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is to use the staff and the
stone, the rod and the stone,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to open a portal or gateway
for the sentient beings

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:84%
in this afterlife realm, and
in a sense, to free them.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is also shown
with a staff, the cross,

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
when he descended into
hell in those three

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:84%
days between crucifixion
and resurrection

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:84%
so that he could free
the righteous souls

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:84%
from Old Testament
times, including

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Abraham
and other figures.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Eve as well.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus also
possess the stone?

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
What exactly was that
stone that was rolled away

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.320 align:middle line:90%
from the tomb on Easter morning?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Could it in fact
have been a symbol

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Philosopher's Stone
or the Chintamani Stone?

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
In example after
example in Christian art

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.170 align:middle line:84%
we see Jesus with
his illuminated halo

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.520 align:middle line:84%
or nimbus opening the
portal or gateway to hell

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:90%
with his staff in hand.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have to imagine that
somewhere the stone is also

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:90%
present.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
This is Fra Angelico's version
of the story with Jesus holding

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:84%
the rod or staff in
hand greeting Abraham

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and other figures of
the Old Testament times

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:84%
as he frees them from
their bondage in hell.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to Buddhism, we see
the Ksitigarbha, supreme lord

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of the underworld, once again,
who is in a way an equivalent

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus in his role of
using the staff and the stone

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:84%
to free souls, especially
righteous souls,

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
from otherworldly
realms or limbo,

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:84%
enabling them to
complete their ascension

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and return to the source realm.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
to ask is that are

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
we talking about
here the opening once

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
again of a portal or a stargate.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Is the staff or rod in the
stone tools or implements

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:84%
that actually open
stargates into other realms?

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
What about the idea
of sound or vibration

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:84%
again in opening this
portal or gateway?

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the answered by
the Buddhists who teach that,

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to achieve illumination or
experience Buddha nature,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.489 align:middle line:84%
we must meditate on
the jewel and the heart

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of the golden lotus, which
is the Chintamani Stone,

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:90%
and chant om mani padme hum.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.239 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So here we are
once again linking

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:84%
the idea of sound or
vibration with the stone.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.560 align:middle line:84%
The jewel or stone
which is the Chintamani

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:84%
is also called the blue pearl,
as I noted a moment ago.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
So in Buddhist art we will
see the awakened ones,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:84%
the Bodhisattvas, in this
radiant portal or gateway

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
holding the blue pearl
or the Chintamani Stone.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The goal of meditation
in the Siddha practice

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
is to see this blue
pearl or this blue stone

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.052 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately to go inside
it and to merge with it.

00:34:55.052 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Within the blue
pearl or stone you

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:84%
will see the deity you
have personal devotion

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to, be it Ptah, Jesus, Buddha,
Sai Baba, Krishna, or Rama.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So here we are once
again holding the stone

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:84%
with the open portal
or gateway behind us.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, what we
see in Christian ascension art.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is ascending through
the blue portal or gateway,

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
indicating that he's traveling
into the divine realms.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And it could well be that
this blue orb he's riding on

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is a Christian symbol
for the Chintamani Stone.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
to me that Jesus

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
holds the ring of
sovereignty in his hand

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.520 align:middle line:90%
as well as a rolled up scroll.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So the ring unites us once again
with the stone and the scroll

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.655 align:middle line:84%
in a way could be
thought of actually

00:35:44.655 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:90%
as the rod or the wand.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
In this beautiful
alchemical depiction

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:84%
from the Divine Comedy
by Giovanni de Paolo

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
we see Jesus in the
blue orb surrounded

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:01.266 align:middle line:84%
by the ouroboros, the symbol
of the alchemical craft.

00:36:01.266 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So we know that what
we're talking about here

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
is that divine magic or
theurgy that Marsilio Ficino

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
spoke of and wrote so
passionately about.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And view Jesus, once
again, as the exemplar

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate human potential
to transform ourselves

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:84%
into rainbow body light beings
and ascend into the heavenly

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So a few more
examples here of Jesus

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:84%
ascending or transforming
with the open blue portal

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.580 align:middle line:90%
or gateway behind him.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
This one here from Egypt
in the 10th century where

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.240 align:middle line:84%
we see Jesus on the throne
with the blue rings behind him.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we see concentric
rings in a painting,

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember
it almost always can

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:52.940 align:middle line:84%
indicate sound or vibration as
well as a portal or a gateway,

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:90%
a vortex.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we're uniting the
idea of ascension with a portal

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and also with sound.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:84%
From the Hagio
Sofia we see Jesus

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in the blue orb of concentric
rings filled with manna or star

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
stuff descending
into the heavens.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem's Dome of
the Rock is described

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as an x place or a portal
or a stargate where

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.614 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly fire
meets the earth.

00:37:22.614 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it
would be valuable

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:84%
for us to take a moment
to go inside this most

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.140 align:middle line:84%
sacred dot of real
estate on earth

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and appreciate its
portal symbolism.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
There's another reason we want
to look into this sacred place.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
this location

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:42.330 align:middle line:84%
is marked by one of the most
profound locations on earth.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The Dome of the
Rock conceals what

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be the
most sacred stone or rock

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:90%
and dot of real estate on earth.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It is called the
Foundation Stone

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and is said to have
been planted here

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.280 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of
creation and taken

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.060 align:middle line:90%
by God from his throne of glory.

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Jews see it as the
center of the Earth,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
the axis of the universe, the
ladder or stairway to heaven,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
the connecting link that
joins heaven and earth,

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or the pivot that
joins heaven and earth.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And here is a beautiful painting
showing that Foundation Stone,

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the most sacred dot of
real estate on earth,

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
according to the Judeo
Christian tradition.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And here is a modern day
photograph showing the stone

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:84%
with the portal imagery
above it on the interior

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Dome of the Rock.

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:84%
This of course is
the location where

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.580 align:middle line:84%
the Jews had taken the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was also the location
of Solomon's temple,

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the permanent home
for the Ark, which

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.460 align:middle line:84%
was housed in the holy of
holies of Solomon's temple.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And inside the holy of holies
was the most holy place,

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:84%
this golden cube shaped room
where the Ark of the Covenant

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.260 align:middle line:90%
was located.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And here we see the
Israelite priests

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
carrying the Ark of the
Covenant in the wilderness,

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:84%
ultimately taking it to its
destination in Jerusalem.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And we see the divine
pillar emanating

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.910 align:middle line:84%
from the Ark of the Covenant,
indicating its purpose, which

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.390 align:middle line:90%
is to link heaven and earth.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:84%
What most don't realize is
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be the throne
of the Israelite God Yahweh.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible,
Yahweh is described

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:84%
as a luminous humanoid figure
with a rainbow-like energy

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.950 align:middle line:90%
around him.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
He's luminous, humanoid, and
surrounded in rainbow light.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's powerful because
it raises the question

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or possibility that in fact
Yahweh was a rainbow body

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:84%
being, which is very, very
strong statement to make,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:84%
but also tremendously
controversial

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
because most don't think
of the Old Testament God

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.590 align:middle line:90%
as being a humanoid figure.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And what we notice
in this painting

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.520 align:middle line:84%
by Carl Gutherz in the Library
of Congress reading room

00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
is that Yahweh on his throne
holds a stone in his hand.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And this stone is remarkably
similar in its symbolism

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and appearance and also
perhaps its purpose

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:90%
to the Chintamani Stone.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that we are
seeing yet another connection

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:84%
between the Buddhist
Bodhisattvas and the Old

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Testament God Yahweh?

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
Ark of the Covenant

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is the device upon which he sits
and it held several other tools

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.260 align:middle line:84%
or instruments, including
the rod of Aaron,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:84%
the rod of enlightenment,
the tablet or stones

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that had the Ten
Commandments written on them,

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.490 align:middle line:84%
a flask of manna as well
as a cruc of sacred oil.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So once again,
it's very possible

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
that the stone in Yahweh's
hand and the stone

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Bodhisattva's hand are
the same thing, the Chintamani

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:54.516 align:middle line:84%
stone, the wish
fulfilling jewel.

00:40:54.516 --> 00:40:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take
this one layer deeper.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we know from Buddhist
teachings as well as Christian

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:84%
teachings that all
of this actually

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:90%
happens inside our bodies.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's Jesus holding
the stone in his hand here as

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.560 align:middle line:84%
he's doing in this
painting by Fra Angelico,

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.410 align:middle line:84%
or it's Jesus in
this example here

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:20.150 align:middle line:84%
on his heavenly throne where
he's holding the stone,

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.860 align:middle line:84%
or in this example
here as a child where

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.830 align:middle line:84%
he's holding the
stone, which symbolizes

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:84%
universal power,
that all of these

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
represent something that
happens inside of us.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
In "Foundation Stone and
Jerusalem of the Mind,"

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:84%
author JD Bakst notes
that one of the names

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of the pineal gland in the
center of the brain which

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is under our dome in the
center of our dome, in fact,

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:90%
is the foundation stone.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.310 align:middle line:84%
This gland has long
been considered

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the gate through which the
soul enters and exits the body.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Now in 2006, scientists reported
that at close magnification,

00:41:57.430 --> 00:42:01.550 align:middle line:84%
calcite microcrystals were
visible on the pineal gland.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that the
stone in the center of our head

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:90%
is literally a stone.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It is a crystal.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And what these scientists
have discovered

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:84%
is that these crystals have
a piezoelectric properties

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
with excitability
in the frequency

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:84%
range of mobile
telecommunications.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.250 align:middle line:84%
They theorize that
the interactions

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
of these crystals
with global system

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.600 align:middle line:84%
for mobile
telecommunication waves

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.680 align:middle line:84%
could constitute a new
mechanism of transduction

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:90%
of the perennial membrane.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:84%
What this means
in layman's terms

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is that our pineal
gland is a cell phone.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The wireless transmitter
that we're all

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.410 align:middle line:84%
looking for that links us with
the universal consciousness

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:90%
is our pineal gland.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the stone within us.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And where does that stone sit?

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Right at the top of the
rod, our spinal cord system.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:84%
How's that for linking these
extraordinary concepts that

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.650 align:middle line:84%
are out here in these
paintings with what

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.030 align:middle line:90%
goes on inside each of us?

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're all learning to
climb this ladder or stairway

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to heaven and activate
or get the stone.

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Bakst sheds immense light on the
relationship between the pineal

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and the unusual river of life
giving fluid Ezekiel describes

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:84%
appearing in the inner
sanctum, the holy of holies,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:90%
of the temple.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It causes the stone to begin
releasing microscopic spirit

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:84%
molecules of living liquid
that Bakst proposes is actually

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:36.800 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a
natural but enigmatic substance

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:84%
generated by the pineal
gland that facilitates

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.920 align:middle line:90%
inner dimensional experiences.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that Marsilio
Ficino and Sandro Bottichelli

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and Plato actually knew
that our pineal gland was

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.620 align:middle line:84%
capable of being
activated by images

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as sound to open portals
or gateways into other realms?

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We now know that by consciously
stimulating and activating

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.470 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland, the
hidden and therefore

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.670 align:middle line:84%
black stone residing
within each one of us,

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
we cause the oil of heaven
to flow through our body

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.310 align:middle line:90%
and into our world.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is that oil
that ultimately

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.250 align:middle line:90%
transmutes our body into light.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:84%
In this amazing painting by
William West, he shows a head.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We see the nose
and we see the chin

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:84%
with the Ark of the
Covenant located exactly

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in the location of
the pineal gland,

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.990 align:middle line:84%
suggesting to me that
William West knew

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the
Covenant isn't out here.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not in Ethiopia.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:45.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the US Capitol in
Washington DC as some propose.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It's right here within us.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And the stone, the rod, the
oil is also within us as well.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And by meditating
on, contemplating,

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and focusing on these
images, according to Ficino,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.680 align:middle line:84%
we activate this latent
capability within us.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And now in this segment
of Beyond The Veil,

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Clare is going to take is
deeper into the symbolism

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.370 align:middle line:90%
of the rod and the stone.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: As we have
seen, the arcanum

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:84%
is symbolized by
a rod and a stone.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.820 align:middle line:90%
The rod is called the caduceus.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It is often shown topped by
a bird, thought to be a dove.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Few symbols have a tradition as
long and as rich as the dove.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It is the subject of this
edition of Beyond The Veil.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:49.378 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.378 --> 00:45:53.930 align:middle line:84%
The dove often represents
the divine and its use

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:84%
has been shared, adapted,
and reinterpreted

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.610 align:middle line:84%
across goddess
cultures and millennia,

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:90%
to suit changing belief systems.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.290 align:middle line:84%
In addition to its symbolism
for the Holy Spirit,

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the dove was a popular
Christian symbol

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.930 align:middle line:84%
before the cross
rose to prominence

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth century.

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.385 align:middle line:84%
In holy grail lore,
the white dove

00:46:18.385 --> 00:46:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is the bringer of
the holy stone, which

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:84%
is referred to in the Book of
Revelation as the white stone,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.200 align:middle line:90%
meaning pure stone.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The stone is the
Philosopher's Stone.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It will enable the initiate
to transmute their body

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.670 align:middle line:84%
into light to join
the other superhuman

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:84%
light beings in the land of
the living or the light land.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:84%
The dove is the symbol
for the arcanum.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:84%
In mythology, the caduceus
wand is the alchemical talisman

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.910 align:middle line:84%
or device that enables messenger
beings to travel back and forth

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.200 align:middle line:90%
from the realm of the gods.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.330 align:middle line:84%
It is the symbol of the
transformation or perfection

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of these star walkers
into pure beings of light.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The dove is considered
to be a symbol

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:84%
for a cosmic vibration,
a holy essence.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:24.050 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, says
Genesis 1, verses 1 and 2,

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:27.400 align:middle line:84%
God created the
heavens and the earth.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.890 align:middle line:84%
The Earth was without
form, and void and darkness

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.260 align:middle line:90%
was on the face of the deep.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit of
God was hovering

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:40.260 align:middle line:84%
over the face of the
waters like a dove,

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:43.620 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Babylonian Talmud.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Juan de Flandes shows
archangel Gabriel

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.990 align:middle line:84%
conducting the cosmic
essence of the Milky Way

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:84%
into the crown chakra
with the arcanum staff.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:00.110 align:middle line:84%
In this extraordinary
painting by Carlo Crivelli,

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
we see a beam of light
bolting out of a cloud.

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.420 align:middle line:84%
This cloud has often been
labelled a UFO and it does

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.150 align:middle line:90%
resemble a disk.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it
is a luminous cloud

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:16.330 align:middle line:90%
composed of concentric rings.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Following the beam, we
see a dove riding upon it.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Archangel Gabriel
tearing open a hole in heaven

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and anointing Mary with the
cosmic energy of the Milky Way.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It is significant that the
annunciation celebrates

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Mary's transformation into the
god-bearer or Christ bearer

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.680 align:middle line:84%
in this stunning,
stunning painting.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that
Mary's consciousness

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.760 align:middle line:84%
has been prepared to receive
this otherworldly light

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:57.900 align:middle line:84%
or vibration from this
otherworldly visitor.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Jan Van Ike shows the dove
hovering above Mary's head.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:05.860 align:middle line:84%
The blue sapphire
jewel on her forehead

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.530 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes her
awakened crown chakra.

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Does it symbolize the
Chintamani perhaps?

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.550 align:middle line:84%
William and I were in the
Vatican Museum not so long ago

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and took this
stunning photo of Mary

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.090 align:middle line:90%
being anointed by the dove.

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The dove appears to spray
her with a cosmic energy.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Again we notice the
concentric rings

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.360 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing a
portal or a gateway.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.540 align:middle line:84%
At the Pantheon we found this
delicious annunciation image.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the dove and the
spray of otherworldly light

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:90%
go together.

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Mary is surrounded by rainbow
light, the rainbow body.

00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Here we see archangel Gabriel
conducting the holy vibration

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.190 align:middle line:90%
into the consciousness of Mary.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The rod is the symbol of the
transforming alchemical power

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:90%
or arcanum.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.210 align:middle line:84%
The Metropolitan
Museum in New York

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:84%
houses Botticelli's
profound annunciation.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel speaks
from behind a wall

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.300 align:middle line:84%
that symbolizes the veil
separating dimensions.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Mary and archangel Gabriel's
delicate and transparent crowns

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.890 align:middle line:90%
suggest plasma.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the thin veil
between heaven and earth,

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.110 align:middle line:90%
perhaps?

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The British Library in London
houses Giovanni Pietro Birago's

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.630 align:middle line:90%
heavenly annunciation.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.895 align:middle line:90%
It is mouth watering.

00:50:51.895 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Her hand on the
arcanum book, one

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
can feel Mary's
nimbus pulsating.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:03.270 align:middle line:84%
In The Annunciation
by Barthel Bruyn,

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:07.780 align:middle line:84%
a female archangel Gabriel
conducts the Holy Spirit

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:84%
into the ear of Mary
with the caduceus wand,

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.720 align:middle line:90%
and Mary is illuminated.

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The story is told that painter
Barthel Bruyn fell asleep

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:84%
after beginning the painting,
and when he awakened,

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.550 align:middle line:84%
the painting was
miraculously finished.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Gabriel has clearly
taken the place of Hermes

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:35.600 align:middle line:90%
as the conductor of souls.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.720 align:middle line:90%
She even uses the caduceus.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Going beyond the veil,
we see that Gabriel

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:48.580 align:middle line:84%
is awakening Mary's
crown chakra.

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:54.031 align:middle line:84%
The third eye is the
location of the pineal gland.

00:51:54.031 --> 00:51:56.525 align:middle line:84%
Known as the seat
of the soul, science

00:51:56.525 --> 00:52:02.970 align:middle line:84%
has shown that the human pineal
gland is covered with crystals.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
what actually happens

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:11.780 align:middle line:84%
in her consciousness when
Mary receives the dove.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:84%
This is a fascinating
painting of The Opening

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Third Eye by
Mihran K Serailian.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It was commissioned
by Manly P Hall.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:28.890 align:middle line:84%
This painting of the head of
Minerva or Athena the Virgin

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.450 align:middle line:84%
shows in part of the
activities of the pineal gland

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary
body at the time

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.850 align:middle line:90%
of the opening of the third eye.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The kundalini fire
is seen rising upward

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:47.810 align:middle line:84%
through the spinal canal
into the shape of a dove.

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:52.120 align:middle line:84%
The pineal is shown radiating
a beautiful blue aura.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The golden light radiating
from the base of the brain

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:00.840 align:middle line:84%
at the nape of
the neck gradually

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.810 align:middle line:84%
increases in size and
intensity until it

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:10.050 align:middle line:84%
forms the nimbus or
halo of the goddess.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:13.940 align:middle line:84%
All who have pierced the
veil of the grail mysteries

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:17.240 align:middle line:84%
learn that the object
of the grail quest

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.850 align:middle line:84%
is to raise our inner
fire, the illuminating

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:24.410 align:middle line:90%
serpent of kundalini.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Up the spear or rod of the
power, the spinal column,

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the brain.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Upon reaching the pea sized,
pine cone shaped mystery,

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:40.460 align:middle line:84%
pineal gland, at the
center of the brain,

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:45.260 align:middle line:84%
kundalini's fire fuses
the pineal's brain sand

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and makes or manufactures
the stone of the wise.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.300 align:middle line:84%
This stone emits or
secretes an elixir.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The secretion of the ages
that anoints and purifies

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the body, transforming
it into a superhuman.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The dove plays a key role
in the baptism of Jesus.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Before he was
baptized, Mark refers

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:22.000 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus as from Nazareth of
Galilee in Mark 1 verses 9.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Whereas afterwards he is
referred to the Nazarene,

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Mark 1 verse 24,
suggesting a transformation

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:90%
at the time of baptism.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:39.020 align:middle line:84%
We see the dove once
again descending

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:43.890 align:middle line:84%
in concentric rainbow rings
symbolic of a vibration,

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:45.890 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The divine essence drips from
the rainbow, and the dove

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:55.810 align:middle line:84%
into the open crown
chakra of Jesus.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.900 align:middle line:84%
An angel stands close
by waiting to give Jesus

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:04.780 align:middle line:84%
his cloak, symbolic
of the light body.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Mark describes the baptism
in Mark 1 verses 9 to 10:

00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:13.590 align:middle line:84%
"And it came to
pass in those days

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus came from
Nazareth of Galilee

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and was baptized
of John in Jordan.

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And straightaway, coming
up out of the water,

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:29.240 align:middle line:84%
he saw the heavens torn open
and the spirit, like a dove,

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:32.050 align:middle line:90%
descending upon him."

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:35.590 align:middle line:84%
In Fra Angelico's
painting of the baptism,

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:41.520 align:middle line:84%
the dove emerges from an
opening in the heavens.

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.910 align:middle line:84%
In the baptism by Leonardo
da Vinci and Andrea del

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Verrocchio, we
see a radiant dove

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.820 align:middle line:84%
spraying Jesus
with divine light.

00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.290 align:middle line:84%
He wears a
multi-colored garment,

00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:56.440 align:middle line:90%
suggestive of the rainbow body.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:05.262 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.262 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: So gosh, Clare,
that was incredible.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.636 align:middle line:84%
We start out with
these paintings,

00:56:08.636 --> 00:56:12.830 align:middle line:84%
we see a stone and then
the rod and then we

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.530 align:middle line:84%
put the two together and we
realize, hey, wait a minute,

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the rod is within us
and so is the stone.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
In your Beyond the
Veil segment, I

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:84%
could just feel when
that dove is hovering,

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I can feel that spray
of light, and that's

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.540 align:middle line:84%
exactly what these artists
intended, isn't it?

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: It certainly is.

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:30.370 align:middle line:90%
It certainly is.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But you know, William,
what I find amazing

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is that across from
the beginning of time

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:40.870 align:middle line:84%
when all these incredible
masters did their paintings

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and they hid beautiful
symbolism in their paintings,

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:90%
who would ever know?

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And they lived, whereas
anybody uttering

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.740 align:middle line:84%
one word from their
mouths, they were

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.400 align:middle line:90%
burned at the stake as heretics.

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet the painters
got away with murder.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness they
did or we would not

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:07.730 align:middle line:84%
be able to learn
and see and embrace

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:12.230 align:middle line:84%
all the fantastic things that
are out there in the paintings

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:13.660 align:middle line:90%
that we've shown today.

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:14.860 align:middle line:90%
And there's more to come.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: There's much
more to come on Arcanum.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all for
watching this episode.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you next
time on Gaiam TV.

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: Bye bye.

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:31.134 align:middle line:90%
