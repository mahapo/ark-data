00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello,
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we're going to explore

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:84%
the Native American beliefs
known as the Path of Souls,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
which is a detailed geography
of the soul's journey

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
in the Milky Way
during the afterlife.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Dozens of Native American
tribes contributed

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
to the myths and traditions
of the Path of Souls.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
It is an exquisite
teaching that describes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the soul walking the west,
as the afterlife is known.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
On its path, the soul encounters
portals and wormholes,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
stargates, that lead to
immeasurably beautiful spaces.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
This exploration began for me
at the Bicentennial Mall State

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Capital Park in Nashville,
Tennessee, where I live.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
This 2,200 foot long
rod was built in 1996

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to commemorate the state of
Tennessee's bicentennial.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
It is the sister site to the
National Mall in Washington,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
D.C., but it could also be
the sister to Stonehenge.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, we looked at
Nashville's Parthenon,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and I noted that Nashville
has copies of two healing

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
temples from the ancient world.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the other temple.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary design
of this very special place

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is laser etched
into two red granite

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
monoliths at the temples
gate or entrance.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It looks like something
you'd see in Egypt.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some say the
design of the Mall

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:90%
looks like a UFO landing pad.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
These monoliths tell me
that the design of the Mall

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:90%
is extremely important.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, who goes to this
much effort and expense

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
we see this design?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You can see in the detail
in this line drawing

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
that this is some kind of a rod
or wand design, it's a pillar.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Looks sort of like an antenna.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.669 align:middle line:84%
One can also see it as
a hammer, which is funny

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's a pun on
mall, the root of mallet,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
a stick with a hammer.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Soon after the Mall was built,
I made a synchronistic discovery

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
by noticing that it bore
a striking resemblance

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to this quite
technological looking

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to drawing from a second century
Chinese manuscript of Mount

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Meru, the Buddhist cosmic
access, or the World Tree.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
As we look at these
diagrams we see

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
that both wands have
circular platforms attached

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to which is a tapering section.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
Meru drawing is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
a triangle, which
symbolizes the portal

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to Shambhala, a gate of
souls to the other world.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.790 align:middle line:84%
This legendary
kingdom is the center

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of a brotherhood
of light dedicated

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual
advancement of humankind.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha and
Jesus were believed

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to be sent from this lost realm
as messiahs bringing knowledge

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
of a higher consciousness
to our world.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
Nashville Mall diagram

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
are three stars in the
pattern of a triangle.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying that these
designs are identical, however,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:90%
the similarity is very striking.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this similarity
is purely synchronistic,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
as a conversation I had
with the park's architect

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
said he knew nothing
about Mount Meru,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and did not even see a
similarity in these drawings.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The Meru cosmic axis
is the Buddhist version

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
of the stairway to heaven, also
called the World Axis, World

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Pillar, World Tree, in eastern
beliefs and philosophies,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Meru is the center of the
world, or the connection

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
between heaven and earth.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
In other words, it's a stargate.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:10%
And it is upon this rod that
heavenly beings come and go

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:10%
from the celestial realms,
according to Buddhist belief.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, its apex,
the triangular apex,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the
gate to Shambhala.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
What the diagram
conveys is the idea

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:84%
of a rod or a ladder
upon which the Buddha

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and other enlightened
beings come and go

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
from the celestial realms.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
A manifestation of
one of these sites

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:84%
appears to be laid
out and growing

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the Tennessee
State Capitol in Nashville,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:90%
so I call it Stargate Park.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the original
name for middle Tennessee

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
was the Mero District, which
is just one letter away

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:90%
from the word Meru.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I actually discovered this
site and its similarity

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
to the Meru axis while
researching FDR's quest

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
for the Holy Grail in 1933.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
He, along with Henry A. Wallace,
FDR's two-term Secretary

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of Agriculture and their term
VP, and Nicholas Roerich,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
a world famous Russian
mystic and painter,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
reformed the archetypal
trio of the three wise men

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and sought evidence for
the second coming of Jesus

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and the secrets of the
holy grail in Mongolia.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Based on early Christian
art, mostly from the second

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
to fourth century, showing
Jesus performing the miracles

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with a rod or a
wand, I hypothesized

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that the grail they sought
was some kind of a tone

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
or force that was conducted
by a wand or a rod

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of antenna,
and that this force could

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
alter matter, or the
matrix of earth light,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:90%
and even perform miracles.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
FDR and his wise men were also
seeking the elusive Chintamani

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
stone that produces
the light body.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
The stone is in the
casket in this painting

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:90%
by Nicholas Roerich.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
The Chintamani, or
wish-fulfilling jewel,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.486 align:middle line:84%
is a stone or a tone that
is symbolized by three dots.

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And this stone was
hidden in Shambhala

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.270 align:middle line:90%
where Roerich went to seek it.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
One among a handful
of letters written

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
by Henry Wallace
to Nicholas Roerich

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
during the course
of the expedition

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
led me to Nashville
as the place where

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.432 align:middle line:84%
they were going to
return their secrets,

00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
but we'll save that
for another story.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
In its simplest form,
the Nashville site

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
is a rod or wand topped by
three stars, sitting on a box.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
It so happens that the flag
of the state of Tennessee,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
the three stars of the flag
of the state of Tennessee,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
symbolize the three
divisions of the state.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But mystically,
symbolically, they

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the three
dots of the Chintamani.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So as I say, I dubbed
the Mall Stargate Park,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and began taking
people on guided

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
walks of this very unique site.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that each
of the seven chakras

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
are marked with appropriate
symbolism all by chance.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It literally is a temple of man.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to look
me up to come to Nashville,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.541 align:middle line:84%
we can take a walk
together, and I'll

00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
show you the secrets hidden
in plain sight in this very

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:90%
powerful place.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's use of red
granite is an example

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian temple
building technology.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The pillars that compose what's
called the Court of Three Stars

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
have bells in them, making
this wand a musical instrument.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
These pillars are ringers for
those found at Karnak in Egypt.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Oak trees line the
path to the Court

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of Three Stars, which
corresponds by the way,

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:90%
with the third eye.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The oak groves makes this pillar
an Asherah, the holy grove

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The Court of Three
Stars, as I say,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.255 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the third
eye or sixth Chakra.

00:07:46.255 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It is composed of 50 25 foot
tall stone pillars with bells

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and has the tri-star symbol
etched into its granite floor.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
this, is that in the Bible,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
a circle of upright stone such
as this is known as a gilgal.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
This was the name of the
place where Elijah ascended

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
into the heavens in a whirlwind
while 50 prophets witnessed it.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the most incredible
aspects of this site

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:90%
is its ancient history.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Most Nashvillians are
unaware of the city's

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:90%
provocative ancient history.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually a stone
inscription at the Mall site

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
tells us that this
site is sacred,

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
as it once was a
Native American burial

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
site where mass numbers of
bodies have been interred.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
The original
inhabitants of Nashville

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
built a mound nearby where
sacred ceremonies were held.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
This means, in ancient
times, Nashville

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
was called a Necropolis,
a city of the dead.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know what you
think when someone tells you

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that mass numbers of bodies
were buried at a place,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:84%
but it sounds like a
lot of people, maybe

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:90%
thousands of people, right.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered for a very
long time just how many people

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2012, I was
fortunate enough

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to meet Dr. Arthur Cushman,
a Nashville neurosurgeon who

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:84%
had spent over 35 years studying
the Native American beliefs

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
of those who lived in Nashville,
and collecting artifacts

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:90%
from ancient Nashville.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cushman is a noted expert on
Mesoamerican Shamanic beliefs.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
He told me that the
number of bodies

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
buried underneath
the city of Nashville

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:90%
was over 75,000 bodies.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Recently though, he told me that
state archaeologists have now

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
claimed the number may be as
high as 300,000 bodies buried

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in Nashville because of its
ancient sacred significance.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
This puts ancient Nashville
in the same league as Abydos,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, also known as
the Gate of Osiris,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
where thousands
of Egyptians were

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
buried in await of judgment
day and the opening of Orion's

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:90%
gate.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful to Dr.
Cushman for filling

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
in this detail about
the Stargate Park site,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
but that's not all
he illuminated me on.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
More, he told me that ancient
Nashville was a teaching

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and ceremonial center where
1,600 to 2,000 years ago

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Native American
Shamans taught what

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
was called the Path of
Souls, which wait for it,

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
describes the
journey of the soul

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
through a stargate in the
three belt stars of Orion.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a new
age theory, this

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is scholarly research
and evidence collected

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:90%
from Native American Shamans.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:10%
And like the ancient
Egyptians, this research

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:10%
reveals that the Native
Americans in Nashville

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:10%
believe that Orion was
a portal for souls.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
This sent my head spinning
about the significance

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Nashville and the
reappearance of these ascension

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%
temples.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It goes a long way
towards explaining why

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Nashville has these temples.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
In his book, The Keys of
Enoch, Dr. J.J. Hurtak

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
channeled Enoch, the ascension
prophet of the pre-flood world,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and Enoch identified
Nashville as one

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
of 12 centers that ring
the planet like a pearl

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
necklace of sacred sites.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cushman's insight
lent tremendous credence

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
to this idea.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And if that wasn't
incredible enough,

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cushman next
showed me something

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%
that absolutely blew my mind.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is, the symbol for
the path of soul's teachings,

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.563 align:middle line:84%
he said, is the triskula,
the triple spiral seen here.

00:11:47.563 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
The triskula is a neolithic
symbol adopted by Christianity

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol of the
Trinity, but it also

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:84%
appears on Native American Path
of Souls art from Nashville.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
When Dr. Cushman
showed this to me

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:90%
I could hardly believe my eyes.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because
it's exactly the same

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
as the Tibetan
wheel of joy symbol

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
which is the symbol for the
great perfection or rainbow

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:90%
body of light teaching.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And it had me thinking that
what we're dealing with here

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
is a variation of
the triple dot,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
or triple ray symbol
of the Chintimani stone

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that the Tibetans say
produces the light body

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:90%
of the perfect man.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
As a symbolist, I know
that the same symbol often

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
has the same meaning
in different cultures

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
over millennia.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:10%
The appearance of this
symbol on artifacts

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:10%
from ancient Nashville made
me wonder if it were possible

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:10%
that some form of rainbow
lightbody teaching

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:10%
was in fact taught
in ancient Nashville,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:10%
and if in fact this was part
of the Path of Souls teaching.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
This system and
the mounds where it

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
was taught throughout
Tennessee and the Ohio Valley

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and out into the western regions
assisted Native Americans

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
in their after death
journey into the stars.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's tantalizing to
think about what secrets may

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:90%
be still buried in my backyard.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Researchers believe that
the Path of Souls teaching

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
was paleolithic in origin
and actually originated

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
in the stars, being
a universal teaching.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It was first gathered
in the late 1800s

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
by representatives of the
Bureau of Native American Indian

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Affairs, who interviewed Shamans
and medicine men from dozens

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:90%
of Native American tribes.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Their stories and legends
of the soul's ascent

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
were gathered into a
massive collection of books.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:10%
Then, in the 1960s, Alabama
scholar George Lankford

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:10%
began collating these
teachings and discovered

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:10%
a thread running through them.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
The Path of Souls
model was recovered.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Like the ancient Egyptians,
the Native Americans

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
have a most beautiful
conception of what

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
we call death, the dissolution
of the physical body.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a mere transition,
or morphing,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:84%
of our real self to
other and wider arenas

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%
of life and consciousness.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness then does not
die, but endures as part

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:90%
of the unity of all life.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:84%
The relationship of
all living creatures

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
as kindred beings
moving in association

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:90%
through the great tree.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Contemporary Chippewa
medicine man, Sun Bear,

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
extends the native
perspective of death.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Since life is
movement, but movement

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that is cyclical and
non-linear, physical death

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more than a change
of both worlds and forms

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
because it is a circle from
birth to death to rebirth.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So native peoples'
acceptance of the fact

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of human rebirth, or
reincarnation, on Earth

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
is pervasive and shapes their
conception of life or death.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Our goal on the Path
of Souls, though,

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.570 align:middle line:84%
is to have an awake
life, an awake death,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and an awake rebirth
in the Milky Way.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
In 2015, Andrew
Collins and Greg Little

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
published their
book Path of Souls,

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
which is a very good
summation of this teaching.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
My own work is found in my
2013 book, The Secret of Sion.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
According to Collins and Little,
two star systems in particular

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
were central to the Path
of Soul's teaching, Orion

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and Cygnus, the Swan, which
the Native Americans imaged

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
as a turkey, falcon,
eagle, or turkey vulture.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.810 align:middle line:10%
Elsewhere, Collins
has demonstrated

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:10%
some very provocative findings
and happenings relative

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:10%
with Cygnus that
may point to proof

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:10%
of an advanced extraterrestrial
civilization living there.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:84%
The Native American
tribes saw Orion

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
as a severed hand with the
three belt stars as the wrist.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
The hand was seen as
hanging downwards with what

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:90%
resembles an eye in the palm.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Through this
mysterious eye, which

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:10%
is viewed as an ogee, a split in
the fabric of reality or space

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:10%
time, the soul of
the deceased person

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:10%
was able to gain entry
into the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But this Native
American conception

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
gets me really excited because
the ancients are clearly

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:90%
describing Orion as a stargate.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
After taking a journey
to the western most

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
edge of North America,
says this teaching,

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the soul would wait
for the hand of Orion

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to reach its lowest
point on the horizon.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Then, the soul would take
a leap through the portal

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in Orion's gate, specifically
through the fuzzy

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
egg shaped nebula, M 42,
located on the sword of Orion.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Once on the great river
of life the Milky Way,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
the soul then journeys along
a path, the Path of Souls.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers in 2004 pointed
the Hubble Space Telescope

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in an empty patch of sky
in the direction of Orion.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.890 align:middle line:84%
During 11 days and 400
complete orbits of Earth,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
they opened the shutters
of the telescope

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
and photographed over 10,000
galaxies, shown animated here.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Each one with
hundreds of billions

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
of stars and probably
that many souls.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.990 align:middle line:84%
This animated
version of this image

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
represented the farthest we had
ever seen into the universe.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
soul's original garden

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.950 align:middle line:90%
as it walks the west.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
At the core of the Path
of Soul's tradition

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
is a belief in reincarnation,
a belief in an adversary

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
encountered on our soul's
path into the afterlife

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and a belief in
a tree polar axis

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that connects the three worlds.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
According to Native American
belief, humans have two souls.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
One of these souls is
attached to the body,

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and is called the life soul.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
The other is called the free
soul, which is our true soul.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It is the soul we most
closely identify with.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
At the time of death, the
free soul leaves the body

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
but stays close for a time
before it begins its journey

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:90%
along the Path of Souls.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The free soul comes to a stream
which cannot be forded or swum

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:84%
because ghosts
cannot cross water.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It must be crossed
over, and they

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
tell us there is
a log bridge, some

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
say it's really a serpent,
which can be induced to fall

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:90%
across the chasm, or gap.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
This task must be accomplished
by the free soul and the bridge

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.750 align:middle line:90%
traversed to safety.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Lankford says some peoples
think the bridge is really

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
a way of talking about
the portal, or Stargate,

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and place it at that point in
their account of the journey.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, either before
or after the bridge,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
there is a ferocious dog
which must be dealt with.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
If the free soul
does so successfully,

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%
then the path lies open.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
One thing that the Native
American Path of Souls teaching

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
says is that if you
are ever cruel to a dog

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
during your earthly
life you're going

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to have a real serious
problem crossing this bridge,

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
the dog will not let you pass.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
There may be a camping place
for the free soul on the shore

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
we're told, for
there may be a wait

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
time until conditions are just
right to continue the journey.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
By most accounts, it is a
realm much like the earthly one

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that's left behind, but some
describe it as a river of light

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
with free souls
camped beside it.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
What the free soul must
do to continue the journey

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to the realm of the
dead, which is actually

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
greater life in the Milky Way,
is to make a terrifying leap.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The realm of the dead
is far to the south

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and it can only be
reached by walking

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the Path of Souls, the Milky
Way, across the night sky.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
To get to the path, however,
one must leave the Earth disk

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and enter the celestial realm.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Once the free soul has
entered the celestial realm,

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the Milky Way, the Path of
Souls stretches out before it.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
As in the ancient
Egyptian ceremony

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
of the weighing of the heart, if
the soul is judged to be pure,

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it's allowed to continue its
journey across a log bridge

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:90%
that leads to the afterlife.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Here the Path of Soul's teaching
says the lucky soul rejoins

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
its ancestors and
other celestial beings

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
who have graduated
Earth life, so to speak.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
But if the soul is found
to be impure or sinful

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
it is sent back to
Earth for reincarnation,

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
or possibly is annihilated
and ceases to exist.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Lankford believes
that the Path of Souls

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
is not a poetic metaphor,
but a literal understanding

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:84%
of the relations of humans
to the sky and the afterlife.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
The reason it is important
to learn the Path of Souls

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
is because it provides an
explanation of our soul's

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
location and the status of
souls before and after life,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and the proper procedures
for making the transition.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
These are much more than
intellectual questions

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
for every relationship and
every psychological attitude

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
towards the cosmos
itself are based

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.260 align:middle line:84%
upon our belief in
the fate of our souls.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
So the question now turns
to, from where did the Path

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.020 align:middle line:90%
of Souls idea originate?

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Like other ideas about the soul,
is this a self evident truth,

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
or is it possible that
messengers from the stars

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
delivered this
knowledge to Earth?

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
If so, were these
travelers from Orion?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egyptian belief, at
death, the soul of the pharaoh

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
was transformed
into the god Osiris,

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.980 align:middle line:84%
the Lord of Resurrection,
and the Lord of Orion.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
According to this belief,
codified in the Pyramid Texts,

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and dating to 2100
B.C., the pharaoh

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
ascends to the three
belt stars of Orion

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
where it gained access
to a portal leading

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
to the winding waterway
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I have proposed that
this is a wormhole

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and that what we are
seeing in these vignettes

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
Egyptians, especially

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient Egyptian
Book of the Dead,

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is the journey of the soul
along the Path of Souls.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
In this vignette,
we see the throne

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
of Osiris attached to the
ark, or bark, of the millions

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
of years, also known as
the boat of Wennefer,

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the perfected one, symbolized
as a dual headed serpent.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Mounted atop it is a stairway
to heaven, or a throne.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It is moored in a channel
of water at the bottom.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It then arises
out of the waters.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:84%
The stairway to heaven
symbolizes its connection

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
to resurrection and indicates
its power of flight,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:90%
or ascension.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
To me it's obviously a
symbol for a wormhole.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Next, the Ark travels through
several hierarchical zones

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:84%
until it reaches the top level,
called the field, or Dimension

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
of the Blessed, which
is not located on Earth.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It is the divine or celestial
realm, or field of heaven,

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
it's the Milky Way, or
what the Native Americans

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:90%
call the Path of Souls.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
In Message of the Sphinx,
Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
write, "one of the most
salient features of the Duat,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:84%
or the afterlife,
as it is described

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Egyptian
texts, is its relationship

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to a great cosmic river
called the Winding Waterway."

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Several studies have confirmed
beyond any serious doubt

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that the Winding Waterway
was the magical band of light

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
meandering across the sky that
we know of as the Milky Way.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The great arcing
sky goddess Nut can

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:84%
be seen as the Milky
Way, the Path of Souls.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
In this vignette, the
pharaoh is seen beneath Nut

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.695 align:middle line:90%
on his ship of eternity.

00:24:21.695 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, Nut can be
seen as the Path of Souls.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The feather on
the pharaoh's knee

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:84%
indicates his heart has been
weighed and his heart is pure.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And now his soul is peacefully
sailing into the Milky Way

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:90%
through an ogee.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
or a rip in the
fabric of space time.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
The ancient priest
astronomers of Egypt,

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
who compiled the
Pyramid Texts, did

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:84%
so to assist the King in the
process of his transfiguration

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
into a divine being,
a light being,

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
providing knowledge
and also magic power

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to the King in his journey
into the afterlife.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Rising from the sarcophagus,
the resurrected King

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
would make his way out
of the pyramid tomb

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and begin reading the
hieroglyphic text inscribed

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:90%
on the walls along the way.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And these texts would assist
him in his transfiguration,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:84%
or his spiritualization,
into a light being

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.932 align:middle line:84%
in his preparation for
entering the wormhole.

00:25:23.932 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:10%
Author Laird Scranton has shown
that the Egyptian hieroglyph,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:10%
to tear, resembles a pair
of thongs and a wormhole.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:10%
As the soul transcends the
body in Egyptian scheme,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.610 align:middle line:10%
it is reborn as a light being
and enters a celestial light,

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:10%
resembling a hollow
reed or a tube of light.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It has entered a
wormhole and will now

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:90%
ride that boat to heaven.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:10%
Utterance 264 of
the Pyramid Texts

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:10%
says, "the dead King
fairies across the sky

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:10%
to join the sun god."

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The King is enthroned
in his blue ascension

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:84%
sphere in this image and has the
apse of the soul in his hand.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid Texts continue, "the
winding waterway is flooded.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The field of rushes
are filled with water

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and I am ferried over
there on to yonder

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
eastern side of the sky, the
place where the gods fashioned

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.270 align:middle line:90%
me, Orion's sister Osiris.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I have come to my
waterways, which

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
are in the bank of the flood
of the great inundation,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to the place of contentment,
which is on the horizon.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
May you lift me and raise me
to the winding waterway, may

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:84%
you set me among the gods,
the imperishable stars."

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.120 align:middle line:84%
In clear language,
able to be interpreted

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
by the Path of Souls
teaching, the Pyramid Texts

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.140 align:middle line:84%
are telling us
these scenes portray

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
the transfigured
pharaoh navigating

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:56.010 align:middle line:84%
the celestial river, the Milky
Way, or the Path of Souls.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The destination is
the place of creation,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:03.210 align:middle line:84%
where the gods
fashioned me, or Orion.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.570 align:middle line:84%
The light chip is the vehicle
upon which the pharaoh travels.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It could easily be the
source of the imagery

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:90%
for the throne of Yahweh.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian
knowledge that Orion

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.430 align:middle line:84%
is a gateway to
the Path of Souls

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
is also encoded in
the Old Testament.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
In a pivotal moment
in the Old Testament,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Jacob laid his head
on a stone at a place

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
called Luz and went into a
deep sleep and began to dream.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:90%
His dream was profound.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
He saw a ladder set on the
Earth with its top reaching

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:90%
into heaven.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And behold, angels
of God, the Elohim,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
were ascending and
descending on it.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
El, or Yahweh, stood at
the top of this ladder.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Upon awakening Jacob proclaims,
"awesome is this place."

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, powerful is this place.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:84%
This is none other
than the gate to God

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and this is the gate to heaven.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.370 align:middle line:84%
In the morning,
Jacob took his stone

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that he had put under his head
and set it up for a pillar,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:90%
and poured oil on the top of it.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
He called the name of that
place, Bethel, or House of El.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, Jacob had a
stargate experience.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, the three
belt stars in Orion's belt

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
are called Jacob's
staff, and the Milky Way

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:90%
is termed Jacob's Ladder.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
As I said, Orion is also Osiris
to the ancient Egyptians.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So did Jacob's stargate take
him through the portal of Orion?

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Did Jacob have a trial run of
his ascension in this dream?

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Opinions and
interpretations vary

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
concerning the Elohim,
however, in our quest,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
their most impressive and
pertinent characteristic

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is their ability to travel
between the immaterial

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.250 align:middle line:84%
spiritual plane and
the world of matter,

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and their mission to assist
humans in their ascension.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The ancient idea of a
stargate above Orion

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:84%
was also proposed by
Adrian Gilbert in The Mayan

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Prophecies.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
He cites a short passage
from Giorgio de Santillana

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and Hertha von Dechend's
"Hamlet's Mill."

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
In the chapter
called, The Galaxy,

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.770 align:middle line:84%
they refer to the ancient idea
expressed in the Macrobius

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Commentaries on the
dream of Scipio,

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that between lives men's
souls dwell in the Milky Way.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
The gateways which their
souls pass in and out of life

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:84%
were they said,
that the two points

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
in the sky where the ecliptic
crosses the Milky Way.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
One of these gateways is in
the constellation of Gemini,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:84%
actually above Orion, and
the other between Scorpio

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and Sagittarius.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the location
of the galactic center.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, I am fascinated
by the beliefs the Seventh-day

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Adventists have for Orion.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1850s, Adventists
have cherished a belief

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:84%
that Orion is a hole, or
opening, to the throne of God,

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and that Jesus will
return through it.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Adventists reason that
the biblical references

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to heaven being opened,
in the Book of John

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and also the Book of Revelation,
and to the new Jerusalem

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
descending, were
referring to events

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that would occur in one location
in the sky, the middle star

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:90%
of Orion's sword.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
From what part of heaven will
this glorious city appear?

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
From where the flaming
sword is guarding

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:90%
the way of the tree of life.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:90%
In other words, Orion.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
In the New International
Version of the Bible,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
the opening of a hole in heaven,
the wormhole tube of light,

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is directly connected
to Jesus, who

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:84%
is referred to as the Son of
Man and a stairway to heaven.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:84%
"I tell you the truth, you
will all see heaven open,

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and the angels of
God going up and down

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
on the Son of Man, the one who
is the stairway between heaven

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.460 align:middle line:90%
and earth," says John 1:51.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Acts says Jesus will
return the same way as he came.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:84%
This tells me that the Path
of Souls is a two-way journey,

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and the journey itself
is characterized by some

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.110 align:middle line:84%
encounters with important beings
who live on the Path of Souls.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And while there is disagreement
on the number and nature

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:84%
of the encounters
and beings, there

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
is wide agreement
on two symbols.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about those symbols now.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The two symbols are
the eye and the hand,

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and also there is the
great serpent, referred

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
to as the winged serpent
that lives beneath the world

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and in the sky.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In Moundville, Alabama,
ceramic vessels

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.570 align:middle line:84%
were found that featured
five images that

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.640 align:middle line:90%
seem closely related.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Hand and eye, skull bone,
winged serpent, and raptor.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Of the five, the hand and
eye and winged serpent

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:90%
were the most frequent.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The five symbols
illustrate a complex

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs regarding the
death of human beings

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and the Path of Souls.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Underlying them is
the understanding

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Milky Way as the path on
which the souls of the deceased

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.060 align:middle line:90%
must walk.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Recalling the motif
of the eye in the palm

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.770 align:middle line:84%
of the compassionate
Bodhisattvas,

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell has written
about this incredible stone

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.080 align:middle line:90%
disk from Moundville, Alabama.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
He writes that interpreted
in Oriental terms,

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:84%
its central sign would be said
to represent the fear banishing

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.640 align:middle line:84%
jester of a Bodhisattva
hand showing on its palm

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the compassionate
eye of mercy, pierced

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:84%
by the sight of the
sorrows of this world.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The framing pair
of rattlesnakes,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.200 align:middle line:84%
like those of the
Aztec calendar stone,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.490 align:middle line:84%
would then symbolize
the Maya power

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
binding us to this
vortex of rebirths,

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and the opposed knots would
stand for the two doors east

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and west of the ascent
and descent, appearances

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and disappearances of all
things in the endless round.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, writes
Campbell, the fact

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that the eye is at the
center of the composition

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:84%
would suggest, according
to this reading,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
that compassion is the ultimate
sustaining and moving power

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, transcending
and overcoming its pain.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
fact that the hand

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is represented as though
viewed simultaneously

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:84%
from back and front would
say that this Bodhisattva

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:90%
power unites opposites.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we are reminded
that compassion in action

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.150 align:middle line:84%
is the key to gaining
entrance to the Path of Souls.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:10%
Now let's talk about the
winged serpent symbolism

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.205 align:middle line:10%
discovered on these artifacts.

00:33:44.205 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:10%
Winged serpents are well known
symbols throughout the world,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.630 align:middle line:10%
especially in ancient Egypt.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:55.120 align:middle line:84%
More, the Hebrew term
for winged serpents

00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.940 align:middle line:84%
is seraph, and is given to
the highest order of angels.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Is this a coincidence or is it
possible that seraphim angels

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.540 align:middle line:90%
manifested in native America?

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:16.159 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Seraphim are
red-winged humanoid beings.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Here is an artifact
depicting a birdman

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:90%
from Spiro Mound in Oklahoma.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:10%
He is representative of
the upper world and part

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:29.210 align:middle line:10%
of a tribe variously described
as ancestral beings, gods

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:32.889 align:middle line:10%
or figures associated
with the divine.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
This Bird Man from
Spiro is often

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:84%
compared to Quetzalcoatl,
the feathered serpent

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:90%
of the Maya tradition.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
At Cahokia Mound near
St. Louis, Missouri,

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:46.659 align:middle line:90%
another birdman was seen.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this description
of an appearance of Jesus

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:55.330 align:middle line:84%
at Cahokia Mound in
1200 A.D., as retold

00:34:55.330 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
by L. Taylor Hanson in her
book, He Walked the Americas.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
"According to Native
American tradition

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Jesus appeared at Cahokia Mound,
and here is the description.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Then a fire lit up
the east sky, where

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
cloud banks had been
piled up and everyone

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:84%
turned in wonder
as consternation

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.040 align:middle line:90%
hushed the chanting.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, he was
there among them.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Like a creature
from another planet,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.300 align:middle line:84%
shining with a strange
radiance, each hair

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.680 align:middle line:84%
on his head luminescent,
a weird glow rippling

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.440 align:middle line:84%
from his garments, and his sea
eyes flashing with lightning.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.280 align:middle line:84%
He stood staring at
the Pawnee people."

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Now with that description
fresh in mind,

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.840 align:middle line:10%
compare that description
with this image

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.790 align:middle line:10%
of Saint Francis of Assisi
receiving the stigmata wounds

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:10%
from Jesus as a
red-winged birdman,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:10%
or seraph, also in
around 1200 A.D. Is

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.210 align:middle line:10%
the timing of the appearance
of the red-winged birdman

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.560 align:middle line:10%
at Cahokia, the
burning man at Cahokia,

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.860 align:middle line:10%
and Jesus as a red-winged
birdman to St. Francis

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.310 align:middle line:10%
of Assisi simply a coincidence?

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible rather that
all these red-winged birdmen

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.420 align:middle line:90%
are from the same tribe?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Are we looking at the
appearance of seraphim angels

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:19.830 align:middle line:90%
in native America?

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And were they sent here to take
us along the Path of Souls?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:84%
As Andrew Collins and
Greg Little point out,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:84%
knowledge of the path
of souls was closely

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.940 align:middle line:84%
guarded by elite
secret societies

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of Shamans and healers
among the Native Americans.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Some claim these elite
beings were descendants

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:84%
of celestial beings,
who originally

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.900 align:middle line:90%
brought this teaching to Earth.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this is
exactly what the evidence is

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:90%
showing in Native America.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And by studying the Native
American Path of Souls story,

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:84%
alongside the ascension
of Francis of Assisi,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and his interaction with
Jesus as a red-wing seraph,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we get a unique
view into the Path

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.540 align:middle line:90%
of Soul's teaching.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Before we go, I would
like to point out

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:84%
one final fact about the
Tennessee Bicentennial Mall,

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
it's not complete.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:10%
Official plans on file
in the Nashville Library

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:10%
call for a river to
be snaking its way

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:10%
up the side of the complex.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.060 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the diagram,
we see that the river is not

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.710 align:middle line:84%
only shaped like the Milky
Way, but it symbolically

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
represents a serpent
winding its way up a pole.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Now what we've got to know here
is that a serpent on a pole

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol from the
Garden of the Hesperides.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, it's
called a Nehushtan.

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:84%
All of this points me to
conclude that the Path of Souls

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is part of a vastly ancient
extraterrestrial ascension

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.720 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.030 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we
will lift this serpent

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and further explore the divine
conduit of these beings.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, be humble,
and let your light shine.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.
