all on a voyage of life,

traveling the cosmos.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:84%
For now, our soul's boat is
sailing the waters of Earth.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And how do we get there?

>>CLARE HENRY:
Next on "Arcanum,"

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.720 align:middle line:84%
we will see how our soul is
indeed an enchanted boat.

>>WILLIAM: I am a soul.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I am a star of gold.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:10%
To the ancient Egyptians,
this poetic line

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:10%
from the pyramid
texts encapsulated

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:10%
who we are as humans.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians
believed our soul

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:10%
was like a wave and
a golden star-being,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:10%
a particle sailing for
eternity upon the barque

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:10%
of the millions of years.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: This ship of eternity
was the sky boat or celestial

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
ship, upon which the
resurrected soul's star of gold

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
traveled the waters of
the universe for eternity.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the boat was a
symbol for eternal life.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: This is why the
boat, ship, or barque occupied

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
a special role in ancient
Egyptian symbolism

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
and other traditions, as well.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Every ancient
Egyptian temple ceremony

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
concluded with a procession
of the gods to which

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
a small statue of the god
was placed inside a boat

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:90%
and carried through the village.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: It may be
argued that the boat is

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
the primordial or universal
symbol of divinity

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and of the soul.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The boat
symbolizes the soul sailing

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:84%
across the sacred river of
life to the golden the realm

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:90%
of paradise.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why the boat is
considered a divine symbol.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: "My soul
is an enchanted boat,"

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%

"which like a sleeping
swan doth float

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: To the
ancient Egyptians,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:90%
the Nile was the river of life.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And look at this incredible
NASA image, the god's eye view,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Nile at night.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
We see it snaking its way
up to the Mediterranean,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
fanning out in the
city of Alexandria,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
right there on the
Mediterranean coast.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely incredible.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
called their fertile land

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Khem, which meant "black land."

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
This word Khem is the
origin of alchemy,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
the art of transformation
or transmutation.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, ancient Egypt was
the original home of Arcanum.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:10%
The earthly Nile was
thought of as a mirror image

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:10%
of the heavenly Nile, the
Milky Way, the Milky Way

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.850 align:middle line:10%
galaxy or the winding waterway,
as the ancient Egyptians

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:10%
referred to it.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:10%
The Nile also symbolized
the afterlife,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient
Egyptians believed

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:10%
that just souls,
or righteous souls,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:10%
came to reside in the
celestial Nile as a star being.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
The entire religion and the
culture of ancient Egypt

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
was all predicated on the
idea that the human body could

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
be transformed into a
star, or a star being.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:10%
If the soul passed all the
tests that it would encounter

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:10%
in what was called to the
Duat or the Netherworld,

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:10%
then it would become one
with Osiris or Sokar,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:10%
lord of this Duat,
and live forever

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:10%
in the night sky
as a bright star.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:10%
This is one of my
favorite images

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:10%
I've ever taken in
Egypt, on my tours

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:10%
there, where we see the
star walker holding,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:10%
in one hand, the
staff of Arcanum

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:10%
and the star in the
other, having become

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:10%
a successful soul, a resurrected
soul, a star being, or a star

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:10%
walker.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:10%
Here's Spell 110 of the
Egyptian Book of the Dead,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:10%
which describes the
afterlife and details

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:10%
the geography of the afterlife.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:10%
We see several tiers here of
the winding waterway, the Milky

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Way, and we see
the soul journeying

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:10%
upon the celestial waters.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:10%
The sky was traversed by water,
and the deceased travelled

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:10%
by boat.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And this is exactly what we
see in the lower register,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:10%
are the sky boats
or the star boats.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
We have a dual-headed
serpent ship rising out

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
of the winding
waterway, the Milky Way,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and we see the
ladder, or stairway,

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:90%
to heaven attached to it.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:90%
This is a cartoon.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And the way I read
this cartoon is

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that this dual-headed serpent
ship is the stairway to heaven.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:10%
As we go on up the
winding waterway,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:10%
we see various tiers with
afterlife activities,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.209 align:middle line:10%
including harvesting and
working with various animals,

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:10%
and this sort of thing because
the ancient Egyptians believed

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:10%
that life was a
continuation of earth life.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:84%
We will do similar
things in the afterlife.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:90%
So we're harvesting here.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
We're working in the field of
the blessed, the field of Aaru,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and harvesting in
the afterlife, just

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:90%
as we did in the Earth life.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we sail upon
the winding waterway, the Milky

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Way, perhaps even
into other galaxies,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:90%
as well, on our enchanted boat.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Another example here
shows the same four tiers.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
We see the same ship rising
out of the Earthly waters--

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
or the winding waterways,
the dual-headed serpent ship

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
with the throne attached,
or the stairway to heaven,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
indicating that this is, in
fact, an ascension vehicle.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We are rising into the Milky
Way and traveling the stars

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:90%
as a celestial being.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
example from a papyrus

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Book of
the Dead, 1350 BC.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:10%
Same concept repeated
over and over again

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:10%
in this Spell 110 that describes
the geography of the afterlife.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:10%
The dual-headed serpent ship
with the stairway to heaven

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:10%
rises out of the waters
of the Milky Way,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:10%
and the soul travels
upon this enchanted boat.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:10%
Another example, this one
in the Metropolitan Museum

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:10%
of Art in New York City.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:10%
The same ideas with
the winding waterway,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:10%
the harvesting, the dual-headed
serpent ship, so forth.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:10%
We're repeating, for emphasis,
so that we get the idea that,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:10%
of the soul as an
enchanted boat,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:10%
and ascending into
the Milky Way.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful color in
these illustrations.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And here we are
harvesting in the field

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of Aaru, the field
of the blessed.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:10%
The blessed are they who have
finished their earthly mission

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:10%
and polished their
soul's diamond, perhaps,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:10%
and now live forever as a star
being in the afterlife with all

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:10%
the other gods who also dwell
in this other dimensional realm.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Here we see Osiris on
his ship of eternity.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Osiris is now the Djed
pillar, or column, perhaps

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:10%
the mast of the
ship, who is cloaked

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:10%
in his bright white garment of
light as an afterlife being.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:10%
In this example, we see a Naos
with the columns and a capital.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:10%
And always, the soul
rising upon its boat out

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:10%
of the winding waterway
and sailing for eternity

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:10%
as a celestial being.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:10%
But in my view, the
most profound examples

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:10%
of the celestial boats
or the star boats

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:10%
are to be found at Hathor's
temple of love and joy

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:10%
at Denderah.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:10%
I've taken many people on tours
to this magnificent temple,

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:10%
and always, we've
entered this temple

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:10%
with great anticipation
of what we're

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:10%
going to see when
we walk inside.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:10%
As we enter this
magnificent temple,

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:10%
we're entering the realm of
Hathor, the goddess of love

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:10%
and joy, who's also
symbolized by the cow.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:10%
The maternal waters of the
Milky Way, the heavens,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:10%
were comparable
to a mother's milk

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient
Egyptian symbolism.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:10%
Thus comes the cow
symbolism for Hathor.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:10%
As a celestial cow,
Hathor is portrayed

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:10%
with stars on her body.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:10%
Holy cow is the
expression, right?

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:10%
Egypt revered mother Hathor
as the holy, heavenly cow

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:10%
whose udder produced
the Milky Way and whose

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.482 align:middle line:10%
body was the stars.

00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at an
image such as this,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:10%
we're actually seeing an
image of the Milky Way.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:10%
Here we see the great royal
wife, Nefertari, with Hathor

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:10%
as a cow on the barque, or
arc of the millions of years

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.860 align:middle line:10%
as it's also called, amidst the
reeds in a magnificent scene

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:10%
from the temple at Abu Simbel.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:10%
So here, in the detail,
we see the lotus ship,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:10%
the dual-headed ship
or dual-gated ship,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:10%
with Hathor, the cow goddess,
amongst the field of the reeds,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:10%
or what is also called the
field of the blessed, the field

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:10%
of the Milky Way galaxy itself.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:10%
I call Denderah,
Stargate Denderah.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:10%
I call all of Egypt
actually, Stargate Egypt,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:10%
because all the temples are,
in fact, portals or gateways,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:10%
entrance ways, portals
into the afterlife.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:10%
Denderah was
actually constructed

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:10%
so that the light of the
helical rising of Sirius

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:10%
would travel down
the main corridor

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:10%
to place its red glow upon
the altar in the inner sanctum

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:10%
of the temple.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:10%
When that light
reached the altar,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:10%
the beam of light from
Sirius was transformed

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:10%
into the star goddess,
Isis, and, in this way,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:10%
the temple steps down the
frequency or the vibration

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
of our companion star, Sirius.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's on the
ceiling where we find

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
the most amazing
aspects of this temple.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:10%
Look at this incredible view
as we look up into the ceiling

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:10%
here, and we see a
group of gods-- 14

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:10%
of them actually --ascending
a gently ascending stairway

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:10%
until they meet the god
of Arcanum, Thoth, who

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:10%
is standing in
front of his mirror.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:10%
Incredible.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:10%
So here are the gods
ascending this stairway

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:10%
until they reach the mirror
of Thoth who is there,

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:10%
guiding them and asking
them, or inviting them,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:10%
into the afterlife realm.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:10%
And here in the detail, we see
Thoth with the eye of Thoth

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:10%
in the mirror, indicating
that this is Arcanum;

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:10%
this is the place we've come
to for advanced instruction.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And here is Thoth,
now, in detail,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
beaming energy to, or
perhaps receiving it from,

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.510 align:middle line:90%
this magnificent eye.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But what we want to see here
is Thoth on his celestial boat.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:84%
We see the pharaoh
standing before Thoth,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
his rod of Arcanum in hand,
and Thoth is offering to him

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:90%
the eye of perfection, the Ujat.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.770 align:middle line:10%
And what this indicates
is that this pharaoh

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:10%
has accomplished the
transformation from a human

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:10%
into a celestial,
or a star being,

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:10%
and is now riding upon
the ship of eternity.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:10%
Thoth also rides upon
the ship of eternity,

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:10%
which is called the arc
of the millions of years,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:10%
or the barque of eternity.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Powerful names, don't you think?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Enchanting names.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:10%
And of course, as I
mentioned, the eye of Thoth

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:10%
is the symbol of Arcanum itself
and the perfection of the soul.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is
that when we take

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
a look at the way
modern science portrays

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
a wormhole, a gateway
into other realms,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it precisely matches the way
the ancient Egyptians portrayed

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:90%
the ship of eternity.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a, some say,
revolutionary interpretation

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that I have applied to the
ancient Egyptian symbolism.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
time I went to Egypt,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.217 align:middle line:84%
and I pointed this
out to the guides

00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:90%
at the temple of Denderah.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:90%
They kind of snickered at me.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what do you
mean, the ship of eternity,

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
the arc of the millions
of years, is a wormhole?

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%
And I showed them.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm happy to report
that when I return to Denderah,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I often will hear the guides,
even from other tour groups,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
saying look at the ceiling,
look at the gods sailing

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:90%
upon their wormhole boats.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's part
of the vernacular.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that this
is exactly what we're

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.050 align:middle line:84%
looking at is these
celestial beings traveling

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
aboard their ships of eternity,
which today we call a wormhole.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:84%
How else does a
celestial, or star being,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
travel the universe, if not
through wormholes or star

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%
gates?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what
we're looking at here

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is the resurrected Osiris as
Orion with his staff of Arcanum

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
in hand, traveling into
the celestial fields

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he's traveling
towards Orion.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And I believe he
is getting there

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
via his star boat, which
is, in fact, a wormhole.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
An incredible revelation
and one of the things

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that I'm most proud
of in my research

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and writing about the ancient
Egyptian mystery religion.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, coming
back to Spell 110,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and what is that
dual-headed serpent ship

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
with the stairway to heaven
attached but also a wormhole.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The symbolism fits,
both in its appearance

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:90%
as well as its meaning.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
They both do the same thing.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
The celestial ship of eternity
is, I believe, a wormhole.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And since 2004,
I've been cataloging

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
images of Osiris and other gods
star walking, as I term it,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or surfing on their
ships of eternity as

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
regenerated or born-again
beings of light.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:90%
They're star beings.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
comparing these images

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to modern depictions of the
star boats scientists call

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
wormholes, or star gates, that
theoretically enable travel

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
through the galaxy, and
even to parallel dimensions,

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
as if there's
nothing in between.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:10%
And as seen here,
the similarities

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:10%
are eye-poppingly perfect.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:10%
And so, over and again,
especially here at Denderah,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:10%
we see the gods, the celestial
beings, on their thrones,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:10%
traveling aboard their star
boats, aboard their wormholes.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:10%
We see the goddesses
upholding the image of heaven.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:10%
The star symbol is
the symbol for heaven

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient Egyptian
symbol tradition.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:10%
And so what we see are
these star boats sailing

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.610 align:middle line:10%
through the stars as celestial
beings are known to do,

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:10%
traveling perhaps
interdimensionally

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:10%
or between star systems, coming
and going from Sirius or Orion,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:10%
the Pleiades, or any of
the other star systems

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:10%
that are so frequently mentioned
in the ancient Egyptian

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.660 align:middle line:10%
tradition, as well as other
Near Eastern traditions.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So over and again, we
see this symbolism.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And now we know what it means.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:10%
It means that these are
celestial beings traveling

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:10%
via wormholes.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
this staff of Arcanum,

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:10%
as I referred to it.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians
called it the Uas scepter,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:10%
and they describe it
producing a flow of sap.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:10%
This life or sap appears to
be a subtle cosmic energy

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:10%
that some believe is
actually drawn from Sirius.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Ptah and
Thoth, once again,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
holding their Arcanum staffs.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that this
is a universal ascension

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.750 align:middle line:10%
staff, as I refer to it?

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:10%
The alchemist
Schwaller de Lubicz

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:10%
described this holy
stick as a living branch,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:10%
conducting the un-manifest
vivifying sap, as he called it,

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:10%
or nourishing sap,
that he believed

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:10%
was drawn from the
star of Sirius.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:10%
This sap-- or is it an oil
because, after all, isn't

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:10%
that the function of
the sap in a tree.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:10%
It is an oil.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:10%
It's a life blood of the tree.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:10%
Schwaller says it's
resonate with the Christian

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Word, the life force energy
upon which the world is built.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:10%
And one could surmise that this
branch, or stick, holy stick,

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:10%
is made from the wood of life.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:10%
Now we have the four elements--
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But in the East, they have the
fifth element, which is wood,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:84%
or the quintessence,
the life force energy.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So it could well be that
this staff is actually

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
a symbol for their mastery of
the fifth essence, the life

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
force energy, the wood
or Word upon which

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:90%
all the universe is built.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
This is an important pun
because, after all, let's

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:84%
think about in the
context of Christianity.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was a carpenter,
meaning he was a wood worker.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean Jesus was
a builder of furniture?

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, could be.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But esoterically,
as a wood worker,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Jesus would be a worker of the
etherical, of the quintessence,

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
of the etheric energy,
the wood or Word

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.650 align:middle line:84%
upon which the
universe is built.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
That's my take on it, anyway.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So continuing on, we
see numerous examples

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.140 align:middle line:84%
of these gods who are sailing
upon their wormhole shaped

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
boats, sitting on
their feathered thrown,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:90%
indicating flight or ascension.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Got their key of life in hand.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Got the Uas sceptor, the
ascension staff, in their hand.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They're good to
go, ready to sail

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
upon the waters
of the Milky Way.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Depictions of these
star boats are

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
found in numerous temples
and tombs of ancient Egypt.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
On my tours, we connect with the
teachings associated with them.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And these teachings are about
becoming regenerated star

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:90%
beings or celestial beings.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
ports of call is Esna.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And when we go into
the temple at Esna,

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:10%
we see, once again,
like at Denderah,

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:10%
the gods upon their
wormhole-shaped boats.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:10%
On the left, we see Ptah,
standing in his shrine

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:10%
aboard his star boat, mounted
to this wormhole-shaped boat

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:10%
of eternity.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And beside him is
Osiris who sails

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.180 align:middle line:10%
upon his ship of eternity.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And in the detail, we see Osiris
laid out on his funeral bier,

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:10%
on his ship of eternity,
sailing upon the stars.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Ptah, or Osiris, is shown
upright here on his boat.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:10%
Now he holds the
combined Ankh, which

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:10%
means life, the
Djed, or stability,

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:10%
and Uas, the key to the
Milky Way, in is hand.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:10%
And this means now he is a
fully-functioning celestial

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:10%
being, able to wield the
energy of the universe

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and travel as a star being.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It suggests to me
that his consciousness

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
is linked with the
universe, and perhaps he

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:84%
travels at the speed of thought
as he surfs upon his star boat.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:10%
This is his companion Sekhmet
who also surfs on her star boat

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:10%
at Esna, also holding her staff.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:10%
Especially captivating
are the two awakened eyes

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:10%
that we see here
and the combination

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.740 align:middle line:10%
of the wormhole symbols.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:10%
I take this is as a sign
that we're waking up

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:10%
to the meaning of the
wormhole-shaped boats

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:10%
of the gods.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.231 align:middle line:10%
Science says that we're a Type
0 civilization on a Kardashev

00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:10%
scale.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
We cannibalize the biological
resources of our planet.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to become a Type
1 civilization that will then

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
harness the power of our
local star-- or, excuse me,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
harness the power of our planet
as our primary energy resource.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We'll stop using
biological fuel and use

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
the power, or the energy,
of the planet itself.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
When we become a
Type 2 civilization,

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
we'll harness the power of
our local star, our sun,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and that will become our
primary energy source.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Type 3 beings actually harness
the power of the black hole

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
at the center of a
galaxy, and they're

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
a space-faring civilization
in that they're

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
able to colonize not
only their local star

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
system, but, in
fact, the galaxy.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe that these
beings that we're

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
seeing on the star boats in
Egypt, these celestial beings,

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
are Type 3 beings on
the Kardashev scale.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They're non-physical beings
that inhabit the entire galaxy

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and have the ability to travel
the stars through star boats

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%
or wormholes.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
The Book of the
Amduat, or what is

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
called the Book of What
is in the Netherworld,

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:84%
records Ra's night sea
journey on his arc of eternity

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.010 align:middle line:84%
as he crosses the
underworld in his boat.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's shaped
like a wormhole.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:10%
He has the key of
life on his knee,

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:10%
and he prepares to sail
into this gate of stars

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:10%
that I prefer to
call a stargate.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:10%
It appears to me
that this cartoon

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:10%
is describing Ra's journey
into another dimension,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps into
other star systems.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:10%
After successfully crossing the
underworld on his night barque,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:10%
Ra then emerges in
his morning barque.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:10%
Now, what some
people would say is

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:10%
that this is simply an
image of the sun that

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:10%
is crossing into
the star of field.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd be
comfortable with that

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
because, to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:84%
our sun was, in fact,
a sun tunnel, a star

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:90%
tunnel, or a stargate.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
As Christianity teaches, the way
to heaven is through the sun.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They spell it S-O-N.
But in ancient Egypt,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:84%
we would spell it, in English,
S-U-N. And the pun fits.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The way to heaven, the way to
the star field of the Milky

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Way, is through the sun.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And actually, modern
Russian scientists

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:84%
are now hypothesizing
that our sun produces

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:84%
an oil, a sap, a fluid,
a liquid at its center

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that could potentially open
a wormhole into other star

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So it seems we're waking up.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Modern science is
beginning to think

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:90%
like the ancient Egyptians.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible revelation.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And what a time we're
in for as this unfolds,

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as we awaken to think
about the possibility

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that we might be this close
to learning to dematerialize

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
our bodies into light and
board the wormholes of eternity

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and sail for eternity
as star beings.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine that.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Believe it, and we will live it.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
The shape, again, of Ra's ship
matches a modern wormhole.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
a coincidence.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I think these gods
actually sailed the stars,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
as eternal light
beings, on wormholes.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
An incredible correspondence.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:10%
And again, something I'm
very proud of to have

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.049 align:middle line:10%
made, been the originator
of this correspondence.

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a look at this here.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:10%
This is a NASA
image, or depiction,

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:10%
of a hypothetical wormhole
induction-propelled spacecraft.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:10%
NASA envisions,
within 100 years,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:10%
according to their
100-year starship program,

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:10%
being able to create a warp
craft similar to that what

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:10%
we see on Star Trek and being
able to open through warp

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:10%
craft, or warp drives,
wormholes that lead

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:10%
to other star systems.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Presently, to travel to our
nearest star, Alpha Centauri,

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
it would take 75,000 years in
a conventional rocket ship.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We can make that journey in
two weeks in a warp craft.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And NASA has set its sights
on accomplishing this

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
within 100 years.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:10%
What I would
suggest is that they

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:40.910 align:middle line:10%
want to go back and start
getting some inspiration

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient Egyptians and
other cultures that describe

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:10%
traveling the stars
in star boats.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:10%
Because what they're
going to find

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:10%
is that this body
isn't going anywhere.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a boundary
that flesh and blood cannot

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
inherit the kingdom of heaven.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a boundary that keeps
us locked on the earth plane.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
The only way that we
can travel the stars

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.740 align:middle line:84%
is to transform ourselves
into celestial beings.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
the NASA scientists want

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to start thinking
in those terms.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
only way we're going

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to travel
between star systems

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
is as celestial beings, star
beings, or light beings.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:84%
The wormhole, to me, I think
is the primordial shape,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:90%
the ultimate symbol.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, which came first,
the earthly conception

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of a boat being shaped
like a wormhole,

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.650 align:middle line:84%
or did the Egyptian artists
pull it out of the stars?

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:42.560 align:middle line:10%
I believe that this is
the primordial symbol

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:10%
because it symbolizes all
of our journey as a soul.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:90%
We all experience a birth.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We live a life.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And then we experience a death.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we enter a
portal, a womb, a wormhole.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:10%
We emerge into the
three-dimensional world,

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:10%
the manifest world,
through a portal,

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:10%
our mother's womb
and the birth canal.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Then we experience life.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, at death,
we experience,

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
according to near-death
experiencers, the opening

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
of another portal, or
gateway, into another realm.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:10%
So we all began life
with an inhuman past.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.440 align:middle line:10%
We came from somewhere else.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:10%
We're temporarily
inhabiting the earth plane.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:10%
We experience a life, which
is, we think of as the present.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And life is a gift,
after all, isn't it?

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Then at some point
in the future,

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
we will experience
a resurrection.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise of
numerous spiritual traditions.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I call earth
Stargate U, because we're here

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:10%
to learn to transform ourselves
into celestial or star beings,

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:10%
to perfect ourselves, to
become more whole, more

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:10%
holy and complete,
so that then we

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:10%
can open the gate
of resurrection

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.120 align:middle line:10%
just like the ancient Egyptians.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this
example in more detail

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:90%
here because this is the sun.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:90%
This is Ra.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:90%
He's on his ship.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But look at the ladder
in the front here.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.830 align:middle line:10%
This indicates that
this ship is, in fact,

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:10%
the ladder, or
stairway, to heaven.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:10%
We find this motif,
this symbolism,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:10%
expressed even in
Egyptian jewelry.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:10%
It's not just on temple
walls or on papyruses.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.900 align:middle line:10%
It's in jewelry, such as
this example here where

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:10%
this lucky pharaoh is
aboard his ship of eternity,

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:10%
protected by Isis and Nephthys.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:10%
The symbol of heaven is up
above, filled with stars.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:10%
He's sailing on
the cosmic waters.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.680 align:middle line:10%
This is the hope and promise
of the Egyptian religion.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And actually, this
piece of jewelry

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:10%
would've been worn on the
heart of this pharaoh,

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:10%
perhaps as a
reminder of our quest

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:10%
on Earth: to learn to master
this stargate metaphysics,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:10%
as I call it, and board
the ship of eternity.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, this 4,500 year
old solar boat of the pharaoh

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:06.550 align:middle line:10%
was discovered in 1954,
buried in a sealed pit

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:10%
at the foot of the
great pyramids of Giza.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:10%
You can visit it today.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:10%
It's extraordinary, and it's
in incredible, pristine shape,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.660 align:middle line:10%
even after all this time.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:10%
And what we notice is that
this ship is precisely

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:10%
shaped like a wormhole.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Khufu ship,
after it's presumed owner,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:10%
the second pharaoh
of the fourth dynasty

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.300 align:middle line:10%
who is presumed to have
built the Great Pyramid.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:10%
It's part of his kit of tools
intended for the afterlife.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And again, could it be
that the ancient Egyptians

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:10%
knew about wormholes?

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they did.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And this synchronicity
presents a question.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, which came
first; the shape

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of the celestial
ship, the wormhole,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:90%
or the man-made earthly ship?

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that the ancient
Egyptians created earthly ships

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of wormholes
because they downloaded

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that primordial ship--
or shape, rather.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The Vikings also created
wormhole-shaped ships.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:90%
They burned soul boats at sea.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Norway is renowned for
its Viking heritage,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:84%
as seen here, located in the
Kulturhistorisk Museum in Oslo.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
The shape of this ship, which
is intended to be burnt at sea,

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
is identical to that of the
soul, or solar, boat-- another

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:90%
pun-- we find in ancient Egypt.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The boat of the
millions of years

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is here seen on the tomb of Seti
I in the Valley of the Kings

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And a serpent now
rides upon the ship.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very
interesting bit of symbolism

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because the serpent
symbolizes immortality,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:90%
the shedding of the skin.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.130 align:middle line:90%
It also symbolizes a vibration.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Think of a serpent or sine wave.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So once again, we are
triggered to think

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.620 align:middle line:84%
about the concept of
sound or vibration,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps the
ancient Egyptians

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
were masters of
sound or vibration.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And here we see the god Khnum
with his staff of Arcanum

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:84%
with the serpent being
lifted beside it.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what Moses did when

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:84%
he lifted the serpent of
healing in the wilderness.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Is he lifting a vibration
from within himself

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that produces a healing
sound or vibration

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
as happened in the story?

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, from the tomb of Seti,
we see this exact symbolism,

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
once again, with the serpent
or vibration, the sine wave,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:84%
encapsulating Khnum on
the wormhole-shaped boat.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a very popular
motif in Egypt.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:10%
But switching over
to ancient Samaria

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:10%
and Babylon, what do we
find but the sun god,

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:10%
Shamash, on his throne,
riding upon his serpent ship.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.750 align:middle line:10%
And look at the demarcations
on this serpent ship,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:10%
which, by the way, has
the torso of a human

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:10%
and the head of a human.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:10%
We see these notches on
the serpent ship here.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:10%
And to me, that
indicates spiraling.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Again, connecting us to
the idea of vibration

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.860 align:middle line:84%
but also the opening of
a portal, or a vortex,

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.810 align:middle line:84%
as the sun god spirals
his way through the cosmos

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:90%
on his serpent ship.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
He's actually riding a
vibrational wave, in my view.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The correspondence
between ancient Samaria

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.170 align:middle line:84%
with Shamash and Ra aboard
his ship, it's identical.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a transposition

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:84%
of this symbolism-- or a
transmission of this symbolism

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
from one culture to the next
with identical meanings.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Enki, the great creator god
of the Anunnaki tradition

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Samaria,
travels in the boat

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to the afterworld, or the
afterlife, or the underworld.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:10%
Here's the king with his
winged sun disk above.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's another
form of craft.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's also, of
course, a ship.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And the pun on craft and
ship is a very important one

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because the alchemists
were all about the craft.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.300 align:middle line:90%
They called their art the craft.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
hoping to do was

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to craft a perfect, or light,
body that then would become

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
the ship upon which
they sail for eternity.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So here we see the Anunnaki
gods, or priests, rather,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:84%
on either side of the radiant
tree of life with the sun god

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Shamash above in his winged,
or radiant, craft, even

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:84%
beaming energy to this
radiant tree of life.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.090 align:middle line:10%
Same thing is
going on here where

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:52.960 align:middle line:10%
we see the priest
kings, now called

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.310 align:middle line:10%
the Apkallu, who wear
their fish cloaks,

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.140 align:middle line:10%
standing on the side of
the radiant tree of life

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:10%
with the gods above in
their craft, presumed

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:10%
to be sailing for eternity
as celestial beings.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:10.030 align:middle line:10%
Here again, the god in the
winged sun disk, or craft,

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:10%
is hovering above the
radiant tree of life

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:10%
while the Apkallu priests
stand on either side.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.690 align:middle line:10%
This is a purification ceremony
that we're witnessing here.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The officiating fish priest is
the maasmasu, or the purifier.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are, in fact,
being purified, I propose,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:34.100 align:middle line:84%
in preparation for sailing
upon the ship of eternity,

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:84%
or the arc of the
millions of years,

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient Egyptians
referred to it.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Powerful, powerful
correspondance

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:90%
here with alchemy.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the
craft, Arcanum-- it's

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
all about purification
and manifestation

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of the light body.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Here is Enki, who is the
Samarian god of smithcraft

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy, the god of the
craft, the god of wisdom

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.080 align:middle line:84%
who took humanity on a
guided tour of the afterlife

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:90%
aboard his boat.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Now some will argue
that this winged craft

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.715 align:middle line:84%
is like a UFO, a
metallic flying saucer.

00:34:09.715 --> 00:34:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we're talking
about something far more

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:90%
profound than that.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This is an organic
light vehicle that

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:84%
takes the soul
into the afterlife.

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It is the boat of eternity, the
ship of the millions of years,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.929 align:middle line:84%
the arc of the
millions of years,

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient Egyptians
referred to it.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:10%
This journey is always about
crossing over, or between,

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.139 align:middle line:10%
unknown realms.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:10%
And while many associate
the soul boat with death,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:10%
it is equally a symbol of birth.

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Very powerful difference.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's also a
symbol of incarnation

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:10%
because they believe that our
soul is an enchanted boat that

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:10%
continually incarnates,
whether on the earth plane

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:10%
or in other star systems or in
planets within the Milky Way

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:10%
or even extending it
out into the hundreds

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:10%
of billions of galaxies that
NASA and other scientists

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:10%
now tell us inhabits
the known universe.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Layer on top of that the
concept that we, in fact,

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:84%
live in a multiverse, and you
see how now our enchanted boat

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:84%
actually sails
for eternity into,

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:84%
not only other star
systems and other galaxies,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:90%
but other universes.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It just goes on and on and on.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the journey.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Painters and visionaries
with opened mind's eyes

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
have glimpsed the
boat of eternity

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
ever since the
ancient Egyptians.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.270 align:middle line:84%
A favorite modern
artist is Walter Crane

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
who shows this magnificent
image that's titled "My Soul

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Is An Enchanted Boat."

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.770 align:middle line:10%
It may be observed that the
most successful of these artists

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:56.476 align:middle line:10%
are they who also see the
ferryman stealing, or, excuse

00:35:56.476 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:10%
me, steering the soul, or
boat, along the River Styx

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.890 align:middle line:10%
to the land of the living.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:10%
So here's Walter
Crane's "My Soul

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:10%
Is An Enchanted Boat"
that's being guided along,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:11.820 align:middle line:10%
sailing upon the ship of
eternity by this winged being,

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.550 align:middle line:10%
the fairy being who
is guiding the ship.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:10%
This is our higher self,
our messenger self,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.120 align:middle line:10%
our guardian angel that
is steering the ship.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.490 align:middle line:10%
It's our mystic guide on
our path through the stars

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.120 align:middle line:10%
and, indeed, the galaxies
and even the universes.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:10%
Ever present, but too often
unseen, as Clare will show,

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:10%
the ferryman is always there.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:10%
The messenger is always there
to help us to guide our soul

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:10%
ship along our earthly
journey so that we can, once

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:10%
again, return to the
stars as celestial beings.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:10%
Christianity claims
that the boat, or ship,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.377 align:middle line:10%
is a symbol for the
Immaculate Conception--

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:10%
hmm --and the
Virgin Mary's womb,

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:10%
the vessel that brought
Jesus to the human world,

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:10%
to the earth plane.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:10%
And, again, in the
gnostic view, Jesus

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:10%
is a celestial,
or star, being who

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:10%
manifested on the earth plane.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And he did so by coming
through the womb,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:90%
or gate, of the Virgin Mary.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:10%
The archetypal almond
shape of the hull of a ship

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:10%
is compared to the
vulva or birth canal.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.790 align:middle line:10%
So maybe this is the origin
of the ship symbolism.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from the cosmos.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it comes
from the human body

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
where the ship is now
the vulva or birth canal.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So here's the hull of a ship.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And just for
illustration purposes,

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I brought a second one in here
and flipped it upside down.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's our almond
shape, the shape

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of the ship of eternity,
the gateway, the man-dorla,

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.900 align:middle line:84%
the almond-shaped gate of
eternity, so often used,

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
especially in
Christian symbolism.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, we look need no
further than this example here

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.050 align:middle line:84%
of Mary beaming us
energy in her ship,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:90%
her almond-shaped gateway.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.540 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians called
this almond-shape Ru,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:84%
which they interpreted as the
gate to the field of eternity.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so here we can imagine
Mary is in the gate of life.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:84%
She's in a boat symbol, or the
portal in between realities.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And here, we notice
the rainbow motif.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting on
the arcing rainbow,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and she's also encapsulated
within, or riding within,

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the ship of eternity, the
almond-shaped gateway,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:90%
also portrayed as a rainbow.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.270 align:middle line:84%
We see this in
numerous instances

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.130 align:middle line:84%
in Christian art
portraying the incarnation

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:90%
of the celestial being, Jesus.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:10%
As for example here,
Jacopa di Cione

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:10%
in the "Madonna and
the Child in Glory".

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:10%
We see Mary as the virgin
with her star cloak on.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:10%
We see Jesus on her lap.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:10%
And they're both inside
this ship, or gateway,

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:10%
this radiant ship, or portal,
through which they manifest.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.395 align:middle line:10%
Here's the "Altar from La
Mare de Deu in El Coll,"

00:39:11.395 --> 00:39:13.070 align:middle line:10%
from the 12th century.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.080 align:middle line:10%
Mary-- and Jesus
on her lap-- she's

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:10%
in the almond-shaped
gateway filled with stars.

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:10%
And now, as we go into the
detail here of this incredibly

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:10%
beautiful painting, we see
Mary's star cloak is, in fact,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:31.530 align:middle line:10%
covered with the Chintamani
symbol, the symbol

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:10%
of the wish-fulfilling
jewel, the jewel of Arcanum.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And this further
solidifies the idea

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:43.940 align:middle line:10%
that she is a master of the
craft, the master of Arcanum,

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:10%
of manifesting the light
body and the ability

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:10%
to toggle, or phase, back and
forth between the material

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:10%
and the immaterial realm.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.420 align:middle line:10%
She is Isis.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the
ancient Egyptians

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
referred to the arc of
the millions of years,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:84%
or the ship of eternity,
as the light ship of Isis.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:07.570 align:middle line:10%
Well, here, it's Mary who
now takes the place of Isis.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:11.680 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus is taking the
place of Horace, the sun god.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:10%
And she is enfolded within
this radiant gateway of light.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:10%
She's in the portal,
the ship of eternity.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:10%
Here's the "Altarpiece of the
Virgin of Guadalupe," where

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:10%
Mary, again, is
wearing the star cloak.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:10%
She also wears her crown.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.000 align:middle line:10%
And she is in the almond-shaped
gateway, the portal or symbol

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:10%
of the ship of eternity.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:10%
In the detail here, we see
her in this prayer pose,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:10%
meditating, radiating light.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.700 align:middle line:10%
And once again, we're encouraged
to connect with this imagery,

00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:10%
to feel this radiant light,
this holy light emanating

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.790 align:middle line:10%
from Mary's body.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.491 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorites is
"The Virgin and Child".

00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:10%
It's just stunning
in its beauty.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:02.130 align:middle line:10%
You can spend hours getting lost
in this painting, and I have.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.520 align:middle line:10%
And what we see, once again,
is Mary with the baby Jesus.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:10%
She's in the egg-shaped
gateway, the portal, the ship,

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:10%
the gateway between
the dimensions.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:10%
This small painting
of the Madonna

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:10%
depicts a fragile female figure
holding her newborn together.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:10%
The artist indicates
her floating

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:10%
in concentric rainbow rings that
are also populated by angels.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.320 align:middle line:10%
This, to me, is saying
that the artist is showing

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:10%
this as a portal or gateway
into other dimensions that

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.580 align:middle line:10%
are inhabited by other
dimensional beings,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.450 align:middle line:10%
perhaps celestial beings
like the ancient Egyptians

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.330 align:middle line:10%
were showing.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:10%
She's standing on the
vanquished dragon, which

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:47.130 align:middle line:10%
indicates she has
conquered fear.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:10%
She has conquered
the dragon that

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:53.890 align:middle line:10%
guards the pearl, that guards
the abilities of the soul.

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:10%
The infant Jesus is playing
two bells in concert

00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.860 align:middle line:10%
with the angel on the left--
the left side of the painting,

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:10%
indicating sound, music,
vibration, once again,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:10%
is the key to opening
the portal, or gateway,

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:10%
into other dimensions.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I've said so many
times that sometimes we

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:84%
spend our lives tuned in to just
one narrow band of frequency.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.990 align:middle line:10%
And on either side of that
narrow band are wide open

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.580 align:middle line:10%
worlds where we can communicate
with other dimensional beings,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:10%
angelic beings that
are here to assist us.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.400 align:middle line:10%
It appears to me that Jesus is
in the role of the conductor

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:10%
here because, clearly, the baby
Jesus and the angel over here

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:10%
are definitely looking
at one another.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:10%
They're jammin', right?

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And Jesus is the conductor
of this musical ceremony

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:10%
that we're
participating in here.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:10%
They're making music together.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:10%
They're crossing over
dimensions by swapping tunes.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They're in the shed,
right, chopping wood.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That's what they say in
Nashville where I live.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You play guitar, you've
got an ax, right?

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
going to go practice,

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:90%
you're going to go chop wood.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that you're
going to go into a wood shed

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and literally chop
wood; it means

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.869 align:middle line:84%
you're going to play
tones and vibrations.

00:43:08.869 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:84%
You're going to open
gateways to other realms.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.920 align:middle line:90%
You're going to play tunes, man.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's
happening here is

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.390 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus is the
cosmic musician,

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:10%
playing the music
of the spheres,

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:10%
and the angels are
there to jam with him.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And as a consequence, they're
opening the portal, or gateway,

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.830 align:middle line:10%
the ship of eternity, and
are opening each other

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:10%
to other dimensional
experiences.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:10%
It shows, again,
the conductor Jesus

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:10%
in the role of the
universal prime mover.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember when we looked at the
Philosophers' Stone episode

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.390 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus has the
wand in his hand.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.530 align:middle line:84%
What if that is,
in fact, is a baton

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and he's like a
symphony conductor,

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:55.910 align:middle line:84%
just playing away the universal
tunes, the cosmic tones that

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.475 align:middle line:90%
animate the entire universe.

00:43:57.475 --> 00:44:01.280 align:middle line:10%
And he's able to call a
tune and make anything

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:10%
manifest as a
consequence, including

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.510 align:middle line:10%
opening the gateway
to other dimensions

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:10%
as is happening here.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a seraphim over
on the right, the highest

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:84%
order of angels, indicating
that this portal, or gateway,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:84%
extends out even
into the farthest

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
reaches of the universe where
the beings of light and love

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:21.780 align:middle line:90%
dwell.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
You can see why this is one
of my favorite paintings.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.000 align:middle line:90%
There is so much going on here.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.640 align:middle line:84%
We could practically spend an
entire episode of "Arcanum"

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:90%
just on this one painting.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely extraordinary.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Christianity adopted the
boat as a secret symbol.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
The ship of souls
was, of course,

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:90%
known as the Bark of St. Peter.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And they took this
symbolism and flipped it

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:90%
in an extraordinary way.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:52.590 align:middle line:84%
The use of the boat metaphor
was made physical in the nave,

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Latin for ship, of European
Christian churches which

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:84%
actually took the shape
of an upturned boat hull,

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.380 align:middle line:84%
referring to the
spiritual journey.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.060 align:middle line:84%
How many people
realize that when

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.320 align:middle line:84%
they enter a Christian
church, they're

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.490 align:middle line:84%
actually entering
the hull of a ship?

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's meant to be a portal,
or a vehicle, for our journey

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.220 align:middle line:10%
into other realms, into
other higher dimensions.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.630 align:middle line:10%
The boat represents the church.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:84%
As St. Augustine explained in
his exegesis of Noah's ark,

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the image of the church as a
boat in which the faithful find

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:30.850 align:middle line:84%
refuge from the
sea of the world is

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.760 align:middle line:84%
extremely commonplace
in medieval iconography.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The architecture of the
church building itself

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is meant to recall
an image of a boat.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The nave, again from the
Latin novice meaning ship,

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.380 align:middle line:84%
is often constructed so that
the roof resembles an upside

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:90%
down ship's keel.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.020 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the most
powerful example of this

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is the Arena Chapel in Italy
painted by the master Giotto

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
where we see the upturned
boat in all the signs

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and symbols of the
Christian teaching,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:84%
especially the last judgment
present in this upturned boat.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:10%
If we can absorb and understand
all this mystical symbolism,

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced, we
will be able to enter

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.910 align:middle line:10%
into the cosmic realm inhabited
by these celestial, transformed

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.850 align:middle line:10%
beings.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, on the hull of this
ship, this upturned boat,

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.010 align:middle line:84%
we see stars indicating that
this is a portal, or gateway,

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.480 align:middle line:84%
into the star field,
the field of the blessed

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:90%
as the Egyptians called it.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And who do we see in this star
field greeting us but Jesus,

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:40.160 align:middle line:84%
holding the book of Arcanum
on his lap, enfolded

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.360 align:middle line:84%
within the rainbow ring,
and encouraging us,

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
in fact inviting us, to make
the journey, to board the ship,

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:53.230 align:middle line:90%
to set our sails for eternity.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:57.414 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
secret of Arcanum.

00:46:57.414 --> 00:47:03.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, Clare is
going to share with us

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
the magic of Thomas Cole who
did an amazing job visualizing

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:90%
our soul as an enchanted boat.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: On this segment
of "Beyond on the Veil,"

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to share one of my
favorite painters, Thomas Cole,

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.620 align:middle line:84%
in his fantastic
selection of four

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:28.100 align:middle line:84%
paintings about "my soul
is an enchanted boat".

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:39.650 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Cole was viewed as one of
the most accomplished landscape

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:90%
painters in the world.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.380 align:middle line:10%
Originally from
England, he eventually

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:10%
moved to Philadelphia in 1824.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Cole spent many years
abroad in England, Italy,

00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:01.730 align:middle line:10%
and Europe in an effort to study
the style of the old masters,

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.510 align:middle line:10%
and he was the founder
of the Hudson River

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:10%
School in New York state.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.210 align:middle line:10%
Cole, although primarily
a painter of landscapes,

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.890 align:middle line:10%
also painted mystical
and visionary works,

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:18.410 align:middle line:10%
including "Expulsion
from the Garden of Eden"

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:23.170 align:middle line:10%
showing the gate, or portal,
to Eden as a blinding light.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the gate we seek
to reopen with Arcanum.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:34.050 align:middle line:10%
Cole's "The Pilgrim of the
Cross at the End of his Journey"

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:38.460 align:middle line:10%
shows the portal, or
crossing place, in the sky.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.015 align:middle line:84%
Recognizing we are
all pilgrims, Cole

00:48:42.015 --> 00:48:45.570 align:middle line:84%
invites us to take the next
step and to scale the ladder

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:48.220 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.730 align:middle line:10%
"The Titan's Goblet"--
one of my favorites, too--

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.360 align:middle line:10%
is a simply stunning example
of Cole's ability to portray

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:00.700 align:middle line:10%
heaven and earth in
the world of matter.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.110 align:middle line:10%
"The Voyage of Life"
series is a more

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:10%
personal Christian
allegory that interprets,

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:10%
visually, the journey of man
through four stages of life:

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:18.520 align:middle line:10%
childhood, youth,
manhood, and old age.

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.271 align:middle line:10%
The series of four paintings
was completed in 1840

00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:25.600 align:middle line:10%
to great success
after being exhibited

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.830 align:middle line:10%
in the National
Gallery in New York.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:10%
Whilst in Rome, Cole painted the
second set of the same series.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:84%
These four
extraordinary paintings

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.430 align:middle line:84%
take the viewer along a
delicious path from birth

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.780 align:middle line:84%
to death and beyond,
incorporating the elements

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
of life symbolized
by the flowing river.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.800 align:middle line:84%
His ethereal depiction of
mountains, landscape, sky,

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:84%
the boat, the angel, the
flowers, and time masterly

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.620 align:middle line:90%
disguised in the hourglass.

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.960 align:middle line:84%
The first painting
out of the four

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that Thomas Cole painted
in "The Voyage of Life"

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.130 align:middle line:90%
series is called "Childhood".

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Like many of the
great masters who

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.270 align:middle line:84%
created paintings of
an ethereal nature,

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Cole was highly religious
and admitted to the fact

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that he had visions of angels,
and such like, in written

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:28.590 align:middle line:84%
letters published by
Barnes and Noble in 1840.

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Cole must've
known that the angel who

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:35.330 align:middle line:84%
guides the baby's soul in
all these four paintings,

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, our higher self.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Winged and radiant, the
angel gently guides the boat.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.540 align:middle line:84%
At the foot of the
mountain, the cave

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.210 align:middle line:84%
represents mother's
womb, the birthplace,

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:56.600 align:middle line:84%
emblematic of our earthly
origin and the mysterious past.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.280 align:middle line:84%
A stream is seen issuing
from the deep cavern

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.050 align:middle line:84%
in the side of the craggy
and precipitous mountain.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The mountain peaks reach
high above the clouds,

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:10.570 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the baby's soul
is still partially linked

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to the heavenly realms and,
of course, invisible to man.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.790 align:middle line:84%
If one looks
carefully, faces can

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:84%
be seen within the
mountain, suggesting

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.770 align:middle line:84%
there are powerful
unknown forces hidden

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:27.540 align:middle line:90%
in the very fabric of the earth.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Could they be connected
to us, in some way?

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
mountains guard and assist us

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:38.220 align:middle line:90%
in our voyage of life?

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Cole's use of color is ethereal.

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
rising sun gently

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.650 align:middle line:84%
reflects on the
distant mountains,

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:51.360 align:middle line:84%
giving a feeling of comfort
for the newborn child.

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:54.100 align:middle line:84%
From out of the dark
cave glides a boat,

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:84%
representing the arrival of our
soul in the world of matter,

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.190 align:middle line:84%
sailing calmly on
the cosmic waters

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%
of our earthly existence.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The passage is narrow,
which symbolizes

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.485 align:middle line:84%
the sheltered experience
of the newborn traveler.

00:52:07.485 --> 00:52:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.280 align:middle line:84%
The baby stretches his
arms in sheer abandonment,

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.910 align:middle line:84%
trust, innocence, and joy,
void of earthly trappings.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:84%
On the riverbank, a paradise
of flowers in spring

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.450 align:middle line:84%
bloom, with the sun
rising in the east,

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:31.200 align:middle line:84%
symbolizing the golden
early morning of the day.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The boat seems to
emerge from Eden--

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:84%
at least this flowery scene
is reminiscent of Cole's

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:90%
"Flowers of Eden."

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The boat, whose
golden prow and sides

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:84%
are sculptured into
figures of the hours

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.300 align:middle line:84%
linking mortality with
time and the soul's descent

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:84%
into matter downstream, is
steered by an angelic form

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and laden with beautiful
new buds and flowers.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:06.830 align:middle line:84%
This innocent baby's soul is
deeply loved and protected

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:10.460 align:middle line:84%
by all that surrounds
him, yet oblivious of what

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:15.280 align:middle line:84%
is ahead of him on the
start of his journey.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.070 align:middle line:84%
The guardian angel
acts like a rudder

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.080 align:middle line:84%
and stands with
outstretched arms

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.410 align:middle line:84%
behind the baby's
soul in the boat,

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:27.010 align:middle line:84%
guiding him safely
along the way.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.370 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian lotus in the
foreground of the painting

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:84%
represents eternity and suggests
that the voyager of the soul

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.980 align:middle line:84%
never ends, whether on
earth or other dimensions.

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The second painting of the
series is called "Youth".

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the baby has
grown into a youth yearning

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to be older than his tender
years and feeding his ego

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and dreaming of adventure.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Alone in the boat, his destiny
in his own hands, with his hand

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:84%
firmly on the rudder,
embracing free will.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.810 align:middle line:84%
He enthusiastically acknowledges
the heavenly realms,

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:15.760 align:middle line:84%
with his eyes focused on the
castles in the sky which are,

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.170 align:middle line:90%
of course, his dreams.

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Along the river, he journeys
amidst luscious plantation--

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:84%
lofty trees, all in full bloom,
and a rosy light overhead,

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.090 align:middle line:84%
depicting a summer
scene at midday.

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The angel stands on the flowery
banks and waves the youth

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:41.080 align:middle line:84%
safe passage, willing him to
learn the lessons he came back

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to Earth to learn
in this lifetime,

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:48.550 align:middle line:84%
but always watching
and protecting him.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:84%
The youth is healthy, powerful,
and hungry for adventure,

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.950 align:middle line:84%
oblivious of the
beauty around him.

00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The dimly lit path
intimates that youth,

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in its impetuous
career, is forgetful

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that it has embarked
on the stream of life.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:84%
The river of wider
scope winds endlessly,

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.380 align:middle line:84%
depicting the path of life
glimpsed between the trees

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.550 align:middle line:84%
as it ebbs and flows
into the distance.

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The river current sweeps
along with restless force

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and increases in
swiftness as it descends

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:28.580 align:middle line:84%
toward the great
ocean of eternity.

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:84%
In the far distance, the
river takes a sharp turn

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.940 align:middle line:84%
in the far right
of the painting.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.760 align:middle line:90%
The river starts to speed up.

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:84%
There are craggy rocks and
cliffs and menacing waters

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.030 align:middle line:84%
from rapid currents,
suggesting the youth has

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
some lasting lessons
to learn in the future.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:52.350 align:middle line:84%
High up in the sky is
the cloud-built castle,

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.200 align:middle line:84%
with its many mansions,
depicting the youth's dreams

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and aspirations
guarded by angels.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:84%
The city of dreams,
separating heaven and earth,

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.503 align:middle line:84%
clearly veiled in the painting
to symbolize forgetfulness.

00:56:05.503 --> 00:56:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The hours carved on
the front of the boat

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.500 align:middle line:84%
are shining and new, giving
safe passage to the youth

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and instilling powers to teach
the youngster the tools he

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.710 align:middle line:84%
needs to survive in
the world of matter

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:25.330 align:middle line:90%
if he so chooses to do so.

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:29.380 align:middle line:84%
The hourglass is no longer full,
suggesting his time on earth

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.230 align:middle line:90%
has already been decided.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:35.995 align:middle line:84%
Cole leads us forward
to the third painting

00:56:35.995 --> 00:56:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of the series, called "Manhood".

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The youth has become
a man and now faces

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.880 align:middle line:90%
the hard trials of life.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Nature's fury, evil
demons, and self-doubt

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:52.070 align:middle line:84%
threaten the voyager who
struggles with his sorrowing

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:56.060 align:middle line:90%
soul between doubt and faith.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And only divine
intervention, Cole suggested,

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:04.170 align:middle line:84%
can save the voyager
from a tragic fate.

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The storms of Maya begin
to strip his ego, which,

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in turn, helps to remind
him of his divine roots.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Full of fear, he is
unaware of the light

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in the distance, the
divine support that

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:23.600 align:middle line:84%
has been with him since he was
born into the world of matter.

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.900 align:middle line:84%
The warm sunlight of youth
has been clouded over

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:32.430 align:middle line:84%
with dark, menacing, stormy
skies and torrential rains.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The fresh green grass
is gone, replaced

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.570 align:middle line:90%
by hard and unforgiving rock.

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And the trees have become
wind-beaten, broken, gnarled,

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.420 align:middle line:90%
and leafless.

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The swollen river
rushes furiously

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.390 align:middle line:84%
toward the ocean, which is
dimly seen in the distance

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.900 align:middle line:84%
through the mist, down
a dark ravine, whirling

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.960 align:middle line:90%
and foaming in its wild wake.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The river represents the
flow of life, with its twists

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:06.000 align:middle line:90%
and turns symbolizing choices.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Unknown to the voyager, the
angel is but a glance away,

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.860 align:middle line:84%
amidst the clouds,
watching and waiting

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:17.260 align:middle line:84%
for her ward to
complete his test.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.280 align:middle line:84%
The hourglass
continues to lose sand,

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and the voyager is
running out of time.

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.680 align:middle line:84%
The boat, empty of the
flowers that once adorned it,

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:29.310 align:middle line:84%
is damaged, and
the tiller is gone.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The voyager no longer
has control of his boat.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.350 align:middle line:84%
The extreme narrowness of the
passage between the two rock

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.720 align:middle line:84%
faces heightens the
tension of the voyager

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.800 align:middle line:84%
as evil spirits stare down
for the dark clouds above.

00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:48.910 align:middle line:84%
The man grows ever more fearful
as the river turns violent

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and threatens to upturn
the voyager's boat,

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:56.530 align:middle line:84%
implying the precarious
nature of adulthood.

00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Cole draws attention
to the battered trees

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and their encounter with
the passage of time,

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:06.340 align:middle line:84%
riven by tempest and cleverly
representing the battle scars

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that the voyager has
encountered in life,

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.300 align:middle line:84%
often described as
the storms of Maya,

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.180 align:middle line:90%
the dark nights of the soul.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Cole has been creative in his
depiction of the demons that

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.080 align:middle line:84%
gather amidst the clouds
above the voyager,

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.980 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that the
evil spirits represent

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:28.725 align:middle line:84%
suicide, intemperance,
and murder, all of which

00:59:28.725 --> 00:59:35.670 align:middle line:84%
are temptations that beset man
and his troubles and suffering.

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:37.850 align:middle line:84%
The demon holds a
cup for the voyager

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to drink from, an
enticing substance created

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.430 align:middle line:90%
from destructive emotion, fear.

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:84%
If the voyager
succumbs to fear, he

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is lost to the demons, waiting
in the shadows to win him over.

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we see
powerful ancient faces

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.180 align:middle line:84%
in the rocks, one of which
is facing toward the sun,

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that the voyager's
journey is being observed

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.430 align:middle line:84%
by far greater and powerful
forces known to man.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Do the rocks know
more than we do?

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
earth is far more in tune

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:21.120 align:middle line:90%
with other realms than man is?

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Cole masterfully
joins heaven and earth

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.710 align:middle line:90%
in the elements at play here.

01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
In the far distant background,
a glimpse of the horizon

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.160 align:middle line:90%
can be seen.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
The serene, clear
sunset-colored sky

01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:34.910 align:middle line:84%
reflects orange and
yellowish browns,

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
depicting autumn in
the late afternoon,

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
at twilight, and representing
hope and salvation.

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
In the trials and
tribulations of life,

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
the angel talks to the soul.

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the soul
is forced to listen.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
When the dark night of
the soul is realized,

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
surrender takes place and
the soul begins to heal,

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
continuing his
journey in preparation

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
of a new test in
the world of matter.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
The major storm is over
in the voyager's life.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Stillness has been found,
and the soul reaches old age

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and prepares to go home.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
Cole's fourth painting,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.240 align:middle line:90%
called "Old Age".

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
A dark winter's
evening is the setting,

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:27.985 align:middle line:84%
and the old man
acknowledges that he

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
is coming to the end of
his life journey on Earth.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
He is slow and weary
and his body is weak.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Cole portrays a finality
of passage for the voyager

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
by using dimming
light and brooding

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
clouds over a vast
midnight ocean.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
A few barren rocks are seen
through the last shores

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.680 align:middle line:84%
These form the mouth of
the river and the boat

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.240 align:middle line:90%
shattered by storms.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Once again, we see the
hidden ancient faces

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
observing the old man, almost
with respect and sadness

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.040 align:middle line:84%
as they watch the
wake of his passing.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
The stream of life
has now reached

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
the ocean, to which
all life is tending.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The world to old age is
destitute of interest.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
There is no longer any
green thing upon it.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
The broken and drooping figures
of the boat, the broken tiller,

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and lost hourglass tells
us that time is nearly

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.830 align:middle line:90%
expired for the elderly voyager.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
The chains of corporal
existence are falling away.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And already, the mind has
glimpses of immortal life.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The old man in the
boat looks upward

01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to an opening in the
clouds, from whence

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
a glorious light bursts
forth, and angels

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
are seen descending
the cloudy steps

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.786 align:middle line:84%
as if to welcome him to
the haven of immortal life.

01:02:55.786 --> 01:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
The old man, with his long white
hair symbolizing earthly wisdom

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
gained along his journey, turns
to his faith for assistance.

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time
as he raises his head,

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
he sees his magnificent
guardian angel very close

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and gently guiding him home.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Cole has achieved
such a beautiful story

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
in these wondrous paintings,
and one that must surely

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
give hope and peace to all
those who live on this Earth

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and experience life, that they
are not alone in their journey.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
An angel emerges from
a portal, a stargate,

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
or a wormhole composed
of concentric rings.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.560 align:middle line:90%
The journey home begins.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
His right hand
rests on his heart,

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and he is at peace
with the world,

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
surrendering the struggle,
and ready to exit the Earth.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
His magnificent time
on Earth is over

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.930 align:middle line:84%
as he journeys to other
worlds, met by loved ones.

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Cole has intrinsically linked
the hero's triumphant salvation

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
to the Christian doctrine
of death and resurrection.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
This extraordinary
artist was not

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
called a master for nothing.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:17.020 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Our soul is, indeed,
an enchanted boat, Clare.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.270 align:middle line:90%
This is "Arcanum".

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:26.350 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:34.944 align:middle line:10%
