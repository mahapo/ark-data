>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:84%
In January 1991, I gathered,
along with the rest

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
of the world, around CNN
and watched US forces

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:84%
on TV storm Kuwait to
save the world from Saddam

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Hussein, the Iraqi dictator.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
That's also when I began reading
the works of Zecharia Sitchin

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Building on the works
of Russian theorists

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
who have studied ancient
contact with extraterrestrials

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
or what they called
paleocontact,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Sitchin famously reinterpreted
ancient Sumerian texts

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
that he claimed told
of extraterrestrials

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
called Anunnaki, or
shining ones, who

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth from a mysterious
previously unknown planet

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
X hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Their base of operation was
Mesopotamia, present day Iraq.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Buried beneath the sands
of Iraq are the secrets

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:90%
of these shining ones.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.335 align:middle line:84%
Reading Sitchin, I
began questioning

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:84%
if there was a connection
between the Gulf War

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient ET
intervention in Iraq.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Did we go there for
reasons other than stopping

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Saddam Hussein and for oil?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
What got me going
was hearing on CNN

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that Saddam Hussein
believed himself

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to be the reincarnated
soul of the biblical

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
King Nebuchadnezzar,
the king of Babylon.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And according to Bible
prophecy, the city of Babylon

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is destroyed near
the end of the age

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
just before the second
coming of Jesus.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:10%
This means it must be
rebuilt. Saddam Hussein

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:10%
spent over $500 million
during the 1980s

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:10%
on the reconstruction and
reestablishment of Babylon

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:10%
in fulfillment of that prophecy.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Could Saddam have really
been this ancient king

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:10%
reincarnated in our world?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Just think about the
implications of that.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.655 align:middle line:84%
In 586 BC, Nebuchadnezzar
destroyed the Temple of Solomon

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
in Jerusalem.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
He looted its
treasure, including

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
He also took 10,000
Jews from Jerusalem

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and held them
captive in Babylon.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
He needed the wise men
of the Temple of Solomon

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to make a golden gadget
that opened a fiery furnace.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Three of these wise men
entered the fiery furnace

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and came back with the
Son of God, as in Jesus,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
in tow, suggesting that this was
actually some kind of a portal.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
In 2002 I broke the story
that Saddam was actually

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
seeking the stargate
of Nebuchadnezzar,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Bush administrations
were out to stop him, again.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Many commentators
picked up on my thesis,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
add any new details

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to the story of
the fiery furnace

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
or portal and its
astounding implications

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that enabled me to make
this original observation.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
more to be told

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of the reincarnation
of Nebuchadnezzar,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:84%
but for now I want to talk
about what the Jews learned

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:90%
while they were in Babylon.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
During their 70 years in Babylon
between 586 BC and 516 BC,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
the exiled Jewish people,
including the ascension

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
prophets Ezekiel
and Daniel, came

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
into contact with
the Zoroastrians

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
from Iran, among other
learned scholars.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And they learned many
new doctrines from them.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Zoroastrianism was founded
by Zarathushtra Spitama

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
of Central Asia.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
He was the first messenger
of the wise supreme

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:90%
being known as Ahura Mazda.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks called him zoro,
meaning shining, astra, meaning

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:90%
star.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And foremost among
his teachings is

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the idea of bodily
resurrection and ascension.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Before their exile
in Babylon, the Jews

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
did not believe
in heaven or hell

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
or in the resurrection
of the body or soul.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
They believed that once
you died or were dead,

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
your soul goes to [HEBREW],
meaning the prison house,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.755 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
end of existence.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.674 align:middle line:84%
But while they were in
Babylon, the Zoroastrians

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Babylonians
taught them about paradise

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and about a final judgment
of all souls and about

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:84%
the resurrection into
new bodies of light.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.165 align:middle line:84%
When the Jews
arrived in Babylon,

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:36.735 align:middle line:84%
they were greeted by the
fabulous site of the Esagila,

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
the lofty house.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This ziggurat was dedicated
to the Mesopotamian god

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Marduk who is portrayed wearing
a robe covered with stars.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:90%
He was a celestial being.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:10%
Also called the house
that lifts its head high,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:10%
the Esagila was his
place of ascension.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
This great ziggurat, meaning
rising building or temple

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
tower of Babylon, was equivalent
to the step pyramid or stairway

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to heaven in
Saqqara, Egypt, where

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
1,500 years before
Nebuchadnezzar,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians operated
a resurrection mystery school

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
under the direction
of the god Ptah

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and where the pharaoh was turned
into a star or a star walker.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Although it is though he
probably never visited Babylon,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
the description of Marduk's
second temple, the Etemenanki,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
provided the Greek
researcher Herodotus

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
in his book "The Histories"
astonishing details

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
about the temple
ritual and its purpose.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Bel, he
said, the Babylonian Zeus,

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
was still in existence in
my time, wrote Herodotus.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It has a solid central
tower, one stadium square,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:84%
with a second erected on
top of it, and then a third,

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:90%
and so on up to eight.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
All eight towers can be
climbed by a spiral way running

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.740 align:middle line:84%
around the outside,
and about halfway up,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:84%
there are seats for those who
make the ascent to rest up.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
On the summit of
the top most tower

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
stands a great temple with
a fine large couch in it,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
richly covered, and a
golden table beside it.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The shrine contains
no image, and no one

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
spends the night in there
except one Babylonian woman,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
all alone.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
However, it may be that
the god has chosen her

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
for a specific reason.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.525 align:middle line:84%
The Chaldeans say, though
Herodotus didn't believe them,

00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that the god, Marduk himself,
enters the temple in person

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:90%
and takes his rest upon the bed.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
What Herodotus had a
hard time believing

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that Marduk,
a celestial being, a god,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
manifests as a
human in his temple.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
his intention is

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.044 align:middle line:84%
to disrobe and lay with a
human female of his choice.

00:07:03.044 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
It's assumed that
he wants to have

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
sexual intercourse with
her, but it's also possible

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
that he wanted to take her
to the celestial realms

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%
through the stargate tower.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The ziggurat is a
cosmic pole, a ladder,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
or a mountain that leads to
heaven where the gods Marduk,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Samas, Adad, and others dwell at
the throne of the supreme god,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:90%
whose name is Anu.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Today, we call such
a place a stargate.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:84%
This Etemenanki ascension
tower of ancient Babylon

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
served as the backdrop for
one of the greatest spiritual

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and literary revolutions
the world has ever seen.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It began when the Jewish
mystics returned to Jerusalem

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
during the fourth century
BC and came into contact

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
with these teachings.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.590 align:middle line:84%
These teachings
came into fruition

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.360 align:middle line:84%
at the time of
Jesus, who is shown

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
ascending from a spiraling
mountain that highly resembles

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:90%
the bell tower of Babylon.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
We see Jesus entering
the portal of the sun

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and becoming one
with all that is.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
In her book "Ascent to Heaven in
Jewish Christian Apocalypses,"

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Yale scholar Martha
Himmelfarb chronicles how

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:84%
after the Babylonian captivity,
especially during the three

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
centuries before
Jesus, the belief that

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the boundary between humanity
and the divine, the realm

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of the gods, is permeable.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And this belief
became widespread

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Mesopotamian world.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Until that time, there
was a perceived boundary

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
between heaven and earth that
was uncrossable by human souls

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:90%
unless invited.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
This meant that only a few
souls actually ascended.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But after the
Babylonian captivity,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
a variety of texts
and literature

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
began to show human beings
routinely crossing the boundary

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.375 align:middle line:90%
or ascending.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
A rebellion began.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the cosmic
egg cracked open.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Stargate earth was
open for business.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And the volume, the
number of these texts,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
makes it clear that a
large number of humans

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
crossed this
boundary or ascended.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Avatars such as Apollonius of
Tyana, a student of Pythagoras,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
who was born into the
same world as Jesus

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and whose miraculous feats
have been compared to him,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
began to teach ascension
to the throne of God

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:90%
as a practical reality.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Assuredly, many
more we have never

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
heard of attempted
this great feat.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
One secret of
boundary crossing is

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
that by reciting the stories
of the visionary ascents

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
of past ascenders, one could
you repeat the visionary ascent

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
of the past ascenders.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Himmelfarb tells
us that simply reading

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
about the ascension
in these texts

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:90%
is powerful in and of itself.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
The stories are
visualization and mind maps.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
This is more than just
a thought experiment.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:84%
As one thinks about
it and visualizes

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
or replicates their
ascension in their mind,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
one begins to live their
ascension in advance.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Just thinking about our
ascension builds anticipation.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It concretizes it in our minds.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this suggests
that these texts are coded

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:90%
to tap the mythic imagination.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.080 align:middle line:84%
A whole body of Jewish
and Christian literature

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.280 align:middle line:84%
called Merkabah mysticism
emerged at this time,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and comprises what may be
thought of as flight simulation

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:84%
training manuals or
boundary crossing

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
for the ascent of the soul
manuals, manuals that teach us

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
how to ascend to
the divine throne,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
traveling through the
halls or holes of space

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:90%
on our souls wind ring.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I refer to these taxes as
ascension simulation texts.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I once had a conversation
with a fighter pilot

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
who said you have
to simulate it to be

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
able to do it in real life.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what
we're describing, repeating

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
over and over in our minds
the path of ascension

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
so that when we actually
ascend, we are prepared and know

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:90%
exactly what to do.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
These texts actually can take
us to the stars in this way.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that these
ascension secrets may still

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
be buried in Iraq,
unless someone found them

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
like Saddam Hussein, or
perhaps someone else.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely mind
boggling to think

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that Saddam Hussein really was
a case of reincarnation playing

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:90%
out right before our very eyes.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's even more
tantalizing to think

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that the secrets of
ascension may still

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:90%
be out there to be discovered.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
One thing is clear-- these
secrets appear to have

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:90%
originated with the Anunnaki.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't know this

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
because they've been distracted
in a way by Sitchin's theory

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki came here
not to teach us ascension

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
but in search of some
mysterious blue stones and gold

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:84%
to repair the decaying
atmosphere of their home

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.910 align:middle line:84%
planet, and that they created
humans as a slave race

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.790 align:middle line:90%
to do this work for them.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
While Sitchin's theory
is not supported

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
by the Sumerian text,
which say nothing

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
about the Anunnaki
coming to Earth for gold,

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
virtually all open minded
historical and theological

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
scholars do agree that the Old
Testament's book of Genesis

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
was extracted from older
Sumerian records, the stories

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:90%
of the Anunnaki.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
The Enuma Elis, the Sumerian
epic of creation for example,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and the book of Genesis have
a variety of common elements.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Stories about great flood and
a deluge, among other stories,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
are also common to both
Sumerian and biblical accounts,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
as are the appearance
of otherworldly beings.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:84%
The conflict in these
accounts is always

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
about human ascension.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
One faction wants to
see humans ascend even

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to the level of the
gods, but the other

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.590 align:middle line:84%
wants to keep us as
slaves and sex objects.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerian records
recorded in great detail

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
the stories of these
celestial Anunnaki.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:10%
And among these we learn
especially the story of Enki

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.280 align:middle line:10%
and Enlil, Ninki, Inanna,
Utu, Ngeshtin-ana,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:10%
Marduk, and many others.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Chief among these stories
was the continuing conflict

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
between Enki and Elul, the
sons of the supreme god Anu.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And much of ancient
human history

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and the biblical
book of Genesis can

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:84%
be explained as the conflicts
between these two half brothers

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they affected the
life of all sentient beings

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It was Enki who sought
to uplift humanity

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
to the level of the gods.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
He was later demonized
as the serpent of Eden.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
It was Enlil who sought to keep
us limited in our abilities.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Ancient astronaut
theorists as they're called

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and proponents of ancient
alien intelligent design

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
propose that the evidence
strongly advocates the concept

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that Adam and Eve and their
ancestors, their cousins,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
were created by
genetic engineering

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and mixing the DNA
of the Anunnaki

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
with that of Homo
erectus, the reigning

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:90%
progenitor of man at that time.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
For years I was enamored by
the story of the Anunnaki,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and I greatly
admire Mr. Sitchin.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
He was a true curmudgeon.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But then I began
lecturing with him,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and did so numerous
times with him

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
around the world at conferences,
up until his death in 2010.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
For millions, his
theories became a tower

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
that enabled them to rise high
and see further into our past.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But then that tower began
to be eroded by scholar

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
after scholar who were quite
contentious about Sitchin's

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%
theories.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
For me, the story of
them, the Anunnaki

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:84%
coming to Earth to mine
gold, just didn't add up.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It didn't make sense to me that
these advanced beings would

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
come clear across
the solar system

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
just for gold and those
mysterious blue stones.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that gold is a rare
commodity in the universe,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
but the Anunnaki
are supposed to have

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.065 align:middle line:84%
been at least the level of
technological advancement

00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:06.850 align:middle line:90%
that we are today.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're less than 100 years
from warp drives, a la Star

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Trek, and nanofabrication.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But the Anunnaki had to
come here in rocket ships

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to create a slave
race to mine gold?

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Didn't believe that.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
What triggered my doubt
was Sitchin's assertion

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that Enki, the god who retooled
our DNA, was also an alchemist.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And alchemists,
we know, endeavor

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to turn base metals into gold.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So why didn't Enki simply
grab a hunk of space rock

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and transmute it?

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The reason I propose is
because the higher actual goal

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
of an alchemist is to turn
our leaden soul into pure gold

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
through a process
of self-purification

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:90%
and self-realization.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It was then that I realized
that this story told in poetry

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
is a parable for purifying
in the ascent of the soul.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:10%
The story of the Anunnaki
is about them coming here

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:10%
to assist us in our
ascension into the stars.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is humanity's
oldest story.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So abandoning or diverting
from Sitchin's they

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.709 align:middle line:84%
came for gold
hypothesis, I propose

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki actually
came here on a mission

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to help us to purify our
souls and to assist us

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in our transformation
or ascension

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:90%
into celestial beings.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And I began to seek evidence
that they tweaked our DNA

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
to make the human body
a more conducive vehicle

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:90%
for the soul's ascension.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The great work that
we did for the gods

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:90%
was not about mining gold.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It was about lifting our
soul out of this realm.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note
that in Sitchin's theory,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the pretext of the Anunnaki
was a cosmic cataclysm.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Two planets, one called Tiamat,
the other called An or Nibiru,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
but referred to as Planet
X, collided, leaving

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:90%
one of these planets shattered.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
this confrontation,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Tiamat was split in two.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
One half of Tiamat
became the asteroid belt.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.420 align:middle line:90%
The other half became Earth.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:27.393 align:middle line:84%
Earth is the daughter of Tiamat,
if not Tiamat reincarnated.

00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
The Babylonians
called Tiamat "Mer"

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and believed that
it was from her

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that the original matter that
formed the Earth was created.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Various myths say
that Tiamat or "Mer"

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
produced the fluid of creation,
which was blood or DNA.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:84%
By splitting or
dividing Tiamat in two,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:84%
this marauding planet
released an ocean of blood

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:90%
into the cosmos.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
But blood is lifeless
without soul.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So what if Tiamat also
released souls into the cosmos?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
What happened to those souls?

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Are we those souls?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The ancients tell us
that Tiamat was once one

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiades, a star cluster
in the constellation Taurus

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:90%
the bull.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the Cherokee
Indians of East Tennessee

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
say that we were
created by light beings

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
from the please who wrote
a sound way through a hole

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
in space over East Tennessee
and created the Cherokee

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
as guardians of one
of 12 vortexes spread

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
It's crucial to note
that the ancients used

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
a dove, a symbol of the
soul, as a symbol for Tiamat.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Babylonians called the
Pleiades the flock of ducks.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks called
them the Atlantides.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the annual
Babylonian reenactment

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
of the splitting of
Tiamat and its Atlantis

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
like sinking into the
waters of the night,

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:84%
a dove was split in
half in imitation

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:90%
of Nibiru splitting of Tiamat.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
In Sumerian myth,
Nibiru split Tiamat

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
into two parts, upper
waters and lower waters.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew scribes
recorded that their god

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
divided the waters that
were under the firmament

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
from the waters that
were above the firmament,

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:90%
a perfect correlation.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:84%
This sounds to me like
the souls of Tiamat,

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
this cosmic Atlantis
if you will,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
were roaming free
in the cosmic ocean,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps they were
attached to the sunken planet

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and they needed to be rescued.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Enter the Anunnaki.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
As told in the Atra-Hasis, an
18th century BC Akkadian epic,

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:84%
our earthly bodies were
created by this god Enki

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
from the flesh and blood
of a rebel god named Kingu

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:90%
who was envisioned as a dragon.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And Kingu was
actually considered

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:90%
to be a son of Tiamat.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Enki in this scenario was
the leader of the Anunnaki,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and he was sent here on
a soul rescue mission.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:10%
His companion,
the goddess Nintu,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:10%
mixed Kingu's spirit,
which she pulled

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:10%
from his flesh and blood, with
the clay, or DNA, of the earth.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Berossus, an ancient
historian, says

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that Kingu's life was mixed
with the blood of the earth,

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.980 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that that
clay could indeed

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%
be a reference to blood or DNA.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
says Berossus,

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:84%
men are intelligent and have
a share of divine wisdom.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Or is it rather than we have
a share of the divine soul?

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to
the ancient Sumerian

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
epic of Gilgamesh,
dating from 2,100 BC,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
we are 2/3 divine
and one third human.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Seen here is an original copy
of this epic from the Chicago

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Oriental museum.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
In the story, we are
told of our divinity,

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and we are told that Kingu
was the son of the goddess

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Tiamat, who was slain by Enki's
son Marduk, the storm god.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.455 align:middle line:84%
Some authors describe Tiamat
as a serpent or dragon.

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And here is the reptilian
code once again.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
In the fantastic Babylonian
creation epic the Enuma Elis,

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Tiamat gives birth to
serpents and dragons.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And from Tiamat's
slain body, Marduk

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
took the prized
tablets of destiny

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and then transformed
it into the universe.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
These tablets are
believed to be made

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of the mysterious blue stones
sought by the Anunnaki,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and may in fact be the original
mystical or cosmic matter out

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:90%
of which Tiamat was made.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So Enki was the god who was
called or sent in to clean up

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:90%
the mess of this cosmic event.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Why Enki?

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Was it because he
was a geneticist?

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That's part of it, but Sumerian
scholar Samuel Noah Kramer

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
says that Enki also
knows the way in and out

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
of the world below and the
afterlife world of the dead.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.980 align:middle line:84%
That means that
Enki knows his way

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:90%
around the world of the soul.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:90%
He is a soul specialist.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And navigating the
afterlife is actually

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.445 align:middle line:84%
the concern or specialty
of Enki's priests, who

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:46.680 align:middle line:84%
are called the Apkallu These
incredible sagely beings appear

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
dressed in fish robes
or scaly garments.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
This cloak is a symbol
for their awakened status

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
as swimmers or dwellers
of the cosmic ocean.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:84%
The Apkallu were personified
as traditionally seven culture

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:84%
heroes sent by Enki
to teach mankind

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
the arts of civilization
and the secrets of heaven,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of soul ascension.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the ultimate
secret of the Anunnaki.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the Apkallu
is called Oannes.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
He ascended to heaven
where he met the great god

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Anu on his throne.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And he famously was
offered the secret

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of the mortality of the gods,
the Anunnaki, but refused it.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We note that these
wise beings carry

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:90%
what appear to be hand bags.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
This actually tame these
mysterious heavenly

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
blue stones or tablets, referred
to as the heavenly book,

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.800 align:middle line:84%
that are described in Near
Eastern ascension stories.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
After creating human kind and
up leveling our soul awareness,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Enki was summoned to
heaven by the other gods

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and was punished for
creating the first human.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The first human, called
Adapa, Enki took on the road

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to heaving according to
the Sumerian stories.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Adapa's name means wise.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Assyrian references

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
to the wisdom of Adapa,
he composed a book

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.115 align:middle line:84%
of sciences titled "Writings
Regarding Time From Divine

00:25:22.115 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Anu and Divine Enlil."

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Adapa thus is
credited with writing

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.270 align:middle line:84%
mankind's first
book of astronomy,

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:90%
the calendar, and ascension.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.740 align:middle line:84%
In another story about the
Emmeduranki, the tower that

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:84%
reached into the heavens, we
learned of the king of Sippar,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:84%
where he too was loved by the
gods, especially the sun god

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Samas.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:84%
In this story, Samas sends
him to a secret chamber

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:84%
where he enters the great
golden throne of the gods.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And upon arrival, the
great gods Anu and Enki

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.060 align:middle line:84%
teach him the secrets of
the tablets of the gods,

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the bag with the mystery of
heaven and earth, oil on water,

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and the mysterious cedar staff.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, the tablets are
the symbol of sovereignty

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and contain the
secret of ascension.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.940 align:middle line:84%
They are identical to
the tablets of destiny,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:84%
the tablets of wisdom, the
law of heaven and earth,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:90%
the tablets of the gods.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:84%
They contain the supreme
wisdom about the workings

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.990 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and
the ascension of humans

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
into celestial beings.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
In this story, Emmeduranki
crossed the boundary of heaven

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and brought these
tablets back to Earth.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
He then shared his
knowledge with his family.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So from the stories of Oannes
and Adapa and Emmeduranki,

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
we learn for the first time
that a human being can ascend.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:84%
A human being can cross the
boundary between the material

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
realm of humans and enter the
transcendent, immaterial realm

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, make
an ascent to heaven,

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:84%
see the celestial realms, enter
the secret chamber of the gods,

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:84%
experience the presence
of god, and be transformed

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:84%
into an angel by
that experience,

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and then return to earth
to tell everyone about it

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
and inspire them to
believe that they too

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.435 align:middle line:90%
can take this ultimate journey.

00:27:27.435 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Though we have disputed
or questioned the claim

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:10%
that the Anunnaki came
to Earth for gold,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:10%
we can learn a lot about
the nature of our soul

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:10%
by comparing it to gold.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Technically and
alchemically speaking,

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
gold is a soft, shiny,
yellow, heavy, malleable,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.550 align:middle line:90%
and ductile metal.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It is also a trivalent
or univalent,

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
which means it's a
transitional metal.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
It can phase from
one form to another.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:84%
As a transitional metal,
gold is symbolic of our souls

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
flexibility, and
our own flexibility

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
on our spiritual path
while life experiences

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.320 align:middle line:90%
galvanize our faith.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Because of its resistance
to heat and acid,

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
gold as a symbol of
immutability, eternity,

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and perfection in all
matter on any level.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's for these reasons
that gold symbolizes

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:84%
humankind's quest to perfect,
illuminate, and refine

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We all start out like
Athena in this statute,

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:84%
needing a golden robe or a
coat to complete ourselves.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:10%
This golden code is known as
the golden robe or golden body

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.490 align:middle line:10%
or light body.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:10%
It is seen in the Golden
Fleece of the sacred lamb

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.550 align:middle line:10%
in this tale about the
acquisition of this Golden

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Fleece that is guarded
by the serpent or dragon,

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:10%
the reptilian code again.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, the
perfect body is known

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
as the rainbow body of light.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a plasma body
that is shot with gold.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And attaining the golden body
or light body, we are told,

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:middle line:84%
is our soul's greatest aim
and its ultimate source

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:90%
of protection.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
Anunnaki to thank us

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
for these original
stories that tell us

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:37.010 align:middle line:84%
that we can in fact attain this
incredible state of perfection.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.240 align:middle line:84%
One key to attaining
this perfection

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
is the golden dorje that's
shown here in the Guru

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Padmasambhava's hand.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:84%
This golden dorje stands
for compassion and action.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the
golden key of life

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
to the Tibetans,
compassion and action.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
In Christian symbolism, gold
is considered an attribute

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
or virtue of the soul.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:10%
This gives gold such attributes
as vitality, life, health,

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:10%
radiance, wisdom, clarity,
unification, virtue, and light.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:10%
These are the vibrations
to which the soul aspires.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And as we take
actions in our lives

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:10%
that mirror these vibrations,
we begin to transform ourselves

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.105 align:middle line:10%
into golden beings.

00:30:33.105 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:10%
We embody these virtues.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Golden hues are quite
often used in Christian art

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to convey the concept
of divine love.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:84%
The golden halo in
art is also a symbol

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:90%
of the soul glowing from within.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue in our
quest in the awakened soul,

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn a lot
more about the Anunnaki

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
secrets of putting on this
immaculate robe of light,

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:84%
the robe with the
soul, and their search

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:90%
for this mysterious blue stone.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.710 align:middle line:84%
More, we will seek
this gold within us.

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Until next time, stay humble.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And namaste.
