>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is a star
walker by nature.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Our true home is out
there in the cosmos,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, maybe another
star system, maybe

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:84%
another dimension, maybe just
another galaxy somewhere.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how does this soul

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
travel to these other
dimensions, galaxies,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.660 align:middle line:90%
or star systems?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
In previous episodes,
we introduced

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the cosmic egg
as a method of transport.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And we proposed the
idea that it's actually

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.262 align:middle line:90%
a wormhole opened by the soul.

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
A wormhole is a tunnel or
shortcut through space-time.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
As many of my readers
know, I am a proponent

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
of the idea that our soul can
turn our body into a stargate

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
and then travel the cosmos.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the great secret
of the soul, in fact.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:84%
My path to this
realization began in 2002,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
when on my first
visit to Egypt, I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
had a profound
soul-awakening experience

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
during a visit to the "KIng's"
Chamber of the Great Pyramid.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the
Great Pyramid was

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
viewed by the ancients as
a transfiguration machine,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:90%
or what we call a stargate.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't realize is that
it may still be operational

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and that I could've had
an experience with it.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happened.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
After ascending the pyramid's
Grand Gallery to the King's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Chamber, this incredible
pink granite room,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
we excitedly explored
this amazing space.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, our
group settled down.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I picked a spot,
and I slid my back

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
against the pink granite wall,
closed my eyes to meditate.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I acknowledged where I was,
at the center of the land

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
masses of the Earth in perhaps
the most powerful building ever

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%
conceived on Earth.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And I opened my heart
and began sending love

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to my family, my friends,
and my loved ones.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this
beaming blue eye

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:90%
appeared in my consciousness.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It was alive.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
beaming bliss at me.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I clearly remembered
it, smiling at me,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and can feel that presence
even at this moment.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:90%
It was truly wonderful.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
It was like this beaming
blue eye was playing with me.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, I didn't
know what it was.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And after we left the
pyramid, I asked our group

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
if anyone else had
had that experience.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, no one
had, and they had no clue

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:90%
what I was talking about.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we were in a gift
shop at the museum down

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:90%
in Luxor, Egypt.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And there sitting on a shelf was
a two-inch tall golden pyramid

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.815 align:middle line:84%
with the blue Eye of Horus
placed at the exact location

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:90%
of the King's Chamber.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I saw.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that that was
actually the blue Eye of Horus

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:90%
that had paid me a visit.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I saw
the blue eye depicted

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
on the ceiling at the
Temple of Hathor at Dendera.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
What we see in this
image are the gods

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
ascending a stairway, a
stairway actually to the Moon,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
with the god Thoth who
is beaming energy to them

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
as if he's conducting
this ceremony, bringing

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:90%
their souls to the Moon.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.195 align:middle line:84%
We see, mounted to a ship
eternity, the blue Eye

00:03:33.195 --> 00:03:37.045 align:middle line:90%
of Horus with a soul in its eye.

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It looked to me like the soul
was traveling on the boat

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
into eternity.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of you may have
had a similar experience,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
which I later learned
is sort of an interview.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The ascension texts
of the ancients

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.800 align:middle line:84%
tell us of beings who
are actively seeking

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:90%
candidates for ascension.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And when a soul shows
its signs of readiness,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
the messenger or the
teacher manifests.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
The really comforting
thing about this

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the messenger
is sent to assist us

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
in completing our ascension
by transferring to us the rest

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
of the story, so to speak.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't say
for certain that I

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
was interviewed by a cosmic
messenger in the King's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.504 align:middle line:90%
Chamber that day.

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I was going to spend
the rest of my life trying

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand and
figure out what happened

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and try to return to that
state of extraordinary lists.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no better
place to begin

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to connect with these
ancient ascended beings

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
than to go to the Temple of
Hathor in Dendera in Egypt.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Hathor was the Egyptian
goddess of love and joy.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And on the inside of her temple
is a masterpiece of ancient art

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that portrays the
transformation of a pharaoh

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
into a celestial
being, a starwalker.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
The figure shown riding
on the boat of eternity

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:84%
here is a son of god, a sun
god, a soul star or starwalker

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
who possesses remarkable
afterlife powers

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:90%
and acquires more as he goes.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Since 2004, I've been
cataloging these images

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of the gods
starwalking or surfing

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
on this boat as a regenerated
or born-again being of light,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
a star being, and comparing
them to the modern depictions

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of the star boats scientists
called wormholes or stargates

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that theoretically enable
travel through the galaxy

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:90%
and even to parallel universes.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
The similarities between
the ancient Egyptians'

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
ship of eternity and the
wormhole shape are eye-popping.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely perfect.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:10%
Egyptologists say that this
boat is merely the Sun.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, I accept this
partial interpretation,

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:10%
so long as it's accompanied by
the ancient Egyptian conception

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.480 align:middle line:10%
of the Sun not only as
the light of the world,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:10%
but also as a star tunnel,
or stargate through which we

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.326 align:middle line:10%
travel to the heavenly realms.

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Further, the River Nile,
this sun boat sails upon,

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is the heavenly
Nile, the Milky Way,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
the river of stars
of the divine lady,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.315 align:middle line:84%
Isis or Hathor who became Mary
in the Christian tradition.

00:06:25.315 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the wormhole
is the primordial symbol

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:90%
of symbols.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
A wormhole connects
our universe to itself

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and us to the universe.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:10%
It also symbolizes our soul's
incarnation, our lives.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:10%
We all experience an inhuman
past, a present life,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.000 align:middle line:10%
and a future.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:10%
So in this way, the wormhole
symbol is the map of our life.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Notice that the blue
dot in the middle,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:10%
or throat, of the
wormhole, that symbolizes

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:10%
the passage of our life.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Thinking of that
blue dot, can you

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
imagine a seed essence
within yourself,

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
a divine blue particle,
also called a cosmic egg,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
a blue apple, a blue
stone, a blue pearl that

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
blossoms into a new skin, maybe
a blue skin, or light body

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
garment and opens
gateways in space

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:84%
but allow instant access
to other star systems

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
or even galaxies
billions of miles away,

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
paths that take us
back to the source?

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine your
body as this stargate

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
from your soul's perspective?

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
The key to thinking of
your body has a stargate

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
from the soul's perspective is
to recognize that it's an error

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
to view a human body, the vessel
of our soul, as an object.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Even modern science
now recognizes

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
that our body is not a fixed
object, but it's a process.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Several trillion
cellular animals,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
each of them changing
nanosecond by nanosecond,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
work cooperatively
to create our body.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
According to physicist Fritz
Popp, a German researcher

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
in biophysics, the most
basic submolecular component

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
of our body is made
up of particles

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
of light called biophotons.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
These biophotons make up the
electromagnetic frequency

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:84%
patterns that are found
in all living organisms.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The photon has been
called a wavicle,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's either
a particle or a wave,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
you expect it to be.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy the work
of Jonathan Zap,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.410 align:middle line:84%
who observed that some
physicists have suggested

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
are like the wavicle.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
If you view a human being
as an object, a particle,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
then you experience the
mortal physical body

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
as all there is and will tend
towards the meat-puppet view

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
of neurological
materialism, as he says.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
However, if you view the
human body as a soul,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
then you experience the
wave-like spirit body

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and will tend towards a
mystical, religious point

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
However, to see the
full human being,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
you must flip back and forth
between these points of view,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.550 align:middle line:84%
until you're able to experience
that human beings are

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.775 align:middle line:84%
both particle-like, physical
bodies, and wave-like, energy

00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
No one has actually
seen a photon.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But there are those, including
artist John Henrik Anderson

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and a team of physicists
at the University

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of Michigan, who in my view
depict the photon as a toroidal

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
or doughnut shaped in
the shape of a cosmic egg

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:84%
with the wormhole into which all
structures from this dimension

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
eventually dissolve
and quite possibly out

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
of which all structures
continuously evolve.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about this is

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
that, in early Christian
art, the Christ child

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
was shown in a cosmic
egg, in this case blue.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
That blue egg, or blue
sphere, is actually

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:90%
a bubble for transport.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that it
signifies a wormhole.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful, early example
comes from Saint Catherine's

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Monastery in Sinai.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It's from Egypt, and
it's circa 550 AD.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
What we see in this example from
the sixth century in Byzantium

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
is an example of a mosaic
of the Transfiguration,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
of the grown Jesus in
which is surrounded

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
by a mandala, or mandorla,
a gateway of blue light.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a seventh
century example

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
of Christ enthroned on a
rainbow in a cosmic egg filled

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:90%
with stars.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Can we see this
is as a stargate?

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
The egg or blue sphere is
often filled with stars.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:84%
These two images that
we're looking at here

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
actually tell the
exact same story.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
The one on the left
from Dendera, Egypt,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
shows a profile
view, or a side view,

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
of a transformed human soul
riding the ship of eternity.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:10%
Symbolically, the Son of
God on a throne mounted

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:10%
to a wormhole from Dendera
is exactly the same as Jesus,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:10%
only shown face on, on the
throne amidst a gate of stars.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:10%
If we go to Ravenna, Italy, we
find these incredible mosaics

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:10%
depicting Christ and the
angels on blue spheres.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:10%
This blue sphere is
described by shamans

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:10%
as a sort of quantum
egg that the soul uses

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:10%
to phase in and
out of our reality,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:10%
again suggesting that
the blue sphere is

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:10%
a method of transport.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Not just Christ, but also angels
travel upon these blue spheres.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And from this art,
we can clearly

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:84%
get the idea that the
blue sphere is some form

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:90%
of a portal or a gateway.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
These blue eggs also
symbolized the power

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the power
of Resurrection itself.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Angels, or ascended beings,
hold this power in their hands.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And they, ultimately,
offer it to us

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.265 align:middle line:90%
as part of our soul's ascension.

00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the
blue sphere or egg

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most intriguing
of all Christian symbols,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
for it is upon this blue sphere
that the cosmic Christ will

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.050 align:middle line:84%
appear at Judgment Day
or the Second Coming.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
As we note here, blue
angels compose the egg

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and will also appear with him.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a favorite example from
Egypt in the fourth century.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:10%
Egypt, of course, is
the esoteric birthplace

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.075 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity.

00:12:59.075 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Saint Catherine's Monastery
on Mount Sinai, Egypt,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.230 align:middle line:84%
was home to artists,
who sought to capture

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.155 align:middle line:84%
the ethereal blue light of
heaven via their inspired icons

00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and clearly left the message
that these blue spheres

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:84%
are gateways or portals
into other realms.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
This quest or concept was also
expressed in Constantinople,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
where artists created these
lovely images of portals

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
to the divine realm, as
well as icons of such power

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that the new religion of Islam
felt so threatened by them,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that its elders had
these icons destroyed.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The icons were themselves viewed
a sacred mirrors, portals,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.630 align:middle line:84%
or gateways into
the divine realm.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
They were viewed as tools for
spiritual practice, whereby

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
anybody could engage in
the sacred or holy light

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and open a portal or a gateway.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, a few of these
early, stunning examples

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.670 align:middle line:90%
have survived.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're seeing here.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the Egyptian theme of
Christ in a blue sphere sitting

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
on a throne found
its way into Italy,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
where Christ is shown
wearing the robe of light.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The strange thing about all
this is-- actually, strangely

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
wonderful-- is that Swami
Muktananda, a guru who

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
has written of the blue pearl
and also founded the Siddha

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Yoga tradition, writes of
the blue pearl in hauntingly

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
similar terms to what
we see in these images.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.720 align:middle line:84%
He refers to the blue
pearl as the divine light

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
an aspect of the soul.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And he says, it dwells
within everyone.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Connection with it,
says Muktananda,

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most significant
of all spiritual experiences

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:90%
that one can have.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.935 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if that's what
I, in fact, experienced

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Muktananda describes
how, at one point,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
he experienced this blue
pearl expand until it became

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
the size of a human being.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
He saw a magnificent being
made of shimmering blue light.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And this blue being gave him
some advice and a blessing

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and then reduced in
size to the blue pearl

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and entered into Muktananda.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
The blue being, the embodiment
of God consciousness,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is made of an extraordinary
light, says Swami Muktananda.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And just as consciousness
expands or pulsates

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and pervades the
entire universe,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and once again
contracts, similarly,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the blue being, consciousness,
the great light,

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
once again becomes
the blue pearl

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
as tiny as a sesame or mustard
seed and reenters the body.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So think about this--
the possibility

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that these extraordinary
beings are traveling the cosmos

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
in these tiny orbs of light,
blue light, blue spheres, that

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
can enter into our
bodies, or even before us,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and open up into the
size of a wormhole,

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that we perhaps
could step through

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.495 align:middle line:84%
or that they themselves
could enter into our bodies.

00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Muktananda teaches that this
exquisite and enchanting

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:84%
blue light is said to
contain the seed of the heart

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
and contains the whole universe.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And he says that the goal
of meditation in the Siddha

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
practice, this yogic practice,
is to see the blue pearl

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately, to go
inside it and merge with it--

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:90%
in other words, to ascend.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this blue
sphere is the soul itself.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And within this blue
pearl or blue sphere,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
you will see the deity
you have personal devotion

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to-- be it Ptah, or Jesus,
Buddha, Sai Baba, Krishna,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Rama.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:10%
This incredible painting,
"The Man in Sapphire Blue"

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:10%
by Hildegard of Bingen portrays
Jesus as that blue being,

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:10%
but it could be any divine
being that we can imagine.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus
says in John 14:6,

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
"I am the way, and the
truth, and the life.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And no one comes to the
Father except through me."

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
What if Jesus
literally means that he

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.510 align:middle line:84%
will manifest in a blue
sphere as a blue being

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and open a portal
to take one home.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
We see this characterized in
Russian Last Judgment or Second

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Coming art, where we see Jesus
riding on the blue sphere.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Once again, it is
clearly meant to be

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.846 align:middle line:84%
a method of transport or
manifestation for this being.

00:17:48.846 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
The blue sphere, in
my view, is something

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
akin to a wormhole or a stargate
used by the ascended ones.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And this is shown over and
over again in Christian art.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:10%
According to the Gnostic
text, the blue Oracle,

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:10%
this divine being, is within
the divine core of every human.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And it is the job of the Oracle,
actually our higher self,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to awaken our awareness
of the immortal core

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and our divine particle with its
spiritual potential imprinted

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But this immortal core, this
blue sphere, this blue pearl

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:90%
is guarded by the dragon.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:10%
And it covets this divine
sphere or blue pearl.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This is why cracking the
reptilian code is essential.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:84%
This ascension has a very
interesting demon within it.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
These demons, or
reptilian-type beings,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.052 align:middle line:90%
are always near the cosmic egg.

00:18:52.052 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:84%
For another example, we turn
to Padmasambhava, the Guru

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Rinpoche of Tibetan
tradition and who's

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
an emanation of the Amitabha,
the celestial Buddha

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:84%
of the pure land,
who's show here

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
holding a blue lotus,
which is traditionally

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
interpreted as a symbol
of gentleness and purity.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's also akin to our
blue sphere, our blue pearl,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and the blue apple.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava is shown
here holding the patra,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:90%
or begging bowl.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He also meditates on the
triple dot Chintamani

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
symbol, which opens the Rainbow
Bridge into the higher realms.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The Chintamani is
also on his cloak,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
indicating his body is made
of spiritual stuff of light

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
or the mystic light of
the Chintamani stone.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
This same cloak is the
one we saw worn by Jesus

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:84%
just a moment ago, as he sits
on the throne in the blue sphere

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
or the blue pearl.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava was
a celestial avatar,

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
who taught the great
perfection or rainbow

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
body of light empowerment in
Tibet in the eighth century.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body of light
is the robe of the soul,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's attained
by accelerating

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the
body, until it dissolves

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
into five-colored rainbow light,
leaving behind only hair, toe,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and fingernails, which have
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans tell us
that this teaching

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
is taught in 13 star
systems including our own.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
All of them are
connected probably

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:90%
by a system of wormholes.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And once we ourselves
attain the rainbow body,

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
this teaching suggests,
we are able then

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to travel to these
other 13 star systems

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and that there are
beings coming and going

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
from these star systems bringing
these teachings to Earth.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
There are many
stories explaining how

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Guru Padmasambhava was born.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're worth
taking a look at.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Some say that he
instantly appeared

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
on the peak of Meteorite
Mountain in Sri Lanka.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Others teach that he came
through his mother's womb.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But most accounts refer
to a miraculous birth,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
explaining that he spontaneously
appeared as an eight-year-old

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:90%
boy in the center of a Lotus.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
When I hear a
story like this, it

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
makes me wonder if
Padmasambhava could

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
be in another representative
from an advanced civilization

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that travels the
stars via wormholes,

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
because as we have seen,
the lotus symbolizes

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.020 align:middle line:90%
the ship of eternity.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So why couldn't
Padmasambhava have

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
manifested as an eight-year-old
boy through the wormhole.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
To achieve illumination,
or experience

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Buddha nature and
the rainbow body,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
we're taught that
we must meditate

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
on the blue pearl, the jewel in
the heart of the golden Lotus,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:90%
as it's referred to.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
This is the meaning
of Om Mani Padme

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Hum, the Buddhist mantra that
calls down divine blessings.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Buddhists teach that through
regular and prolonged

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:84%
meditation and focus on
the blue pearl, or actually

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:84%
the blue sphere, in
our own consciousness,

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
one gradually experiences
their true nature.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:90%
This is called Buddha nature.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And it represents attainment
of the rainbow body of light,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:90%
as we see here.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
Padmasambhava is shown here

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:90%
meditating on the blue pearl.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to make a
screenshot of this image,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
take a picture with
your cell phone,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and make it the home page on
your website or on your phone

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and meditate on
this image daily.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We're told that each of us on
average looks at our cellphone

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:90%
200 times a day.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So what if you looked at
this image 200 times a day

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and reminded yourself of
the blue pearl within you

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility that
this blue parole can

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
open a portal or gateway into
the higher dimensional realms.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So once again, is it
possible that there

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:84%
exists this super-advanced
race of beings

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:84%
who traveled the stars and
long ago came to Earth?

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Even NASA predicts that 100
million worlds in our own Milky

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Way galaxy may host alien life.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And space program
scientists estimate

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that humans will be able
to find life out there

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
within two decades.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.007 align:middle line:84%
If so, how might these
beings travel here?

00:23:20.007 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
We're told spaceships could
be out of the question

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
due to the distances
between star systems.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We're less than 100
years away, NASA

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
says, from developing
a warp craft that

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
could take us to our nearest
star system, Alpha Centauri.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:84%
In a rocket ship, this journey
would take 75,000 years.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:84%
However, in a warp
craft, that journey

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:90%
could be made in just two weeks.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
But another scenario
has been put forth

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:90%
by science writer John Cramer.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And it fits with our blue
sphere and wormhole discussion.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.020 align:middle line:10%
Cramer begins with
the assumption

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:10%
that any such
advanced civilization

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:10%
would be able to snatch
microscopic wormholes

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:10%
from the quantum foam that make
up the fabric of space-time

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:10%
and would be able
to stabilize them.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
This civilization would
then be able to hold open

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
one end of the wormhole
in a stable place

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
but aim the other end of
it at a place of interest,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.470 align:middle line:84%
say a star or a planet,
and then beam it there.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Cramer says that
traveling slightly less

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light, the
wormhole mouth, which behaves,

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
he says, very much like a
particle in this scenario,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.070 align:middle line:84%
could be manipulated as it
travels through the cosmos,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:90%
correcting course as needed.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Back in the lab,
the wormhole mouth

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
at the other end, the
one that stayed home,

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
would act like a peephole
into the universe.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So what he's asking
us to imagine here

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
is a blue sphere that's sent
through the cosmos, that,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in fact, is one end of
the mouth of a wormhole

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and that this scheme would
allow super-fast travel

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
through the cosmos, as well as
colonization of star systems.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Cramer contemplates
the possibility

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.445 align:middle line:84%
that some advanced
civilization may

00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:84%
be mapping the galaxy with
accelerated wormholes, sending

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
them out into the
cosmos as peepholes

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
for exploring universe,
again the blue sphere

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:90%
being these peepholes.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, when a particularly
promising or interesting scene

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
comes into view, the peephole
is halted and expanded

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
into a portal through which
a visitor from the home world

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
can pass or through
which an individual

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:41.841 align:middle line:84%
on the planet under observation
could enter into as well.

00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
While this sounds sci-fi,
as Cramer points out,

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
physicists have
actually observed

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:84%
super-energetic
cosmic ray anomalies

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that could be explained
by this wormhole theory.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic rays are charged
subatomic particles

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
origin with sources,

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:84%
including the Sun and
other stars, or supernovas.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
In what are called
Centauro events,

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
cosmic ray particles with
incredibly high energy

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
strike the Earth and
produce a large shower

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
of particles that
are way beyond normal

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and bear the signature of an
accelerated wormhole mouth.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:25.750 align:middle line:10%
These particles may have been
deliberately aimed at Earth.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:10%
So if our blue sphere equals
a wormhole analogy holds,

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.640 align:middle line:10%
humans would experience
extraterrestrial beings first

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:10%
as tiny blue spheres,
or flashes of blue light

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:46.400 align:middle line:10%
orbs that can open
into whole beings.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:84%
What if, as our
consciousness evolves here

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and we get a firm
understanding of wormholes

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and these blue light
beings, that we

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
will begin to see masses of blue
spheres at some future point.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, it may be
that the orb phenomena

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that so many are experiencing
when they take pictures

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with their digital cameras
and they see these highly

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
detailed orbs with
concentric rings,

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're an early
manifestation of such an event.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
People have actually reported
seeing beings inside these orbs

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that they catch with
their digital cameras.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Or as the ancients
suggest, this orb

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
may, in fact, be the
way our soul will

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:90%
travel into the cosmos.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
To me, contemplating this
possibility is beyond exciting.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And my greatest wish is
that all of you one day

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
will find yourself in
a peaceful location--

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to be the King's
Chamber of the Great Pyramid;

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it could be some
other sacred location;

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
it could even happen
in your living room--

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and that perhaps one
of these blue flashes,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
be it a blue eye, a blue
orb, or a blue angel,

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
will manifest in
your consciousness

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps open up a
gateway or a wormhole that

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:90%
will be able to take you home.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Until then, be humble.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.
