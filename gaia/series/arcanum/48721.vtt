>>WILLIAM HENRY: Have
you ever wondered

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.490 align:middle line:84%
what the human body was
really designed to do

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.480 align:middle line:84%
or is capable of
doing spiritually?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE HENRY: On this
episode of "Arcanum,"

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:84%
we investigate the human
rainbow body of light.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Our
exploration of arcanum

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.820 align:middle line:84%
has seen the repetition
of three key symbols:

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
a stone, a rod or a staff,
and a cloak of light.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The stone is
the Philosopher's Stone.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
The rod is the caduceus
or staff of life.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
The cloak is the
garment of light.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: In
Western civilization,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
the quest for arcanum begins
with humanity's eviction

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
of Adam and Eve from
the Garden of Eden.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.465 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament god Yahweh
made a gate at the east of Eden

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and placed a flashing,
flaming sword in its center.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Humans were forbidden
to cross through the gate.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Next, the Bible says,
the Old Testament god Yahweh

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
made coats of skin for humanity.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And these are assumed
to be animal skins.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: However, in the
esoteric or mystical tradition,

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:90%
the skin is human skin.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Mystics believe that Adam
and Eve were originally

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
beings of light.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Rabbinical
tradition also

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
says that Adam and Eve were
covered with a cloud of glory,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
meaning they glowed
rainbow rays.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Adam's
garment is identical

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to the celestial
robes of the righteous

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
in the Jewish and Christian
mystery tradition.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: It is described as
a shining garment or garment

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: It was of extraordinary
brilliance and splendor.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And because of it,
Adam and Eve possessed

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:90%
supernatural qualities.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: This glowing
rainbow body was taken away

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
from humanity, mystics say,
and our goal is to reclaim it.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: In the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes proclaimed
the faithful were

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:84%
to receive life everlasting
and a crown of glory

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and a robe of honor
amid light perpetual.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Is it
possible that Adam

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and Eve's glorious
and glowing garment

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
is the original body of
light within all of us?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: In William's
feature investigation,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
we will explore the mystical
teaching that tells us

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are all in the process
of morphing into a higher form.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
In one lifetime,
we can transform

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
or morph into what they call
the rainbow body of light.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM: My
investigation or awareness

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:10%
of the rainbow body of
light or cloak of light

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:10%
began in 1999 with this enticing
drawing of the baptism of Jesus

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:10%
from Winchester, England.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:10%
In the drawing or in the
scene, we see John the Baptist

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:10%
attuning Jesus to the higher
vibration of the Holy Spirit,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:10%
and an angel is
standing by to give him

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:10%
his new cloak or
garment of light.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:10%
When I first saw
this, I was transfixed

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:10%
by this process, this
attunement, this imagery.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:10%
And it prompted me to do wonder,
what is this cloak of light

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus is receiving?

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:10%
We know it was referred
to as a miracle garment

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:10%
because after he
put on this garment,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:10%
he was able to
perform the miracles.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Symbolic of putting on new
clothing, this garment of light

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
represents a seal or
a garment of light

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that enabled Jesus to move into
this dimension in a new way.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:10%
Thus, later Easter
traditions of Whitsunday

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:10%
became the later
Easter tradition

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:10%
of giving and
getting new clothing.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:10%
This is why we dress up
our children in new clothes

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:10%
at Easter time.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:10%
It symbolizes the acquisition
of this new garment of light.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
he demonstrated,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Jesus did, at the
transfiguration.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
After receiving it, he
showed the disciples

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
what was possible with
this garment of light.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It's described as the robe of
light, the robe of sanctity,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the robe of glory, the shining
garment, the garment of light,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
the beaming garment, and
the rainbow body of light.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
The Greek word that
describes it is Exousia.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It means authority,
jurisdiction, liberty, power,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:84%
right to act, ability,
privilege, capacity,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
emerged in my mind

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
was, well, where did John
the Baptist get the cloak?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is is
that John, it is claimed,

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
was the reincarnation of
Elijah, the prophet who was last

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:84%
seen ascending into the
heavens in a whirlwind.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And as John is ascending in
this classically rendered icon

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
depicting the
ascension of Elijah,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
he transmits this holy
garment to his priest, Elisha.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And then later, Elijah
incarnates as John the Baptist,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and he goes and
reclaims this garment.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:10%
So from these bits and pieces
that I started assembling,

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.130 align:middle line:10%
I began to realize that
this garment symbolizes

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:10%
a transmittable
teaching or perhaps

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:10%
a vibration that enables us
to ascend into the heavens.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:10%
Now in the ancient world,
they called the ascension

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:10%
into the heavens
via a whirlwind.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:10%
But today, I think
this is what we

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.960 align:middle line:10%
call a stargate or a wormhole.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I began to put these pieces
together and recognizing

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that if we're going to
ascend through a stargate

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
or a wormhole,
that we first must

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
put on this cloak
or garment of light.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:10%
And so I spent the time
from the early 2000s,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:10%
just pulling on
this golden thread

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:10%
or string of this
garment, if you will,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:10%
following the story of
Elijah reincarnating

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:10%
as John the Baptist, and seeing
how he reclaimed this garment

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:10%
and was able to
utilize its power

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:10%
and potential for
his own well-being,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:10%
and then ultimately how
he transmitted this cloak

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:10%
or garment of light to his
cousin Jesus at the baptism,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:10%
enabling Jesus then to
fulfill his earthly mission.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.971 align:middle line:84%
And I was just astounded by
the potential and possibility

00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered,
how come this isn't

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:90%
the basic Christian teaching?

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't it a popular
teaching in Christianity?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't the church
set up to assist us

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
in manifesting this incredibly
powerful garment of light?

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued pulling
on this golden thread,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I realized that ultimately,
this garment of light

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
was one of the key symbols
of the esoteric version

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And I began seeking
artwork that reflected

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
the utilization or-- not
just the acquisition,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
but utilization of
this garment of light.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:10%
Here we're looking at Antonio
Campi's beautiful painting

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.580 align:middle line:10%
in the Louvre, "The Mysteries
of the Passion of Christ."

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:10%
In the center of
the painting, we

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:10%
see a fairly traditional
image of the crucifixion:

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:10%
Jesus with the two
thieves on either side,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:10%
Mary Magdalene, the
mother Mary, is present.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And then as we pan
around the painting,

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
we start to see the
mystical version

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:84%
of the story or the mystical
attributes of this story

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%
emerge.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
We see the
resurrection of Jesus.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He is lit up like
a lightning bug.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He's actually resurrecting
from the tomb.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
He's manifested his glory
body or resurrection body

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:90%
as Christianity refers to it.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And then 40 days
after the resurrection

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of his attainment
of this light body,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
we are introduced then to
the idea of the ascension.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens in the
upper right of the painting,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
where now we see Jesus, having
attained his light body,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
is seen above this
spiraling or corkscrewing

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
mountain with angels
on either side of it.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
And he's ascending into this
apparent whirlwind or vortex.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And we see a trail of righteous
souls following along with him.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:10%
And we recognize that
in this ascension,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is no longer in
his flesh and blood form.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:10%
He's in a body of
light, and he is now

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:10%
ascending into the heavens.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:10%
Now Antonio Campi does
some extraordinary things

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:10%
in this painting.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:10%
And in the detail, we
see Jesus ascending

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:10%
with all the other righteous
souls that are following him

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:10%
along this path of
souls into the cosmos.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.590 align:middle line:10%
These are the
successful souls who

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:10%
have followed this
path or teaching

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:10%
and attained the vibration
of the body of light

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:10%
and are now capable of following
Jesus through this gateway.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And I documented this in my
book, The Secret of Sion:

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus's Stargate,
the Beaming Garment,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Galactic Core
in Ascension Art.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And this was a huge
inspiration for me,

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
this recognition that
the garment of light

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation of
esoteric Christian teaching.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:90%
It is arcanum.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I began
collecting as many images

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
as I could of Jesus
manifesting this body of light.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not typical, because
the typical crucifixion scene

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:84%
shows a bloodied
and tortured Jesus.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
He's supposed to be
here to suffer for us.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
He died for our sins
in order to save us

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
in traditional
Christian teaching.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But in the esoteric side,
he came here, rather,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to show us the way for us to
attain our own light body.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And the key fact that I realized
that a lot of these artists

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.540 align:middle line:84%
operated from--
their premise was

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that by tuning in
to images of Jesus

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the light body,
we feed our own light body.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:90%
So here.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Look at this
crucifixion scene where

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is manifesting this
rainbow colored light that's

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
exploding from within his
body, demonstrating the way

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to attain the rainbow body of
light or the resurrection body,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:90%
as it's called.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.125 align:middle line:84%
See the spray of
energy all around him

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and how those
closest to him were

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
able to absorb that
frequency or that vibration.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:10%
And it is us, of course,
who are close to Jesus

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:10%
as he's manifesting this
glory body at this moment.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:10%
Another favorite example is
the "Eisenheim Altarpiece"

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:10%
by Matthias Grunewald, where
we see Jesus resurrecting

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:10%
from the grave as this
brilliant light being,

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:10%
manifesting a light
as bright as the sun.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And we see him with this
rainbow colored aura of energy

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
all around his light body.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
To me, these are
far more inspiring,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and indeed instructive from
the soul's perspective,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
than seeing the traditional
bloodied and tortured Jesus.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me a sense that
I was on the right path

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
here to keep following
this direction here.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Follow the light body Jesus
rather than the suffering

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was the message that
I found in these paintings.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Soon it became
around the year 2006,

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and I had a very
fortunate meeting.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
You might call it a
synchronistic meeting.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference
in California,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and a lovely couple came up and
introduced themselves to me.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They were both in their
mid 50s, and they told me

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
they both had PhDs from the
Harvard Divinity School.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
They lived in India.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
They worked with the Dalai
Lama, translating Tibetan texts.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Their specialty, they said,
was the rainbow body of light,

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and they wondered if I'd
ever heard of it before.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:10%
And they gave me a
brief explanation

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:10%
of the rainbow body, which I'd
like to share with you now.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:10%
Essentially, this
practice is called

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:10%
Dzogchen or the great
perfection or mystic rapture.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.430 align:middle line:10%
And what the Tibetans teach
is that a teacher or yogi who

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:10%
has acquired the highest
forms of accomplishment

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:10%
can transform the subtle
aspects of the human body

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:10%
into pure light or what
is called the rainbow body

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:10%
or body of light.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The idea is is that
we can accelerate

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the human
body and spin it into a vortex,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.485 align:middle line:84%
dissolving the body into light,
leaving behind only hair, toe,

00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and fingernails, which have
no nerves to be transmuted.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And as this couple
is telling me this,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
my imagination's
just going wild.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking this is incredible,
to think that the human body is

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:84%
designed to be spun into
this vortex of multicolored

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:84%
or rainbow colored light that
can then travel the cosmos.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And this couple was
very deeply enthusiastic

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:90%
about sharing this with me.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why, they said, is

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're experts
in the rainbow body.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
They work with the
Tibetans, and they told me

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that my work actually
answered for them

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
a question that
the Tibetans never

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
would answer for them, either
because the answer was secret,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
they said, or because
perhaps the Tibetans didn't

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:90%
know the answer to the question.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
But my work in Egypt answered
this question for them,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The question was, once these
Lamas have perfected their body

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and manifested the
rainbow body of light,

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans teach
that then they

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
are able to travel to any of
the other 12 star systems--

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
13 star systems,
including our own--

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
where this resurrection
or rainbow body

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.120 align:middle line:90%
teaching is taught.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And what they always wondered
was how do they get there?

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words, how do they
get from Sol, our star system,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to Sirius or the Pleiades
or Orion or Arcturus or any

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.070 align:middle line:84%
of the other number
of star systems

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that are repeatedly
mentioned in myth

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and sacred tradition
the world over?

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.609 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we can get there
from here, how do we get there?

00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they said
they were watching

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
my presentation, my DVD
presentation "Star Walkers

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Dimension
of the Blessed"

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
about the ancient
Egyptian star walkers,

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:90%
and they got their answers.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
What I had proposed is that, in
the ancient Egyptian tradition,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Osiris acquired in
his resurrection

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%
a garment of light.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I had observed is
that when Osiris acquires

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
his garment of light,
he's very often

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
shown on the arc of the millions
of years, which to me looks

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
exactly like the way modern
science portrays a wormhole.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I started down
this path of comparing

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptian
star gods who

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:84%
we're assured are
transformed humans

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
who became celestial
beings, that

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:84%
being the entire premise of
the ancient Egyptian religion,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:84%
that a human can become a star
being or a celestial being

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
and travel the stars.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
As for example, as we see
here, the resurrected Osiris

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
is now called Orion.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And he sails aboard his
wormhole shaped ship

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
of eternity or arc of
the millions of years

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.547 align:middle line:84%
towards the field
of the blessed,

00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
via-- accessed via
the star fields

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, which is the
place the Egyptians were

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:90%
trying to aim their souls to.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the couple said their
eyes are just big as saucers

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
as they're watching
this because they're

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
going back and connecting the
dots with the Tibetans, who

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:84%
said that they can travel
to other star systems.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:90%
How do they do it?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Via a wormhole,
this couple said.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
My work answered that
question of how, once they

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
manifest the rainbow
body of light,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:90%
they can travel the stars.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Something else
that inspired them

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
was my imagery I provided
in another presentation

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.130 align:middle line:84%
where I documented my
experience on a cruise ship

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:90%
in Luxor, Egypt.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
We were invited to watch a
whirling Dervish dancer, very

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
special, 800-year-old
mystic Islamic dance.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
Dervish dancer comes out,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and he starts spinning in place.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
He's going into a meditative
trance as he's spinning.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And before I know it, he's
got this flying saucer

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.020 align:middle line:90%
around his body.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
He looked like Elijah
to me, going up

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
into that heavens in a whirlwind
in his merkaba vehicle.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm blown away by this
800-year-old mystic Islamic

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
dancer-- or dance
as he's performing

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
this incredible story
about human transformation.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And he's wielding this.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a sudden,
he pulls out a second skirt

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:10%
and starts spinning it.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:10%
And my jaw drops.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait a minute.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a wormhole.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
This mystic Islamic
dancers is showing us

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that our human body is
capable of being transformed

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
into a wormhole, which
is my entire premise

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
in my presentations
I had just been given

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
the day before to my
tour group in Egypt.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And here it is, right
before my very eyes.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So here's the comparison
between our Islamic dancer,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
our whirling Dervish or Sufi
dancer, beside a wormhole.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that 800 years
ago, somebody in Cairo, Egypt

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
imagined our body
dissolving into light

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
or transforming into a wormhole,
as we see happening here.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:10%
And what happened at
the end of the dance

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:10%
is that he collapses
his second skirt,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:10%
and he wraps it into a bundle.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:10%
And his assistant brings a
linen shroud out, if you will.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And they wrap the bundle,
and he feeds milk to it.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just blown away.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, OK, I
get the message here.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about how we
emerge on the earth plane

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
as a soul.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, we came through a
portal, our mother's womb

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:90%
in the birth canal.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But before that,
how did we get here?

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we came here
via a wormhole.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.901 align:middle line:84%
That's what this dance
seemed to suggest to me.

00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, after he
completed his dance,

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:90%
I went up to the dancer.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, I'm
just absolutely stunned

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.337 align:middle line:90%
by your performance.

00:18:40.337 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
What were you trying to
convey through that dance?

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:90%
What's the message?

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And through a translator,
he said, well,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I was explaining the
unity of heaven and earth.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow, why can't
I bring you back to Nashville

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.240 align:middle line:84%
with me or take you up
to Boston to MIT or over

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to Stanford where these high
energy physics types are trying

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:90%
to break the wormhole code?

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can show it
to us because it's

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
all within our body.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Our body is the stargate.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:10%
Our body is the wormhole.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.297 align:middle line:10%
And so after this meeting with
this couple at this conference,

00:19:12.297 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:10%
I went home, and I
started hitting the books

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:10%
and started hitting the
internet and saying,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:10%
OK, I gotta see what
I can figure out here.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.256 align:middle line:10%
I'm tremendously inspired.

00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this couple
started sending me

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:10%
PhD dissertations about
the rainbow body of light.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:10%
So some of what I'm going to
share with you in this episode

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:10%
today comes from
that research that I

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.346 align:middle line:10%
started doing as a
result of that couple.

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:10%
And I always like to
give them the most

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:10%
heartfelt thanks
for changing my life

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:10%
and tipping me off
to this reality here.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And one of the examples that
I found is this one here.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:10%
It's a thangka from
the 17th century where

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:10%
we see a Lama in the rainbow
body from the top down.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:10%
And look.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:10%
He looks exactly like our
mystic Islamic dancer performing

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:10%
the wormhole dance,
as I call it.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
He's spinning in place with
the same multi-colored imagery

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and the same spinning motion.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Now look what we see
here in the detail.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Look what's all over
this Lama's body.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing less than
the Chintamani symbol

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have referenced
over and over again

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in the "Arcanum"
series, the symbol

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:84%
for the wish-fulfilling jewel,
which I believe ultimately

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
the Chintamani is the symbol for
the attainment of the rainbow

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:90%
body of light.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultimate
wish we all have,

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.440 align:middle line:84%
is to manifest our rainbow
body of light, our glory body,

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
our resurrection
body, whatever term

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:84%
we feel most
comfortable for using.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's all telling the
same story, and it's not

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:84%
just the Tibetans
or the Egyptians

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
or the mystic Islamics that
have this story encoded

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
within their traditions.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It's actually all
over the world.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially a universal
or global teaching.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as noted, it
doesn't even come from Earth.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's taught in 13 star
systems, including our own.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm pondering that
and meditating on this,

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, wow, there must
be beings coming and going

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
through these star
gates and wormholes

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:90%
from all of these star systems.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact all of
us have the ability

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to manifest this rainbow
body of light and travel

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.000 align:middle line:84%
to these other star
systems and beyond.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's a really good example
of the rainbow body of light.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
This is Padmasambhava.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.080 align:middle line:84%
In the eighth century, he
came from India to Tibet

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
to teach the rainbow
body of light.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I love this imagery here
because we see the swirling

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
energy around him
that symbolizes

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow body of light.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:90%
But look at it through my eyes.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
What do we see on the
outer rim of his body

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:90%
but a portal or a gateway?

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And it made me feel like
I was on the right track

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
here in uniting the
rainbow body of light

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
with the star gate
or the wormhole.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:84%
They gate to heaven that we are
all seeking is our body itself.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Our body was designed
by whomever-- Ptah

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt or whatever
god being or deity we refer to.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's hard wired to be
spun into this vortex

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately manifest
the rainbow body of light.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
As I pulled on this
thread, I began

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
connecting up the
Tibetan tradition

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Christian tradition
and especially linking

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
with the Egyptian tradition.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:84%
This couple I referenced were
very kind in that about a month

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
after we met, I was
speaking in Tempe, Arizona,

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.245 align:middle line:84%
and I had been in
contact with them,

00:22:39.245 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned that I was
going to be talking about some

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:84%
of my new findings concerning
the rainbow body that

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:90%
were inspired by our meeting.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
it, but the couple

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
came to my presentation from
their home in California.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:10%
And I put up these
images of Osiris,

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:10%
where he's wearing what the
English mythologist and poet

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:10%
Gerald Massey referred to as
the crossed garment, his garment

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:10%
of light that was
crafted by Ptah,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian god of
smithcraft and alchemy

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:10%
who the Egyptians said
fashioned the human body.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:10%
And what I did is I put
Osiris next to the rainbow

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:10%
body of light thangka.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.820 align:middle line:10%
And the couple burst out
laughing because they never

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:10%
thought about that before.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:10%
But look at the
correspondence here.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:10%
It's a virtual perfect
match between the energy

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:10%
field on Osiris's
Atef crown and that

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:10%
that we see in the Tibetan
thangka of the rainbow body.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:10%
It makes perfect common
sense that the-- pardon me.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.430 align:middle line:10%
That the resurrection
body of Osiris

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:10%
and the rainbow body of
the Tibetan tradition

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:10%
are the same thing because
these cultures are surely all

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:10%
being influenced or
receiving teachings

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.720 align:middle line:10%
from these celestial beings who
brought this teaching to Earth.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:10%
So look at the swirling
energy of Osiris's crown.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:10%
His face is painted green,
symbolic of rebirth, renewal,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:10%
regeneration, resurrection.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:10%
We see the swirling energy
manifesting from the heart

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.260 align:middle line:10%
chakra of the Lama here, and we
have a perfect correspondence

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:10%
between these traditions.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:10%
Here's an image
here from the tomb

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:10%
of Nefertari in the
Valley of the Queens

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:10%
where Osiris is wearing
his crossed garment,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:10%
the bright white
garment of light.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:10%
He's got the swirling energy
around his neck and also

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:10%
the Atef crown.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting on his
feathered throne.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now when you see feathers
on a throne like this,

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
it indicates ascension.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:10%
And so what this
means is that Osiris

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:10%
is in fact in his ascension
or resurrection body.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it's what
the Tibetans referred

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:10%
to as the rainbow body of light.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:10%
It's all the same thing.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And by weaving my thread
through these traditions,

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to put
together a more, perhaps,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive body of work
about the rainbow body

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:84%
than you'll find in Christianity
or the Tibetan tradition

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:90%
or the ancient Egyptian.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe we have to unite
all these traditions in order

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.370 align:middle line:84%
to piece together
the entire picture.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
There's of course a
highly energetic component

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to Osiris's acquisition
of his garment of light.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
We have over here
Isis and Horus,

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
who are beaming energy to Osiris
and helping him to resurrect.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, it
triggers us to think

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.700 align:middle line:84%
that the rainbow
body of light is

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:84%
in fact an energy field produced
by the body, specifically

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
manifesting from
the heart chakra.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And it may well be
that the divine spark

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that the Gnostics referred
to is located in the heart,

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
and it is the source of the
manifestation of the rainbow

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And as usual, we see the
outer ring, which in my view

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:10%
indicates the opening of
the portal or the gateway.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Here's a key.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a message we've heard
in numerous "Arcanum" episodes.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:10%
Many Tibetans believe that just
seeing these revered images

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:10%
opens the mind to
hidden potentials.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So just by contemplating,
meditating, and reflecting

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:84%
on these images, we are able
to absorb the light or energy

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body and
awaken it from within us.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I encourage
people to do

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
is to get images such
as these thangkas

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
here and download them from the
internet and from my website.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I have mine on my cell phone.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
about 30 times a day,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm linking with my
rainbow body of light.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm imprinting the energy
of my divine body, my glory

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
body, my resurrection
body, into my energy field

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and remembering this
is where I want to go.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
actually within me.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
I go out and get.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It's something I reveal
from within myself.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:84%
He or this Lama is wearing the
rainbow body on the outside.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.870 align:middle line:90%
We wear it on the inside.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
We have these cloaks of
skin that conceal or occult

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
our true selves, our
rainbow bodies of light.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The essence of the great
perfection teaching

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is the direct
transmission of knowledge

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:90%
from master to disciple.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Dzogchen teaching is epitomized
in three principles known

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
as the three statements
of Garab Dorje, who

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
is the originator of the
rainbow body teaching in Tibet.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:84%
These three principles
are: direct introduction

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to one's own true nature;
two, not remaining in doubt

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:84%
concerning this
state; and three,

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.555 align:middle line:84%
continuing to remain
in this state.

00:27:56.555 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
what they're telling

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:84%
us here is that attaining the
rainbow body or manifesting,

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.300 align:middle line:84%
revealing it is a simple
three step process.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.055 align:middle line:84%
What I had done is just whittled
it down into my own vernacular.

00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we have to
imagine the rainbow body.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I hope
to accomplish in my work,

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.405 align:middle line:84%
is to help you to imagine
this, to recognize

00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that this is within you and to
bring it into your imagination

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and flood your imagination
with these images.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Next, you have to
believe it, and you

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.905 align:middle line:84%
have to continue to believe
that this is where you're going,

00:28:31.905 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:90%
that this is your destiny.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you have to live
your life with the expectation

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.340 align:middle line:90%
that this is your destiny.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the Tibetans teach
that, likely, all of us

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440 align:middle line:90%
have been reincarnating.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've been spending
lifetime after lifetime

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
accumulating knowledge,
wisdom, and the vibration

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body
of light and that all

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of that acquisition of knowledge
and wisdom and vibrations

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:90%
is cumulative.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they teach, we
can achieve the rainbow body

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
of light in one lifetime.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetan
sources that I've read

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that you
probably couldn't even

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
imagine that some of
the people you pass

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
on the street in the grocery
store are capable of doing this

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:90%
and don't even know it.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
They might even be this close
to finally dissolving their body

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.559 align:middle line:84%
into light, leaving behind only
hair, toe, and fingernails.

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine the next time
you're in the grocery store,

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.840 align:middle line:90%
something like that happens.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.005 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:29:30.005 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's what our
body is designed to do.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This is what this
existence is said

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to be all about, that
once we have fulfilled

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:84%
our earthly destiny, this
is how we get off this rock.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
Tibetans teach this

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
is the only way we will be
able to leave the arth plane.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:10%
So what I continued
to do is to say, OK,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.810 align:middle line:10%
what if the resurrection body
of Osiris, the crossed body,

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:10%
is the same body of light,
the resurrection body attained

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.910 align:middle line:10%
by Jesus?

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we know he was in Egypt.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:90%
He grew up there.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So what if he was at
Abydos or Dendera or some

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:84%
of these other temple
locations where

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
we see emphatic and very
direct references to Osiris

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:90%
attaining the resurrection body?

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
What if this is what
we're talking about here?

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And remember, Jesus spent
those 18 missing years

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
between 12 and 30 in India,
in Tibet, in Mongolia.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.640 align:middle line:90%
What was he doing there?

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my scenario,
he was learning

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.595 align:middle line:84%
to attain the
rainbow body of light

00:30:35.595 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
to show us the way in order to
manifest our highest potential.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:10%
And so I absolutely equate
the resurrection or glory

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.360 align:middle line:10%
body of Christ with
the rainbow body.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:10%
And when we see
images such as this,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.432 align:middle line:10%
"Christ and Mary in
the Cloud," you know,

00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:10%
you see some people that want
to argue or try to convince you

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.150 align:middle line:10%
that this is like
a flying saucer.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.600 align:middle line:10%
But come on.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:84%
When you hit the books, and you
recognize what this really is,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.340 align:middle line:84%
now we know that this is
in fact Jesus and Mary

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:90%
riding upon a luminous cloud.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And they do look
like flying saucers.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:84%
But trust me, they're
not flying Toyotas

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:84%
or tricked out Benzes
that can travel the stars.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:84%
These are organic
light vehicles.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
These are-- these
luminous clouds

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:28.350 align:middle line:84%
that Christ and Mary ride in--
is the rainbow body of light

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to
travel interdimensionally.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.300 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans teach that once
you attain the rainbow body,

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you can phase back and
forth between physicality,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.040 align:middle line:90%
between flesh and light.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.700 align:middle line:84%
How many times did Jesus do
that after the resurrection?

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Numerous times.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:90%
He ate with the disciples.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:90%
He walked with the disciples.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.180 align:middle line:84%
They thought he was a real
flesh and blood being.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, he probably was because
having attained the rainbow

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.340 align:middle line:84%
body, he can phase
back and forth.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.790 align:middle line:84%
He had attained the crossed
body, the resurrection

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
body of Osiris, the
rainbow body of light

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
superhuman capabilities,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.240 align:middle line:84%
including the ability
to open stargates

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and wormholes via
his light body.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
This is what it's all about in
the arcanum or mystery school

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Now as we go forward, let's
look at a couple of statements

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.130 align:middle line:84%
here that dramatically
and emphatically tell us

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus in fact had
attained the rainbow

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:37.276 align:middle line:84%
body of light or the
great perfection.

00:32:37.276 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's a statement from
the Gospel of Philip, which

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
was a Gnostic
encyclopedia, fortunately,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:84%
was rediscovered
in the Nag Hammadi

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:90%
cache of documents in 1945.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.020 align:middle line:10%
Philip says, "The lord
rose from the dead.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:10%
He became as he was, but
now his body was perfect."

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.700 align:middle line:10%
It's a direct correlation to the
great perfection of the rainbow

00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.520 align:middle line:10%
body.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:10%
"He possessed flesh,
but this was true flesh.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh isn't true.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:10%
Ours is only an
image of the true."

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.190 align:middle line:10%
Oh, that statement
is just loaded

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.020 align:middle line:10%
with meaning in a holographic
reality or a virtual reality.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:90%
This isn't our real body.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
This is only an image
of our true body.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Our true body is the perfect
body, the rainbow body

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:90%
of light, the resurrection body.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we attain
it, we are free souls.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%
We're successful souls.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:84%
We're perfected beings
who have the ability

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.460 align:middle line:84%
to phase back and forth
between the dimensions.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Why would you want to phase
back into physicality?

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Tibetan great
perfection teaching

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:84%
tells us you would do
that because you're

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:84%
a being of complete
compassion and love,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and you would love nothing
more than the opportunity

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
to come back into
the earth plane

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to awaken others to the
reality of who they truly are

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and to transform this
planet from a place of fear

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:90%
to a place of light and love.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at
the comparison here

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Lama and the rainbow
body and Jesus on the rainbow.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They tell exactly
the same story.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
the manifestation

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow body of light.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:10%
And this is why Jesus is on the
rainbow throne in last judgment

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.409 align:middle line:10%
and second coming in
resurrection Christian imagery.

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:10%
This is what it means.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:10%
In Hans Memling's "Saint
John the Evangelist

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:10%
on Patmos," which is what
we're looking at here,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:10%
we see John the
Revelator in the midst

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.880 align:middle line:10%
of his visionary
experience that put him

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.909 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of the
resurrected Christ.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:10%
Over the rainbow bridge
is the glorified Jesus

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:10%
on his rainbow throne.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:10%
John gives an explicit and
dramatic eyewitness account

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:10%
of seeing the resurrected
Christ in his rainbow body.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:90%
This is what he's describing.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And he's in fact inviting us to
attain the same level of light

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:90%
and love, of purity.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Now I hear this all
the time, that humans

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:90%
can't attain perfection.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:90%
How dare you?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You know, nobody's perfect.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what our culture teaches.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, that's what the
dark side wants you to believe.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:28.090 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is
we are already perfect.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:31.460 align:middle line:84%
We just have to chisel
away the imperfection.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.260 align:middle line:84%
You might have heard that
story about Michelangelo

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:90%
approaching the stone.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And the apprentice asks
him, "Master, how are you

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:44.090 align:middle line:84%
going to bring out the wonderful
sculpture within that stone?"

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps a horse, for example.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And the sculptor, Michelangelo,
says, well, all I'm going to do

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:84%
is just look at
the stone, and I'm

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
going to take away
everything from it that

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.050 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to do with a horse.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:84%
That's how we attain the
rainbow body of light.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We look at our life, and we
take away everything about it

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have to do with
the rainbow body of light.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're left with.

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:84%
It's about removing,
not attaining.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:10%
It's about unveiling
our true self.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And that's the message of
the rainbow body of light.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.810 align:middle line:10%
So as we're going forward,
just allow the energy

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:10%
of these thangkas--
these beautiful thangkas

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:10%
which I was privileged
to stand before

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and allowed to photograph
for your benefit--

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.670 align:middle line:10%
to just radiate you, if you
will, to beam into your energy

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:10%
field, to come into
your energy field

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.550 align:middle line:10%
and to begin to peel away the
layers, to peel away the stone,

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:10%
the hardness and get
into that core, that

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:10%
divine spark that's within you,
and release this most sacred,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:10%
holy, and indeed perfect
aspect of who you truly are.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And as we go here, you can-- you
know, just common sense tells

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.230 align:middle line:84%
us that we're looking at
exactly the same experience,

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.880 align:middle line:84%
whether in the rainbow body or
the resurrection body of Jesus.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same story.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And the key here is
is that just seeing

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
these images awakens
this potential within us.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that beautiful?

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.050 align:middle line:10%
What a marvelous system to
awaken our true potential.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's really
no books about it.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in the Dalai Lama's
secret temple behind the Potala

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.210 align:middle line:10%
Palace is a room, a
temple, 360 degrees.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:84%
This is where the Dalai Lamas
would go for hundreds of years

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to learn about the
rainbow body of light.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.858 align:middle line:84%
There's not a single
book in there.

00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:90%
There's not a single word.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all images.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It's all paintings that
guide us through this process

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.660 align:middle line:90%
of manifesting the rainbow body.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite images of
Christ in the rainbow body

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:10%
is by William Holman Hunt.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.240 align:middle line:10%
And we see Jesus and the
360 degree rainbow ring.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:10%
We've got Mary Magdalene there.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's beaming
this ultimate energy

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.400 align:middle line:84%
into the world for
all of us to absorb.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Talk about going over the
rainbow or into the rainbow.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.010 align:middle line:10%
This is a magnificent
example of this.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:10%
You know, this
shouldn't sound too far

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.580 align:middle line:10%
out for traditional
Christians because this

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.050 align:middle line:10%
is the hope and promise
of Christianity.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Christians believe
that in the end times,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.400 align:middle line:10%
the entire human body of
Christ and only Christians

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.024 align:middle line:10%
will be changed to light to
match the body of Christ.

00:38:40.024 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:10%
And they believe this
is going to happen

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.860 align:middle line:10%
in the blink of an eye.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:10%
They call this rapture.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.070 align:middle line:10%
Mystic rapture is a
better term, perhaps.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Paul writes in Corinthians,
"But we all, with unveiled face,

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.995 align:middle line:10%
beholding as in
a mirror (LOUDLY)

00:38:55.995 --> 00:38:57.331 align:middle line:10%
the glory of the Lord."

00:38:57.331 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:10%
Sorry.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:10%
That's the televangelist
in me coming out.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:10%
But really, the word glory
simply means to glow rays.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.050 align:middle line:10%
So Paul is saying,
beholding as in a mirror,

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.690 align:middle line:10%
the glowing rays of the
Lord are being transformed

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:10%
into the same image from
glory to glory, just

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.430 align:middle line:10%
as by the spirit of the Lord.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Now reading this
literally, it's saying

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.860 align:middle line:84%
that we are going
to mirror or match

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Christ's frequency in
his resurrection body.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.980 align:middle line:84%
That means rapture is
all about attaining,

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in the blink of an eye,
the rainbow body of light.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Christians believe you
don't have to do anything

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to attain that except proclaim
Jesus Christ as your lord

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and savior, and that's fine.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely encourage that.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But in my view, why not
take it a step further

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:90%
and assist the process?

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:10%
Why not commit to unveiling
this and mirroring that light

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.340 align:middle line:10%
and love in your daily
life and your actions

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:10%
and recognizing that
that's also a valid way

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:08.240 align:middle line:10%
to assist in this process?

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite images also
of Jesus and his resurrection

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:10%
or rainbow body is "Christ
in the Realm of the Dead"

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.070 align:middle line:10%
by Joakim Skovgaard,
a Russian artist.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:10%
And what we see here
is Mary Magdalene

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:10%
receiving the vibration of the
resurrection or rainbow body

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.940 align:middle line:10%
from Christ on Easter morning.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
We know she's received
it because she's

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.870 align:middle line:84%
got the rainbow halo
around her head.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And here's Jesus
opening the heart chakra

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and beaming to the Magdalene
this frequency or vibration

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.650 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow body.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And now she, who is
his chief apostle,

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
can then go out into the
world and share that frequency

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or vibration, not only
with the other disciples,

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:84%
but with all who
care to receive it.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Powerful, powerful,
powerful image.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
This light body or star
body, as we can refer to it,

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
is our hidden inner
spiritual body

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that's referenced in numerous
spiritual traditions.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:90%
John write-- excuse me.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.580 align:middle line:84%
John White wrote an article
in "Enlightenment Magazine,"

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:90%
where he cataloged these for us.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:10%
In Sufism, it's called
the most sacred body

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.030 align:middle line:10%
and supracelestial body.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And as I read these
off, they give you

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:10%
not only the attributes of
the rainbow body of light,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.400 align:middle line:10%
but also suggest the
substance of which it's made

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:10%
and how to attain it as well.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:10%
So it's called the
supracelestial body.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:10%
Taoists call it
the diamond body.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.962 align:middle line:10%
We talked about that in
the Botticelli episode.

00:41:42.962 --> 00:41:44.670 align:middle line:10%
And those who have
attained it are called

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:10%
the immortals and
the cloud walkers

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:10%
because the rainbow body of
light is misty and cloud-like,

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:10%
and these beings
appeared to walk

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:10%
on clouds, clouds of light.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.650 align:middle line:10%
Yogic schools and Tantrics
call it the divine body.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:10%
In Kriya yoga, it's
called the body of bliss.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:10%
In Vedanta, it's called
the super conductive body.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.650 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptians
called it the luminous body

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.460 align:middle line:10%
of being or akh or the karast.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.060 align:middle line:10%
This conception evolved
into Gnosticism,

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:10%
where it's called
the radiant body.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:10%
Again, a very
descriptive attribute.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.141 align:middle line:84%
In the Mithraic liturgy,
it's called the perfect body.

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And the perfect
body isn't something

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
you can get by
throwing 50 grand down

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:90%
at your local plastic surgeon.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The perfect body
comes from within.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the rainbow body of
light that transforms us.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher Sri Aurobindo
called it the divine body

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and said it is composed
of supramental substance.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:90%
That's an incredible statement.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.500 align:middle line:84%
The 20th century Christian
mystic Teilhard de Chardin

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.280 align:middle line:90%
called it the ultrahuman.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the next human.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:84%
In the Hermetic
Corpus Hermeticum,

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:90%
it's called the immortal body.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the alchemical
tradition, in arcanum,

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.710 align:middle line:90%
it's called the golden body.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.620 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.570 align:middle line:84%
These are descriptive terms
for this body of light,

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.830 align:middle line:84%
showing it in all these
various traditions.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I like to collect examples not
only of the masculine images

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body, but also
the divine feminine as well.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
White Tara enfolded

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:84%
within the rainbow ring,
which is considered

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.350 align:middle line:84%
to be a bridge
between dimensions.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:84%
We also have another
example of the White Tara.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Notice the rainbow ring around
her inner body as well as

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.260 align:middle line:90%
her outer body.

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we have another example
here of Jesus on the rainbow

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.180 align:middle line:84%
ring, perfectly
correspondent, where

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:84%
he's enthroned on the
360 degree rainbow ring.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:84%
We're all down here in
the chaos of earth life,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and all the good
stuff we want is

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.340 align:middle line:84%
said to be up here around
the throne of Christ.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.830 align:middle line:90%
How do we get here?

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:84%
By manifesting our resurrection
body or rainbow body of light.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Continuing on, we see other
examples of the rainbow body.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the White
Tara again, an image

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I took in the LA
County Museum of Art.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I was entranced by this
image of the White Tara

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.210 align:middle line:84%
in an apparent portal or
gateway, at least to my eyes.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was only later, when
I'm more intently studying

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the image, that I noticed
that not only does she

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
have the third eye open, but
that when you look at her legs,

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.990 align:middle line:84%
they're rainbows, indicating
a subtle way of portraying

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.130 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow body of light.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.260 align:middle line:90%
So here's how they portray it.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the ideas is that as
we contemplate and meditate

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and reflect on these images, we
bring it into our energy field.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.570 align:middle line:10%
Jan van Eyck shows
the resurrected Jesus

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:10%
in the rainbow body, very
powerful example to me,

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.270 align:middle line:10%
where he's just staring
us right into our eyes,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:10%
right into our soul, and
saying, manifest this rainbow

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:10%
body of light, this
body of light and love.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct correspondence
between these images.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere between the
Tibetan rainbow body tradition

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Christian idea
of the resurrection body

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.520 align:middle line:84%
is where we find the meeting
ground between all the world's

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.690 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
which avenue you choose.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.870 align:middle line:10%
They're all going to
lead to the same place.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.010 align:middle line:10%
I was in the George Washington
Freemasonic Memorial

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.180 align:middle line:10%
in Washington, DC in the
Knights Templar Chapel,

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.460 align:middle line:10%
and I took this photo
of this, of Jesus

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.009 align:middle line:10%
manifesting the
resurrection body.

00:45:34.009 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:10%
Look at the rainbow
light around him.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Look at the white
light around him.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.460 align:middle line:10%
This is the combination of the
bright white garment of light,

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:10%
which is all the colors of
the rainbow swirled into one.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:10%
And we have them combined here.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.750 align:middle line:10%
I love this stained glass window
because he looks like Rocky

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:50.420 align:middle line:10%
to me.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.940 align:middle line:10%
He looks like he's
attained victory,

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.270 align:middle line:10%
and he's encouraging us
also to attain victory,

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.660 align:middle line:10%
to dig deep within
ourselves and manifest

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.590 align:middle line:10%
this rainbow body of light.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:06.230 align:middle line:10%
So both of these images are
telling exactly the same story.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus's statement
on perfection, by the way.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.320 align:middle line:10%
If you want a direct Christian
teaching on perfection,

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.350 align:middle line:10%
here it is.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:19.460 align:middle line:10%
In an episode, Jesus utters
this statement of truth.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:10%
He says, "I tell you the truth.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.680 align:middle line:10%
It is hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:10%
Again I tell you, it's
easier for a camel

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.870 align:middle line:10%
to go through the
eye of a needle

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:10%
than for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of God."

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Now traditional Christian
teaching on this

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:84%
would have you understand
that Jesus is referring

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to a literal camel having
to get on its knees,

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.310 align:middle line:84%
to have its cargo taken
off its back in order

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to enter the gateway to
the Temple of Solomon.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But the esoteric
version, at least

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.280 align:middle line:84%
my interpretation of this,
is a little bit different.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.237 align:middle line:84%
I believe that what
Jesus is saying is

00:46:57.237 --> 00:46:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is that if we want to get
through the eye of the needle,

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:84%
the eye of the wormhole,
we've got to drop this body.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:84%
This cargo body is
not going anywhere.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of heaven,

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.054 align:middle line:84%
which means we've got
to drop this body.

00:47:13.054 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And as the Tibetans
say, we've got

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve it
into light in order

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:90%
to go through the wormhole.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in the
episode-- and by the way,

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.470 align:middle line:84%
this is a painting
by Salvador Dali.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I took this photo in
the National Gallery

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.860 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And I love it because as
you look at Jesus closely,

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:33.820 align:middle line:84%
he's got this rainbow energy
pouring out of this body.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And Dali brilliantly
shows him phasing

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
between the material and
the immaterial realm.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:84%
He's neither fully here
in this material dimension

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.060 align:middle line:84%
nor is he fully in the
immaterial dimension.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:90%
He's in both places.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's intently, again,
inviting us to follow him

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:90%
through the eye of the needle.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in
this episode is key,

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:84%
is that Jesus uttered
this truth in response

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.640 align:middle line:90%
to a question from the rich man.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.686 align:middle line:84%
He had asked him what is
required for eternal life.

00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:10.810 align:middle line:84%
What is the secret of
eternal life, in other words?

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said, follow
the commandments.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And the commandments are,
"Love with all your heart,

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.260 align:middle line:84%
with all your soul,
and with all your mind.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the first and
greatest commandment,

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and the second is
like unto to it.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Love your neighbor as yourself.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:84%
All the law and
the prophets hang

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.430 align:middle line:90%
on these two commandments."

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:10%
That's the secret of
eternal life right there,

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.690 align:middle line:10%
and it's also the
secret to attaining

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow body of light.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:39.800 align:middle line:10%
How do we do it?

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:10%
We love with all our heart,
all our mind, all our soul

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.570 align:middle line:10%
and love our
neighbor as ourselves

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.100 align:middle line:10%
because we recognize our
neighbor is our self.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the rich man came
back to Jesus, and he said,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.094 align:middle line:90%
I've always done that.

00:48:54.094 --> 00:48:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I've always kept
the commandments.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.885 align:middle line:84%
I doubt that because he wouldn't
have asked that question

00:48:57.885 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:90%
to Jesus if he had, right?

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to know
what else is required.

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, how many shekels or
gold bars or whatever, perhaps?

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And here's the punchline.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.680 align:middle line:10%
Jesus then told him, "If
thou wilt be perfect,"

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:10%
meaning whole, holy, and
complete, go and sell

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.140 align:middle line:10%
what you've got, "give it
to the poor, and thou shalt

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:22.475 align:middle line:10%
have treasure in heaven;
and then come and follow me"

00:49:22.475 --> 00:49:23.350 align:middle line:10%
through the wormhole.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's my
statement anyway.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:10%
Now I'm not advocating
that you have

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.360 align:middle line:10%
to go sell everything
you've got.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:32.550 align:middle line:10%
But the message here is clear.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.890 align:middle line:10%
It's crystal clear.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:10%
Jesus is saying our
stuff isn't going with us

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.800 align:middle line:10%
through the eye of the
needle, through the wormhole.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.190 align:middle line:10%
We've got to let that stuff go.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.827 align:middle line:10%
We got to peel away the stone.

00:49:47.827 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:10%
We've got-- because the
stone isn't going through,

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.100 align:middle line:10%
but the horse can.

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.410 align:middle line:10%
And that's what he, I
believe, is telling us here.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:58.510 align:middle line:10%
We've got to peel away
the layers of materialism

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.470 align:middle line:10%
and all of the things
we devote our lives

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.850 align:middle line:10%
to that are wonderful
experiences,

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.620 align:middle line:10%
but devote ourselves to
getting through that gateway.

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this image here is one
that I absolutely love.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And as we're getting
towards our closing,

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share it
with you because it

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.440 align:middle line:84%
helps us to enlarge our
imagination in this way.

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We see Jesus as the vine, and
we see branches going off him.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.510 align:middle line:84%
He's holding a
cluster of grapes,

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and there are 12
disciples around him.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And I got to
thinking about this.

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember what the Tibetans
said, that the rainbow body

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:38.860 align:middle line:84%
teaching is taught in 13 star
systems, including our own?

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:43.840 align:middle line:84%
What if the 12 disciples
plus Jesus, the 13th,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.780 align:middle line:84%
represent the 13 star systems
where this resurrection

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.290 align:middle line:84%
or rainbow body of light
teaching is taught?

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What if it's about us unifying
with these star systems

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and becoming one with them
and loving our neighbors

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.230 align:middle line:84%
in these other star
systems as ourselves?

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Could that be the
ultimate message

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body
of light teaching,

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that we are in fact part of
a federation, if you will,

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.285 align:middle line:84%
of star systems where
these teachings are taught?

00:51:14.285 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:84%
What if Earth is
in fact an island

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:20.350 align:middle line:84%
or a colony in this
federation-- to use a Star Trek

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:24.190 align:middle line:84%
term-- of star systems where
this teaching is taught?

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:84%
What if we're all in
the same ring together?

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a very provocative thought.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I'm going
to leave you with

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.530 align:middle line:90%
another provocative thought.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is is that the Shroud
of Turin, as we call it,

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:43.990 align:middle line:84%
is in fact a relic of Jesus'
attainment of the rainbow

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:84%
body of light,
that in fact he has

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.820 align:middle line:84%
left for us a scientifically
valid way of proving

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the attainment of the
rainbow body of light.

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.330 align:middle line:84%
In December, 2011, the Turin
Shroud, scientists announced,

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:03.590 align:middle line:84%
was created by a flash
of supernatural light.

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be a medieval
forgery, these scientists said.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Scientists from
Italy's National Agency

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:11.730 align:middle line:84%
for New Technologies, Energy,
and Sustainable Economic

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Development spent years trying
to replicate the shroud's

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920 align:middle line:90%
markings.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:10%
And they came to the
conclusion that it

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.210 align:middle line:10%
was a short and intense
burst of radiation or light

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:24.580 align:middle line:10%
that came from within
the body of the person

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:28.730 align:middle line:10%
in the shroud that
caused those markings.

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is direct
evidence that Jesus existed

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and actually attained
the rainbow body of light

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and that what we
are left with here

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is not a relic but actually
proof that humans can transform

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:84%
themselves into stars
or celestial beings.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
secret of arcanum.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:53:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And now Clare's going to take
us deeper into the rainbow

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.930 align:middle line:84%
body of light teaching
by connecting us

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
with the divine feminine and
the ancient goddesses who also

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:17.080 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated this
extraordinary human capability.

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The story
of the goddess

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Inanna's descent
into the underworld

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.720 align:middle line:90%
is the oldest human story.

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It is the prototype
story for all heroes

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:middle line:90%
in search of arcanum.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:35.700 align:middle line:84%
In the Sumerian poem of Inanna's
journey to her sister's throne,

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:39.220 align:middle line:84%
she travels to the
Kur, the underworld,

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.480 align:middle line:90%
through a series of seven gates.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.740 align:middle line:84%
At each gate, she
removes a power object,

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:48.000 align:middle line:84%
a symbol from her
body, until she

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.780 align:middle line:84%
stands naked before the throne
of her sister, Ereshkigal.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.840 align:middle line:84%
According to one
story, Inanna tricked

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.760 align:middle line:84%
her grandfather, the god
of alchemy and technology,

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.860 align:middle line:84%
known as Enki, into
giving her the Mes.

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:17.590 align:middle line:84%
The Mes were documents, tablet,
or stones which were blueprints

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to civilization and contained
the secrets of the gods.

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The poem says she gathered
together the seven Mes.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:30.150 align:middle line:84%
With the Mes in
her possession, she

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:34.740 align:middle line:84%
prepares herself to journey
into the afterlife by clothing

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and then disrobing herself
in several objects.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:43.310 align:middle line:84%
These objects are seen in a
statue of the goddess Mari

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:47.280 align:middle line:90%
from 2,300 BC.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.670 align:middle line:84%
On her head, she
wears the shugurra,

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:90%
the crown of the steppe.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Around her neck she wears
the small lapis beads.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Some say this necklace
was a rainbow.

00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Her body is wrapped
in the royal robe.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:08.310 align:middle line:84%
On her wrist, she wears the
gold ring, and in her hand,

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:14.180 align:middle line:84%
she carries the lapis,
measuring rod, and line.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Her robe is called pala
or miracle garment.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Water streams down
her robe, clothing

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the lower part of the body with
a rippling, translucent veil

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of water, imparting the
idea that she had either

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:33.500 align:middle line:84%
risen from the water or
lived in it like a mermaid.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.170 align:middle line:84%
William and I were in
the Louvre in Paris,

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:39.850 align:middle line:84%
where we took this photo
of Lady Taperet dressed

00:55:39.850 --> 00:55:42.850 align:middle line:84%
in an elegant pleated
gown and shown

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:48.010 align:middle line:84%
praying to the falcon headed
god, Re-Harakhti, crowned

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:54.090 align:middle line:84%
by a solar disk whose
beams are lotus flowers.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphs
arranged above Taperet

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
exalt the gods to accord
her all the offerings needed

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.490 align:middle line:84%
for her to survive
in the beyond.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:07.460 align:middle line:84%
We especially note the texture
of her transparent afterlife

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.410 align:middle line:90%
garment.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.600 align:middle line:84%
A side by side comparison
with the Tibetan rainbow body

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.020 align:middle line:90%
reveals her gown looks familiar.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.250 align:middle line:10%
This symbolism is repeated
on this stele, also

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.890 align:middle line:10%
from the Louvre.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:10%
The deceased woman
stands before Atum.

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:32.950 align:middle line:10%
Once again, she wears
the garment of light.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:36.120 align:middle line:10%
This symbolism is
repeated on this stele

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.770 align:middle line:10%
also from the Louvre.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.220 align:middle line:84%
This time, Thoth,
the god of arcanum,

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:84%
escorts the deceased woman
to the throne of Osiris.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is Inanna or
an Egyptian priestess,

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.990 align:middle line:84%
the idea of changing
robes is central

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.320 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife journey.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:84%
In Nashville, Tennessee, we
find this stunning 42 foot tall

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:03.130 align:middle line:84%
statue of the Greek
goddess of wisdom, Athena,

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:06.920 align:middle line:90%
completely covered in gold.

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.050 align:middle line:84%
She wears the aegis,
a large collar

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or cape worn in ancient times to
display the protection provided

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:17.240 align:middle line:90%
by a high religious authority.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.560 align:middle line:10%
"And among them went
bright-eyed Athena,

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.340 align:middle line:10%
holding the precious aegis,
which is ageless and immortal,"

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.800 align:middle line:10%
wrote Homer in The Iliad.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.860 align:middle line:84%
In 1482, the Medici
family commissioned

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Sandro Botticelli's painting,
"Pallas and the Centaur."

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:42.640 align:middle line:10%
This is Athena in all her glory.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.630 align:middle line:10%
Athena is wearing a light
down, white and transparent,

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:50.650 align:middle line:10%
decorated with
diamond tipped rings.

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:53.760 align:middle line:10%
She is wrapped in a
large green cloak.

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.280 align:middle line:10%
A mesh of olive shoots encircles
her shoulders, arms, breast,

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.100 align:middle line:10%
and thighs, forming a sort of
vegetable breast plate which

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.960 align:middle line:10%
makes her gown
cling to the body.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.870 align:middle line:10%
Her long, thick
blonde tresses are

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:12.560 align:middle line:10%
adorned with a wreath of
entwined olive branches

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.850 align:middle line:10%
with a diamond at the top
within a four-leafed setting.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:21.080 align:middle line:10%
The goddess of
virgins, Pallas Athena,

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.920 align:middle line:10%
was replaced by the Virgin Mary.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.395 align:middle line:10%
The cloak of light
symbolism continued.

00:58:26.395 --> 00:58:29.250 align:middle line:10%


00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:33.550 align:middle line:10%
She adopted Athena's
cloak and crown.

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Mary's crown of
stars may correspond

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:43.460 align:middle line:84%
with Inanna or Ishtar
or Mari's helmet.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.190 align:middle line:10%
In this painting by an
unknown 17th century painter,

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.420 align:middle line:10%
she wears the cloak of stars as
she saves souls in purgatory.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.180 align:middle line:10%
In Filippo Lippi's
"Annunciation,"

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.970 align:middle line:10%
Mary wears the star
cloak or light cloak,

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:05.565 align:middle line:10%
a plasma-like crown, and
a cloak of many colors.

00:59:05.565 --> 00:59:08.430 align:middle line:90%


00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.620 align:middle line:84%
This hints at the
rainbow body of light

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and suggests that Mary was more
than a literate peasant girl,

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.010 align:middle line:90%
as tradition says.

00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:25.220 align:middle line:84%
On October the 13th,
1917, in Fatima, Portugal,

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.860 align:middle line:84%
an event occurred that was
witnessed by 70,000 people

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and remains inexplicable
to this day.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.870 align:middle line:84%
After a violent
rainstorm, the clouds

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:42.010 align:middle line:84%
parted, revealing the sun as
a disc spinning in the sky

00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and radiating a
rainbow of colors,

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.304 align:middle line:84%
then falling to the
earth in a strange way.

00:59:49.304 --> 00:59:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Could this have been Mary in her
rainbow body or cloak of light?

00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.440 align:middle line:84%
After the mother
of Jesus, the robe

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.450 align:middle line:84%
passed to Mary
Magdalene, shown here

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:05.710 align:middle line:84%
receiving the cloak from
the alchemist Zosimus.

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:11.800 align:middle line:10%
Like Jesus, the Virgin Mary is
considered an ascended being

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.420 align:middle line:10%
who is capable of
phasing or appearing

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.670 align:middle line:10%
in our light spectrum.

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:23.440 align:middle line:10%
In Christian tradition,
Jesus manifested via a portal

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.990 align:middle line:10%
to take Mary to heaven,
called the assumption or door

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
mission of the virgin.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.140 align:middle line:84%
In this example by
an unknown artist,

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Jesus emerges from the portal.

01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:41.440 align:middle line:10%
Mary ascends in an
orb of blue light.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Mary appeared in the
18th century in Mexico.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.730 align:middle line:10%
This work by Juan de Villegas
shows the traditional icon

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.590 align:middle line:10%
of the vision of Our
Lady of Guadalupe

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:56.830 align:middle line:10%
stepping onto the half
moon, held by an angel,

01:00:56.830 --> 01:01:02.020 align:middle line:10%
crowned, and covered by a
starry cloak, and surrounded by

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
and aureal brilliant with light.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
In the corners of the
canvas, the four apparitions

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Virgin to the
Indian Juan Diego

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
are portrayed on Tepeyac
Mountain in accordance

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:19.020 align:middle line:90%
with tradition.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
In the two upper
corners, accompanied

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
by two angels, the
Indian witnesses

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
the divine apparition
that asks him

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:33.430 align:middle line:84%
to go to the bishop of Zumarraga
to tell him what he has seen.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
He also tells the
bishop to build

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.340 align:middle line:90%
a temple on that precise spot.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
The indifference of the
prelate and his desire

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to have more tangible proof than
the simple word of the Indian

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
causes a third
apparition, represented

01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
in the lower left corner with
its subsequent commandment

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of Juan Diego to
pick some roses,

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
hide them in his
blanket or cloak,

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.790 align:middle line:90%
and show them to Zumarraga.

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%


01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.870 align:middle line:10%
This leads to the fourth
and last apparition

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:10.490 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of the
bishop and his companions,

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.050 align:middle line:10%
who are able to
verify that it is not

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:17.630 align:middle line:10%
the flowers but the
sacred image of the virgin

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:21.560 align:middle line:10%
that appears on
Juan Diego's cloak.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.640 align:middle line:10%
In "The Eternal Father Painting
the Virgin of Guadalupe,"

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.990 align:middle line:10%
attributed to Johan Villegas, we
see God in his heavenly studio

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.300 align:middle line:10%
or workshop putting
final touches

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.120 align:middle line:10%
on a piece of coarse cloth
held by three angels.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
The cloth bears the image
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.710 align:middle line:10%
The fact that the first
account of the apparitions

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:52.370 align:middle line:10%
of the virgin gives no details
about how the image was

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:56.360 align:middle line:10%
imprinted on the
fiber cloth gave rise

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.990 align:middle line:10%
to debates regarding
the possibility

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:02.670 align:middle line:10%
that the paints used to
execute the said image

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
were created by
a heavenly being.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:11.400 align:middle line:10%
"The Miracle of the Little
Spring" by Rafael Planes

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.590 align:middle line:10%
allegorically
depicts the faithful,

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.540 align:middle line:10%
who are stirred by one
of the first miracles

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.340 align:middle line:10%
of the virgin of Guadalupe.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We see the gushing
forth of a stream

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
of curative waters
at the exact spot

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:29.575 align:middle line:84%
where the virgin made her
third appearance to Juan Diego.

01:03:29.575 --> 01:03:33.032 align:middle line:90%


01:03:33.032 --> 01:03:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching "Arcanum."

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CLARE: And I'm Clare Henry.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:39.390 align:middle line:90%
