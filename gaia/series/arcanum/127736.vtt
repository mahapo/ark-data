00:00:14.902 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Greek mythology is loaded
with insights about the soul,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.870 align:middle line:90%
ascension, and the light body.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
In particular, the story
of Prometheus and Athena

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
provides the basis for many of
today's ideas about ascension.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
For the ancient
Greeks, man was created

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
by Prometheus, who was
a member of the earliest

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.040 align:middle line:90%
race of giants called Titans.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
These were the mighty ones,
who were called Nephilim

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:84%
in the book of Genesis
and are believed to be

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.000 align:middle line:90%
responsible for the flood.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Some

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Believe the evidence shows these
beings are 9 to 12 feet tall.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And there is evidence
that these giants even

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
made their way to North
America, particularly

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
to West Virginia,
Ohio, and Tennessee.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
distinct possibility.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've done my own share
of chasing their secrets

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
in my backyard in Nashville.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:90%
I believe they are real beings.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
However, I also
know that they were

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
called mighty ones, due to
a cloak or garment that they

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
possessed.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It gave them
consciousness powers

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
that gave them the
Appalachian, the mighty ones.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Seeking the bones of
giants is one thing,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:84%
but seeking the powers of
their cloak and other apps

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:90%
is another.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's our game.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Prometheus rebelled against the
gods by first saving humanity

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and then by bringing humans
light or enlightenment

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and the secrets of
ascension, which he learned

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:90%
from the goddess Athena.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
During the days of Plato,
three centuries before

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the time of Jesus, the
play "Prometheus Bound"

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:90%
was often performed.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He was considered to be another
in a long line of saviors

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, great
prophets who were

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:84%
known as the Sons of
the Flame of Wisdom.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Prometheus saved humanity by
teaching man to stand upright,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:90%
according to the Greeks.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
He is the missing link between
Neanderthals and modern humans.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Prometheus was the one to
create the human body out

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:90%
of the clay of Earth.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
He did this after the
great deluge, or flood,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:90%
had wiped out humankind.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the biblical flood
which some believe corresponds

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
to the destruction of Atlantis.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So the story of
Prometheus is actually

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:84%
the story of the repopulating of
the world after this cataclysm

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:90%
and against the wishes of Zeus.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's the
story of our rebel race.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
In the story,
Prometheus traveled

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to the heart of the
golden sun, where

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
he stole fire, the means
of life, from Mount Olympus

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and gave it to mankind,
also against Zeus wishes.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Zeus then punished
Prometheus for his crime

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
by having him bound to a
rock while a great eagle ate

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
his liver every day, only
to have it regenerate

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:90%
to be eaten again the next day.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Zeus anger towards
Prometheus is in turn

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
responsible for mortal man's
having to provide for himself.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Before, all of man's needs had
been provided for by the gods.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the German
classicist Karl-Martin

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Dietz in Hesiod's
scriptures, Prometheus

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
represents the
descent of mankind

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
from the communion with the gods
into the present, troublesome

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
The Judeo-Christian
equivalent of this myth

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
is Lucifer, who has brought
the gift of consciousness

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So Prometheus is very
much with us today,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
and I believe he's rising.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Writers who express
caution about

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
the over-enthusiastic embrace
of new super technologies,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
such as Michael
Sandel, who worries

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
about human enhancement
and genetic engineering,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and Clive Hamilton, who
worries about geoengineering,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes warn us about
the Promethean Attitude,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:90%
or the Promethean Urge.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I worry about the rise
of technology, too.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
We're all now chained
together by the internet,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
which is also the new rock
upon which our world is built.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the way
we get off the rock

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that the
crucified Titan Prometheus is

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
none other than the divine
spark, the divine flame

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
within the heart of
every human being, who

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
was held captive and tortured
by all that would obliterate

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or diminish the indwelling
spiritual divinity.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic drama and
struggle of Prometheus

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
to become unbound from the
rock is enacted each day

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:90%
by every soul on Earth.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The divine flame that
Prometheus stole from heaven it

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
is the divine ray, or spark.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the soul.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's chained now
to the rocky Earth

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and is tortured,
eaten alive, by life.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The way out of Earth life
is not to attain immortality

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
by implanting machines within
us and becoming Promethean.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Achieving immortality will only
keep the eagle pecking at us

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:90%
for longer.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The way out of Earth life
this to attain illumination

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and to ascend.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
In the story, Prometheus
makes the human body,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
while the goddess
Athena looks on.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Athena, the goddess of
wisdom, daughter of Zeus,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
in this painting
waits to blow a soul

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
into the lifeless human form.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a common
pattern repeated

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:90%
in many creation mythologies.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Our soul was breathed into
the body by a divine being,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:90%
in this case Athena.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Athena is the one who not
only gave us our soul,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
but also gives the
newborn soul wisdom.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
What kind of wisdom?

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
A clue is found in this
statue of golden Prometheus

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
stealing fire in front of
Rockefeller Center in New York

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the most
photographed sculpture

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
in all of New York,
maybe even the world.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly one of the
world's most famous sculptures.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Sculpted by Paul
Manship in 1934,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the golden Prometheus
is seen as he descends

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
from Mount Olympus,
fire in hand,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
encircled by the ring of
the zodiac, which can also

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
be seen as a radiant ring of
cosmic sovereignty, a vibration

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
possessed by the gods.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Flanking the statue
of Prometheus

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:90%
are Youth and Maiden.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the first
humans created

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
by Prometheus out of clay.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Its central theme and the
clue to Athena's wisdom

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
is stated in the quote that
is carved in the red granite

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
wall behind him.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Taken from the 6th century
BC dramaticist as Aeschylus,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:84%
it reads, "Prometheus,
teacher in every art,

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
brought of fire that
had proved to mortals

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
a means to mighty ends."

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So Prometheus is
credited with bringing

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
the art of civilization to
humanity and a special fire,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
or light, that provided
the means to mighty ends.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
This refers to attaining
the mighty powers

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of the giants, the mighty
powers of enlightenment.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual or soul
powers are referred

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
to as the powers of the Titans,
the mighty ones, or the giants.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
soul apps, or powers,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:84%
we discussed in a
previous episode.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Through this public
art, John D. Rockefeller

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
sought to send a
Titanic message.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an example of what I call
Stargate Art, or the ascension

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
code, found in
artworks on display

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.400 align:middle line:84%
in the great cities
of the world.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
By seeing and decoding
the mystical references

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.240 align:middle line:84%
behind the symbols, we can find
hidden secrets of ascension

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.110 align:middle line:90%
hidden in plain sight.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
After Prometheus
stole fire, Zeus

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
sent Pandora in retaliation
for saving humankind,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
who Zeus sought to
obliterate with the flood.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Zeus ordered Hephaestus,
the Greek god of alchemy

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and technology, to create
Pandora, or fashion her out

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.450 align:middle line:84%
of clay, and brought her
to life by the four winds,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
with all the goddesses of
Olympus assembled to adorn her.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:84%
From her is the race of women
and femalekind, Hesiod writes.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We need to know
that Hephaestus is

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the Greek version of the
Sumerian god of technology,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Enki, who is shown
here enthroned.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
He's also the same as
the Egyptian Ptah, who

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is credited with fashioning
the human body in Egyptian myth

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and is also responsible
for creating

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.700 align:middle line:84%
all those amazing ancient
Egyptian technologies.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Zeus gave Pandora a box or a
jar, likely made by Hephaestus,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that she was not
allowed to open.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
This box was filled with
misfortunes, diseases,

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and plagues, while at the bottom
of the box there was also hope.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
According to mythologist
Barbara Walker,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:84%
the box was actually a pithos,
or a jar filled with blessings,

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and will be familiar to
readers of the story of Mary

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene and her alabaster
jar containing the Resurrection

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
oil called christos, or
chrism, that produced

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:90%
the light body of Jesus.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:38.200 align:middle line:84%
For ages, humans did
not know their soul

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
was the gift of Athena, or for
that matter what to do with it.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Prometheus then
came from the stars

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and lived among
humans to instruct us,

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:84%
to give us the tools for
living and for awakening

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual powers within.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
During the Italian Renaissance
of the 15th century,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
we witnessed a revival
in interest in Prometheus

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and the secret of
our soul's origins.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Masilio Ficino updated
the Prometheus myth.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Ficino can rightly be thought of
as the father of the modern New

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Age movement.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
He combined elements from
different religious traditions

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to unify early Christianity
and ancient mystical knowledge,

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
especially that of Egypt.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
He championed the power
of the imagination

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and the raising
of consciousness.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:84%
His work on the
immortality of the soul

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
gives us an idea
of his life's goal.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Ficino uniquely read
the Prometheus myth

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
as an image of the human soul
seeking to obtain supreme truth

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and the secret of returning
to our soul source and divine

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:90%
origin.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
light body in ascension here.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And as Olga Raggio
summarizes Ficino's text,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
"The torture of
Prometheus is the torment

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
brought by reason itself to man,
who is made by it many times

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:90%
more unhappy than the brutes.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
It is after having stolen one
beam of the celestial light

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
that the soul feels as
if fastened by chains,

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and only death can
release her bonds

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and carry her to the
source of all knowledge."

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the torment
of the awakened soul.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
By awakening, having stolen one
beam of the celestial light,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:90%
we realize our predicament.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Before our awakening,
we don't know

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
we are divine sparks
in chains on Earth.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But after seeing the light, we
want to return to our source,

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
but we realize there are
challenges on our path.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
After the writings of
Ficino about Prometheus,

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
interest in the Titans
shifted considerably

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of becoming
subject matter for painters

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and sculptors alike.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, Prometheus
becomes the model

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
for a new man who points us in
the right direction-- heaven.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Prometheus ascends to the sky
under the guidance of Minerva,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:90%
the Roman name for Athena.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And together, they soar
heavenward to the fire source,

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:90%
to the source of our souls.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
As Prometheus ascends,
in his right hand

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
he holds the pit of a fennel
stalk, which Hessia tells he

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:90%
carried back ablaze with life.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
In the center of the
painting is a chariot,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
pulled by two
dragon-like creatures.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
This symbolizes
Prometheus' theft of fire

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.220 align:middle line:84%
from the chariot of the
sun, anchored in mid-sky.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Plato described the
soul as the charioteer,

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and the soul must keep the
dragons going the same way.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Plato also describes
the great circuit,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
which souls make as
they follow the gods

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:90%
in the path of enlightenment.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
This chariot is the
ascension vehicle,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:90%
or ark throne of the gods.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise known as the
merkabah throne chariot,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%
it is the soul's vehicle.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
This celestial vehicle can be
thought of as a mobile throne.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:90%
We have mobile phones.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:84%
What we really want to
acquire is the mobile throne.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:10%
This is the soul's ultimate app.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.160 align:middle line:10%
And in my view,
as we established

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:10%
in previous episodes, it is
the same as the rainbow light

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:10%
body, unbound like
Prometheus, the wings

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:10%
of the angelic light body carry
our soul through the cosmos.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
It was Athena who gave us this
ultimate wisdom of the soul.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian mythology, her name
is Isis, which means throne,

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:90%
as in the throne chariot.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Athena's temple, the Parthenon,
located on the Acropolis

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
in Athens, Greece, was
Athena's temple of wisdom.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:84%
400 years before Mary,
Athena was the Virgin Queen.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to spend a few
moments with you now

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
exploring with you a copy of
the Parthenon in my backyard,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
People worldwide know Nashville
as Music City USA, Tone Town,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Twang Town, etc.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Less well known is the
fact that Nashville

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is the only city in the world
with copies of two healing

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
temples from the
ancient world, and both

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:90%
are temples of ascension.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:10%
In 1897, the state of
Tennessee celebrated

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:10%
100 years of statehood.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:10%
Because Nashville was called
the Athens of the South,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:10%
her fair people built a
re-creation of the Parthenon

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.140 align:middle line:10%
to commemorate the centennial.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:10%
The attraction was so popular
that a permanent structure

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:10%
was built in the 1920s.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Accurate to an
eighth of an inch,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
this museum, as it was called,
is actually a scale replica

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
of Athena's Temple of Wisdom.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It is a jewel in the
heart of Nashville.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
In addition to Music
City, Nashville

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is also known as the
buckle of the Bible belt,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
due to the enormous
Bible-publishing

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:90%
industry found here.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
"Seeing the light" is also
a big part of country music.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
The interesting
thing about this is

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that when the
Parthenon was built

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:84%
in Nashville in the
1920s, another temple

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:90%
was also constructed nearby.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:10%
This one is located
on a hill downtown,

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:10%
next to the Tennessee
State capital.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Inside is a magnificent
statue of the Roman god Mars.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
I call this hill Mars Hill, and
this temple the Temple of Mars.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that the
city forefathers

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:84%
wanted to link modern
Nashville to ancient Athens,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
in particular, Athens
at the time of Jesus

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and the apostle Paul, who
also famously saw the light.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
In circa 35 AD, a man
named Saul of Tarsus

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.770 align:middle line:84%
was on his way to
Damascus when suddenly

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
a Promethean bright light from
heaven flashed around him.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
The resurrected Jesus was in
that light in his light body

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Saul was blinded by the light.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:84%
After three days, his
vision was restored,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and Saul became
Paul, a preacher.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
In a flash, a Promethean
flash, Paul was born again.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And Paul's awakened
soul was introduced

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to a new reality
in which beings can

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.730 align:middle line:84%
turn their flesh into light
and open holes in the fabric

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime-- wormholes.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
With the opening
came a burst of love

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that made Paul
realize he is part

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
of a creation beyond his
earthly comprehension.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
happened to the Buddha,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
meaning of the Dorje

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:90%
in the hand of Padmasambhava.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
After his experience on
the road to Damascus,

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Paul went to Athens to tell the
story of the resurrected man

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Jesus.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
And he noted that
Athens was a pagan city

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and that it had several temples.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
He specifically
listed the Parthenon

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:90%
and the Temple of Mars.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Paul was preaching
about the new resurrected man

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:90%
from Mars Hill.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Clare and I lived beside
this magnificent temple.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
We travel a lot, and
it's also very special

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to come home to this spot
of solace and healing.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I visit it every day I'm
home on my daily walk.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's my place of
meditation and reflection.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
I sit on the Parthenon
steps and give thanks

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
for all the experiences that
have made up my hologram.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you have a spot
like that you return to again

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:90%
and again like a touchstone.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
spots is found

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
on each end of the
Parthenon, where

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
we find the largest matched set
of bronze doors in the world.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:90%
They weigh 8 and 1/2 tons each.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The matched set of
lions on these doors

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
symbolize the lion's gate,
or the path of ascension.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
These doors of initiation
are almost never opened.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:10%
But one day, a band was
shooting a music video,

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:10%
and the doors were open,
revealing the tallest

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:10%
indoor statue in the Western
world, a 42-foot-tall statue

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:10%
of Athena covered
in 24-carat gold.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
She is the goddess
of wisdom who holds

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.200 align:middle line:90%
the angel of victory, Nike.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.880 align:middle line:90%
This is the victorious soul.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that statue
is 6 feet 4 inches tall

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:90%
and weighs 400 pounds.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Nashville sculptor Alan
LeQuire did extensive research

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.072 align:middle line:84%
before sculpting his
masterpiece of Athena in 1982.

00:19:05.072 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
He aimed to as closely
approximate the original as

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:10%
And one can only wonder
if it is possible

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:10%
that the apostle Paul saw
something like this statue

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:10%
or if, in fact, it was the
inspiration for his letters

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:10%
to the officiants
about the armor of God.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:10%
The reason I say this is that
when we look closely at Athena,

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:10%
we see that she wears a
crown of wisdom, symbolized

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:10%
by the Sphinx on
top of her head.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.180 align:middle line:84%
She wears a golden goat
skin agis, or breastplate,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:90%
bearing the Gorgon.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
She wears a belt of truth, and
she stands in sandals of peace.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly
what Paul describes

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:84%
as the armor of
God in his letters

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to the people of
Ephesus, Turkey.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Athena is wearing the
garments of the high priest,

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:84%
all the ascension
apps of the soul,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
right down to the
sandals of peace.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, Athena also
holds her famous spear, which

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
was made for her by Hephaestus.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:10%
At its base is a
coiled, golden serpent,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:20.320 align:middle line:10%
concealed by a golden shield,
Paul's shield of faith.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, symbolically, what
we're looking at here

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is a goddess, or a priestess,
holding an axis or pillar

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
with a coiled serpent.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, reminds us
of Eve from the Garden of Eden

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So what or who, then,
is that coiled serpent?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The rising serpent
has nothing to do

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:90%
with a reptile or an animal.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the
reptilian code again.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
In eastern mystical traditions,
the coiled and rising serpent

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.280 align:middle line:84%
is symbolic of rising
kundalini energy,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the primal sacred energy located
at the base of the spine.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It is symbolic because the
rising energy would appear

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.935 align:middle line:84%
as a serpent wrapped
around and ascending

00:21:05.935 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:90%
a staff, our spinal column.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Rising kundalini
energy feels like

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
an electric current
running along the spine.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
The first time it
happened to me,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
an awakened person touched
me, and the kundalini

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
ran like a serpent or
zipper up my spine.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:25.490 align:middle line:84%
This told me that this
energy is directly

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:90%
transmittable or activate-able.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.340 align:middle line:84%
In ultimate
experiences, kundalini

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
produces a state
of bliss that is

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
beyond the perception
of the human mind

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and the five senses and organs.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.110 align:middle line:84%
In this state, one has the
Promethean powers of creation,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:90%
and all things are possible.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the great teaching
of the esoteric traditions.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It is a spiritual awakening
that can bring forth

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:84%
healing, empowerment,
enlightenment, and wisdom.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a
lot of difference

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.796 align:middle line:84%
between kundalini and soul, or
atman in the Hindu tradition.

00:22:05.796 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is viewed as
the awareness of the soul.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Just as the heart is the
principal center or organ

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.605 align:middle line:84%
of the circulatory
system and the brain

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system, similarly
the kundalini energy system

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:84%
has various centers, or
chakras, channels, and ducks.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini energy system has
been called the human form

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:84%
of the divine consciousness
or cosmic consciousness,

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.510 align:middle line:90%
absolute purity, or super soul.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The yogis meditate
on super soul.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
There are 72,000 subtle
channels called nadi.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And of these channels, the
three main subtle channels

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
are the sushumna nadi, that
is, the central channel that

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
extends from the base of the
spine to the top of the head;

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
the pingala or surya
or sun nadi, that is,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the channel that runs to the
right of the sushumna nadi;

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and the ida or
chandra or moon nadi,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.507 align:middle line:84%
that is, the channel that runs
to the left of the sushumna

00:23:03.507 --> 00:23:04.850 align:middle line:90%
nadi.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:10%
The caduceus wand symbolizes
the central channel,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:10%
with the two serpents running
along it symbolizing the ida

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.700 align:middle line:10%
and pingala nadas.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:10%
In the hand of Mercury,
it symbolizes his ability

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:10%
to travel between
worlds and to conduct

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:10%
souls between
dimensions, affirming

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:10%
it is some form of a
soul transfer technology.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.670 align:middle line:10%
In annunciation paintings,
the archangel Gabriel

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:10%
uses this wand to conduct
the soul of Christ

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:10%
and the Holy Spirit into the
body of the Virgin Mary, who

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:10%
must have experienced a
kundalini soul awakening

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:10%
during this process.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It seemed obvious that the
ancient priests and priestesses

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and angels must have
had access to knowledge

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
about spiritual awakening,
kundalini energy,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
lifting the serpent, and what
it means and how it works.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
It's also apparent
that kundalini

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
is the fuel put on the fire
Prometheus stole from the sun

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and is the fuel of the
soul and its ascension.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if it's the thunder and
lightning bolt of enlightenment

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
or the plasma dorje
of the Tibetans.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Just like the dorje
symbolizes compassion

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.050 align:middle line:84%
in action, activated
kundalini energy

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and the power that
accompanies it prompts us

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.780 align:middle line:90%
to be more ethical and moral.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the responsibility
of the individual

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to use all their
power of all kinds

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:90%
wisely and compassionately.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And to the Buddhists, the
key benefit of awakening

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is the observer realizes and
can detach from material objects

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and things as a source of
suffering and happiness.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Happiness then comes from
the inside, not the outside,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:84%
of the awakened observer, who
realizes that he or she is

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:90%
part of the creation.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And with the realization,
the chains of Prometheus

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:90%
are broken.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So now the question is,
how do we lift the serpent?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
A place to begin is with
my daily visualization.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
In my meditation
at the Parthenon,

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
I stand in front
of the bronze doors

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and visualize the doors
opening and Athena assisting me

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:90%
in lifting the serpent within.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
You can do this by taking
a screen shot of Athena

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
or even Athena beside
the high priest.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Now after focusing and centering
your attention on the image,

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
intend that the crown of
wisdom be placed on your head,

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that your heart
chakra will be open

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and you will wear the
breastplate of righteousness,

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
that you will wear
the belt of truth,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and that you will stand
in the sandals of peace.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
As we've explored, these
are the soul ascension apps,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
or the ascension
apps of the soul.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Now you can add that you intend
for the serpent of healing

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and light to rise within you.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the hidden app.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And as it does,
you see your skin

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:84%
turning golden and
radiant, and you

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
intend for a golden
shield or seal of light

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:90%
to surround your body.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:84%
We have just connected
our consciousness

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to Athena and other
divine beings.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
For visualization
purposes, here are

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
a few more examples of Athena
for you to contemplate.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The first example is a
statue in the National

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Museum in Naples, Italy.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.080 align:middle line:10%
When I came upon this, I
was mind-blown by the power

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:10%
of her cape.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Next we have Botticelli's
palace and the centaur.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
This one was directed
by Masilio Ficino.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
This is an important example,
as Athena wears a transparent

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:90%
gown tipped with diamonds.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
This is symbolic of what's
called the diamond body,

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.800 align:middle line:90%
or the light body.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
She also wears a diamond
on her activated third eye.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
In this example of
Our Lady of Guadalupe,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Athena's golden robe is the
same as the golden light

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
body of the other virgin,
the Lady of Guadalupe,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:84%
who manifested, like
Jesus, in a flash.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we have
to realize here

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is that this golden
cloak of Athena that

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.220 align:middle line:84%
emerges from our
lifted kundalini,

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
or lifting the serpent, is
also the Golden Fleece sought

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%
by Jason and the Argonauts.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:10%
In Greek mythology,
the Golden Fleece

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:10%
is the fleece of the
gold-hair winged ram.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It is a symbol of
authority and sovereignty,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and it plays a central role
in the story of the hero Jason

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and the Argonauts.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Jason about to
seize the Golden Fleece.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
The stern of the Argo
is seen at the right.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Jason led the Argonauts,
a band of adventurers

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.280 align:middle line:84%
who set out on the ship Argo,
to steal the magical Golden

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Fleece of a mystical
ram, which was preserved

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:90%
in Colchis on the Black Sea.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
With the help of the gods
and the sorceress Medea,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Jason was able to take the
fleece from a grove protected

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.640 align:middle line:90%
by a dragon.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Here with Athena beside him,
he reaches for the fleece.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.860 align:middle line:84%
On the famed Douris Cup, Athena
is shown wearing her goat skin

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:84%
aegis bearing the Gorgon and a
helmet bearing a winged lioness

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and is holding an
owl and her spear.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the Golden
Fleece hangs in a tree.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:10%
Now Jason is being regurgitated
by the dragon guarding

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:10%
the tree, an obvious
reference to kundalini.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.130 align:middle line:10%
Peleus sent Jason to retrieve
the magical fleece of gold that

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:10%
had been created
by Hermes and kept

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:10%
in the grove in the
far-off land of Colchis.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Jason and the fellow Argonauts
battle the guardian dragon

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Golden Fleece.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.540 align:middle line:84%
The serpent is
coiled like kundalini

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:84%
around the sacred tree from
which the fleece hangs.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Fleece produced
by the mystic lamb

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the robe
of light of Athena.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the robe of
glory of the soul,

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and I believe it's the
light body shot with gold.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the original light
body of Adam and Eve.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And remember, Athena is
the re-creation of Eve.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the light body for
Adam and Eve and Athena,

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:50.330 align:middle line:84%
just as it is for Padmasambhava
and [INAUDIBLE] in the Tibetan

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.410 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the Hebrew word
for the fruit eaten by Eve

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of
Eden that causes

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:84%
them to lose their
original light body form

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:90%
is a general term.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The idea that Adam
and Eve ate an apple

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:84%
and then lost their
light body garment

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.100 align:middle line:84%
comes from the Greek
tradition, where

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
it's known as the Golden
Apple of Prometheus,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
or the Golden Apple
of the Hesperides.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
In this painting by the Limbourg
brothers, the serpent of Eden

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is coiled around a tree, and
it's a golden serpent again.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And this golden serpent
offers a golden apple to Eve.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.300 align:middle line:84%
These golden apples were
famously stolen by Hercules

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:90%
as one of his 12 labors.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.220 align:middle line:84%
En route to the
golden apples, he

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:84%
liberates Prometheus, the
fire-stealer, or soul guider,

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
from his punishment
at the hands of Zeus.

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And Prometheus in
turns bequeaths

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Hercules with valuable
knowledge on how to acquire

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:90%
the golden apples successfully.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Here we see the
golden apple tree

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
in the Garden of the Hesperides
depicted on a vase from 410 BC.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:84%
A serpent entwines
around an apple tree

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:90%
with its golden fruit.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.280 align:middle line:84%
The names of the figures
are written on the vase.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Two Hesperides stand on
the left side of the tree.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Their names are
Chrysothemis, which

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
means Golden Order, and
Asterope, or Star Face.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:84%
To the right of the apple tree
is Lipara, or Shining Skin,

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
who holds golden apples
in the veil of her dress

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and raises the veil
off her shoulder.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The names of the goddesses
describe exactly what

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.540 align:middle line:84%
they are like, a shining star,
a golden being with shining skin

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.410 align:middle line:90%
who live in a golden realm.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
These have to be the same
golden beings who gave Perseus

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:84%
three crucial tools to defeat
the dreaded Gorgon, the Medusa,

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.560 align:middle line:90%
like the one on Athena's chest.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
All who looked at her
would turn to stone.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That's how ugly she was
said to be in Greek myth.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But Athena gave
Perseus her shield

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
that was polished like a mirror,
and Hermes gave him his sword.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.710 align:middle line:84%
However, Perseus needed
three additional tools.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.990 align:middle line:84%
They were sandals that could
enable the wearer to fly,

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.480 align:middle line:84%
a bag that could hold
anything, and a cap

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:90%
that made him invisible.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Obviously these are
ascension tools or apps.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the belief among
numerous ancient cultures

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that across the ocean
towards the west

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.740 align:middle line:84%
there existed a
bless isle that was

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.510 align:middle line:84%
the home of the
successful souls,

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:33.120 align:middle line:90%
or virtuous or perfect souls.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They called it the Garden of
the Hesperides, the Fortunate

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Isles, the Elysian Fields,
the Garden of Eden.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Homer said these fields,
planes, or dimensions

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
were located on the
Western edge of the Earth

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.530 align:middle line:84%
by the Stream of Oceanus,
the enormous river that

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:90%
encircles the earth.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian sought to "walk
the west," so to speak.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And as we will see
in the next episode,

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:84%
so, too, did the
Native Americans,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and there is a
very special garden

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.350 align:middle line:84%
in a Native American
sacred space that

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.290 align:middle line:84%
marks a place where
souls came to learn

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to leap into the afterlife
through a portal.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:90%
Until next time, be humble.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Let your light shine.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.385 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.
