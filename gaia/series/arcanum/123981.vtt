00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Hello.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm William Henry.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Awakened Soul."

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:84%
In the previous episode,
we concluded with a phrase

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:84%
from the Gnostic
Gospel of Philip

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
regarding a perfect light
that illuminates the soul.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.765 align:middle line:10%
"But when it, the perfect light,
is revealed," says this gospel,

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:10%
"then the perfect light
will flow out on every one.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And all those who are in it will
receive the chrism, the oil.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Then the slaves will be free
and the captives ransomed."

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:84%
This statement is
incredibly hopeful.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It says that one day a perfect
or holy light will be revealed

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and that it will
flow out on everyone

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and we will all shine
in the light of freedom.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the gnostic
promise to free the soul

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
from its entrapment or
enslavement in matter

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and return it to
its eternal source.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot more
packed in this statement.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Philip actually tells
us how this soul freedom

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.640 align:middle line:90%
can be achieved.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
He says we will receive an oil.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Chrism is referred
to by the gnostics

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
as the Oil of Resurrection.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
This astounding
oil is well known

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in ancient stories
about ascension,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and we will explore
it here in conjunction

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
with other soul-rising
technologies.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The best place to
begin is with the story

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
of the pre-flood prophet Enoch.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.310 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Enoch,
he was taken into heaven

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
by the archangel
Michael, who anointed him

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
with a holy oil that dissolved
his body into glorified rainbow

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
light that made him
the same as the angels.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
As the Book of Enoch says,
"and the Lord said to Michael,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
take Enoch and strip him
of his earthly garments

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and anoint him
with the holy oil,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and clothe him in the
garments of glory.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And Michael stripped
me of my garments

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and anointed me
with the holy oil.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And I looked at
myself, and I was

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:10%
one of the glorious ones,
one of the Perfect Ones,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and there was no
difference and all my fear

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:10%
and trembling left me."

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this
describes Enoch's attainment

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:84%
of the perfect robe of the
soul, the robe of light,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or the rainbow light body of
the Tibetan great perfection

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
tradition, although the Tibetan
tradition does not mention

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
an oil as part of this process.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Later, Jesus had
this same experience

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
when Mary Magdalene
anointed him with the chrism

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:90%
from her alabaster jar.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
This sacred oil is the
most important element

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
in the transformation of
Enoch, a human, into an angel

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
or an ascended being of light.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
3 Enoch tells us that the
oil's appearance is greater

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:84%
than the greatest
light and its ointment

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is like sweet dew and
the fragrance like myrrh

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:90%
and it is like from paradise.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, the oil
shines as brightly as the sun.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The oil causes
Enoch's face to shine

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
like the faces of the
angels, which in turn shine

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
like the face of God.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Clues to the composition
of this incredible oil

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
are found in the tradition
of Adam's third son

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Seth, and his mission to Eden
to acquire the oil of mercy.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
In my view, this is
likely the chrism.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
In the story, at
the age of 900 Adam

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
falls ill and bids all
his sons to come to him.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Seth offers to go to paradise
to get the fruit of paradise,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
but Adam refuses.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he bids Eve and Seth
to go to paradise and pray

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to God to give them of the tree
out of which the oil floweth.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.350 align:middle line:84%
When they arrive, God
sends the archangel Michael

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to refuse Seth
this oil of mercy,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
but to promise him that it shall
be given to the holy people

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:90%
at the end of time.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Michael tells Seth that the oil
will be used in the end times

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
for those who will be worthy
of entering the garden.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is certainly quite
a provocative statement,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:84%
as many believe that we
live in the overlapping

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
period between the end of
the one age or cosmic cycle

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of another.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So could this oil be awaiting
discovery by us to take us

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:90%
into the garden, the cosmos?

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
The oil, says Michael, will be
used to transform or to assist

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
in the transition or ascension
of the righteous souls

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
into celestial or
star beings, and will

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
assist in the soul's
voyage or journey home

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
through the wormhole
to the open heaven.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
In the story, Seth
is given three seeds

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:90%
from the Tree of Life.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
He returns with
these and places them

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:90%
in the mouth of his dead father.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
In Christian legend,
these three ethereal seeds

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
grew into the tree that produced
the wooden pillar upon which

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, the second
Adam, was crucified.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the
Cathars of southern France

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:10%
created this cryptic watermark
of a serpent winding up

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:10%
the tree or cross and spitting
from its mouth three rings

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:10%
or seeds.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
These could be the
three seeds that

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
correspond to the cintamani
or wish-fulfilling jewels

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that manifest the rainbow
body in the Tibetan tradition.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
This is why I believe the
symbol of the cintamani

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
is on the book in Jesus'
hand in this sixth century

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
icon from the
Sinai, and why it's

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:84%
on his robe of the soul in
this incredible depiction

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
from Italy.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The triple dot symbol
signifies his attainment

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
of the light body.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
My wife Clare and I
use essential oils

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:90%
as part of our self-care kit.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They deliver awesome
results, keeping us

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.927 align:middle line:90%
well and spiritually balanced.

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
As we learned in the
previous episode,

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.910 align:middle line:84%
they interact with one of
the sheaths of the soul

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:90%
to produce their results.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
We have also made
massive studies

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
of the ancients'
knowledge of sacred oils

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're attempting to find
out just what the seeds were

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that produced this light
body oil, the chrism.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
The ancients assuredly knew that
these sacred plants or trees

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
produce the holy
oil, the chrism.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The oils, they
tell us, were used

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:84%
as part of ancient ascension
practices, called theurgy

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:84%
or the divine work of
perfecting the soul that

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
culminated in the
attainment of the ascension

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
or the light body.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:84%
In sacred oil
philosophy, plants act

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
as collectors or
receivers of interstellar

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:90%
or cosmic frequency.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And when distilled into an
oil, they carry this frequency

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and make it accessible to the
human body and to the soul.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And as Clare and I
discussed in "Arcanum,"

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
nowhere is this understanding
of the cosmic vibrations

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
in oils more prominent
than ancient Egypt.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Especially incredible is
the ancient Egyptian use

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
of sacred oils as part
of a soul-rising or soul

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
resurrection and
ascension technology.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a detail from the
spectacular golden throne

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of Tutankhamen.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
His wife, Ankhesenamun,
anoints him

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred oil that
enabled the spirit of God

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:90%
to enter into Tutankhamen.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We see the sacred blue
lotus flower on the stand

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:90%
beside them.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
To the ancient
Egyptians, the blue lotus

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of the rebirth of
the sun and the awakened soul.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians believed
that the soul of the deceased

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
came to reside in
the heavens as a star

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and would ride the
wormhole-shaped boat

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:90%
or ark of eternity forever.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:84%
What we notice here is that both
the bow and stern of this soul

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
ship are decorated with
blue lotus flowers,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
highlighting the role of
this flower or perhaps

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
its essential oil in
the ascension process.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
The resurrection of the
human soul in the afterlife

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
was the central fact of the
ancient Egyptian religion,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
wrote the poet and
Egyptologist Gerald Massey.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And the transfigured
or re-erected mummy,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
otherwise called the karast,
was the supreme symbol.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
This is Tutankhamen as
a transfigured being

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
in the karast garment or body
with the ouroburos symbol

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:84%
of eternity surrounding
him from his gilt shrine.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Charles Muses proposed
that the Egyptians

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
had developed a technology in
which tones, lights, and an as

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
yet unidentified plant are
used to open a rusty valve

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
or trigger the production
of large pulses of hormones,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:84%
similar to the ecdysone produced
by larval forms of insects,

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
which allows the
adult form to emerge.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
In this way, they would allow
the gestation or mutation

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
of a non-molecular
body, a new skin that

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
would allow the survival
of consciousness

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:90%
beyond physical death.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I have equated this new skin to
the Tibetan rainbow light body.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. muses points
out, we see three rays

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
or beams of starpower
energy entering the forehead

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
of the pupal Osiris.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.000 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, the etheric
energy or quintessence

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
was represented in the form
of the five-pointed sba star.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The word sba, or
star, also means door.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And with the
determinative for walking,

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
it meant passing through
a star door, said Muses.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, how about a stargate?

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
All of this brings
us to a key point

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egyptian
ethnobotany, said Muses.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Ingestion of these sacred
materials, these oils,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
was designed not merely to give
a high, as with the blue lotus,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:84%
but to trigger and impel the
metamorphic process leading

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to a theurgic transmutation
of human nature

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
into apotheosis or divinity.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:84%
This process was overseen by
cosmic regions, the living

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
archetypes of stellar
powers, said Muses,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and to attain the awareness
of these star powers or beings

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is part of our goal,
because over and over again

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egyptian
ascension stories,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
we hear of cosmic
beings assisting us

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:90%
in completing our own ascension.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we don't
have to do it alone.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The great secret
of ancient Egypt

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
centers on this theurgy
or divine work and the use

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:84%
of divine tones,
lights, and plants

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that enable one
to raise the soul

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and self-realize
their light body.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamen was the finale of
Egypt's famed 18th dynasty,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
a time of magic and
mystery that gave us

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:84%
some of history's
greatest purveyors

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
of the secrets of ascension,
including Hatshepsut,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the starchild who
became a pharaoh

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and married a commoner
who discovered

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of transfiguration.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Her successor Thutmosis
III, the so-called Napoleon

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt, who
the Rosicrucians claim

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is their founder
and the producer

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
of a mystical white
powder of gold

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that fed the light
bodies of the pharaohs,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:84%
took on the mantle
of Hatshepsut.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:84%
In circa 1350 BC, the 18th
dynasty and the Egyptian empire

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:84%
was at the height of
its accomplishment.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamen's father, a mystic
and visionary pharaoh named

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
Akhenaten, came to the throne.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And he promptly launched a
religious revolution in Egypt,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
shaking it to its core, shaking
a religion to its core that had

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.400 align:middle line:90%
a 3,000-year history.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
He began his rule by
forbidding worship

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:84%
of all the pantheon of
ancient Egyptian gods,

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:84%
replacing the old-time
gods, the old-time religion,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
with the new religion
of the disc called aton.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The aton, or the uh-tone, was
symbolized by the sun disc

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.950 align:middle line:90%
emanating rays.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
However, the aton
was not the sun.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
The aton was the light
that illuminated the sun.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It was the universal
spiritual presence or force,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:90%
a soul-force, if you will.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And contact with
its mystic light

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:84%
brought about a
mystic rapture, which

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
is but another name for the
attainment of the rainbow body

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:90%
of light or the light body.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The disc worship
images were almost all

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
created according to the
same formula, Akhenaten

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
standing in front of an
altar offering a jar of oil

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to the aton while Nefertiti
stands behind him,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%
also offering a jar of oil.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Both are seen
inhaling or breathing

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:10%
in the rejuvenating
ankh, or key of life,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:10%
just like the Christian
Holy Spirit is inhaled

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:10%
or breathed in.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And by means of theurgical
rites or magical rites,

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten and Nefertiti
breathes in divine

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
illuminating fire
or light of the aton

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and incorporates the divine
light into their own being.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The word theurgy relates to
the Greek word theogogia,

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
which refers to a
drawing in or a drawing

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:90%
down of a divine force.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:84%
The result of drawing
in or inhaling

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
is the illumination and
ascension of the soul.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And here we note
that Nefertiti wears

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
a transparent pleated linen
a robe tied with a sash.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian symbolism, this
symbolizes her attainment

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife
garment of the soul.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that
this scene indicates

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that she is weaving this garment
or sheath from strands of light

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
from aton, or in fact that she
is preparing to anoint herself

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
with an oil that
will do this for her?

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Scans of the famed
King Tut burial chamber

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
have revealed two hidden
rooms that could contain

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:90%
metal or organic material.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The remains of Nefertiti
could be inside,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
along with incredible clues
to the light body, I am sure.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the key of life,
it's intriguing to point out

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:90%
a bit of wordplay.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The word aton could
be pronounced ay-tone,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:84%
suggesting an anointing
by a tone or a vibration.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
The idea that our sun emits or
rains a key of life upon Earth

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
is actually based
on solid science,

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
for our sun is actually like
a giant musical instrument.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The entire sun vibrates
from a complex pattern

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
of acoustical waves.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:10%
It actually rings like
a bell and vibrates

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:10%
like an organ pipe.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:10%
In fact, scientists
estimate that the sun

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:10%
has 10 million keys or notes.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the National Optical
Astronomy Observatory

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
says we can learn a lot
by listening to the sun.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
This NOAO image from an
article on solar music

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:84%
shows the pattern of
up and down movement

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
from a single
solar musical note.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Red is up and blue is down.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
actual solar surface

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.005 align:middle line:84%
showing the up and
down pattern of all 10

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:07.565 align:middle line:84%
million solar musical
notes played at once.

00:16:07.565 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Another ancient Egyptian
belief about the sun,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that it is a tunnel
to heaven, is also

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
supported by a new study that
suggests that wormholes might

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:90%
exist between distant stars.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So is the sun actually the
way the soul gets to heaven?

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Scientists at the Eurasian
National University

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:84%
in Kazakhstan say that instead
of being empty tunnels,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
these wormholes would
contain what they describe

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
as a perfect fluid, a
quark-gluon plasma that

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
flows back and forth
between the two stars.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:90%
A perfect fluid?

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that our sun
produces the oil of perfection

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:90%
or the chrism?

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Or does the sun send
tones that activate

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.295 align:middle line:90%
the oil within our soul?

00:17:01.295 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of questions
like this to be asked,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and science, I believe,
is on the verge

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:90%
of discovering the answers.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Shown here is one of
the most famous images

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:90%
from the reign of Akhenaten.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
It's now housed in the
Neues Museum in Berlin.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
What we see is the aton
beaming ankhs or keys of life,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
notes to the noses of
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
and three of their
six daughters.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten and Nefertiti are
seen inhaling the key of life

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:35.620 align:middle line:84%
from the aton because the key of
life is actually dipped in oil.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Followers of this
mystic couple had

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:84%
copies of this tablet
set up in their homes,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and through the imagery
would participate

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:90%
in this ceremony with them.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So taking the wordplay, one
wonders if the key of life

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is literally a key
tone or vibration

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
from the aton or atone
disc that makes one at one

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:90%
with the cosmos.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Some proposed that Akhenaten is
actually kissing his daughter

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:90%
in this image.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
However, on closer inspection,
something far more mystical

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:90%
is taking place.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
He appears to be breathing or
transmitting the key of life

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
into the nostrils
of his daughter.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:84%
This was duplicated in
the later Jewish account

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of man
when the Book of Genesis

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
says, "then the Lord God formed
man of the dust from the ground

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and man became a living being."

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The key to this scene
is Akhenaten's daughter,

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
who points to the
Egyptian hieroglyph mist.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
This glyph resembles
a three-fold fall

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:90%
of radiating water.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It means celestial
tears, dew, or mist,

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and portrays drops
of water or vibration

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
raining or radiating
from the aton.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
The same hieroglyphic also
means instruction or teaching,

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
leading us to the pun
that this glyph stands

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
for the mysteries of the soul
raining down from heaven.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
This glyph is also found in
the hieroglyph for the aakhu,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:90%
meaning beings of light, i.e.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
wise, instructed
folk and the sun.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:10%
In Budge's
hieroglyphic dictionary

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:10%
are the following additional
definitions of aakhu,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:10%
to be bright, glorious; to
be excellent and renowned.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:10%
It also means transfigured
beings or shining ones.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The threefold fall of divine
light, tones, or rings

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:84%
made its way into
Christian symbolism,

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:84%
where it symbolizes
the Holy Spirit.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
What we see is Jesus standing
in a triple-ray glyph

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
in transfiguration scenes
in which the Holy Spirit is

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
transmitted into his
body and he acquires

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
the garment of light,
the garment of love-light

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:90%
to be more correct.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It's apparent that this
atunement or atonement

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
in which Akhenaten
transmits the key of life

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.520 align:middle line:84%
to his daughter that enables
her to weave her light body

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
was recovered 1,300 years later
by the Essenes, predominantly

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Jewish mystics living
in Jerusalem and Egypt

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
who were also heavily
influenced by Buddhism.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist, Mary, all
the disciples were Essenes.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is
that this atunement

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is the subject of Christ's book
in this icon from the Sinai.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And evidence of the recovery
of the hidden knowledge

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of the secret light of
the aton that illuminates

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
our soul is found in
the Christian practice

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:90%
called Pentecost.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:84%
50 days after the
Resurrection, the cosmic Christ

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
appeared to the disciples
in the upper room,

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.960 align:middle line:84%
which is a metaphor
for the inner chamber

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.340 align:middle line:90%
of the temple in our mind.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
He transmitted the
vibration of the Holy Spirit

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.100 align:middle line:90%
to the disciples.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We see them with
illuminated halos,

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and also we see them
with flames coming out

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of the top of their head that
indicate their consciousness

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:90%
has been changed.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:90%
They are now illuminated beings.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The images of Akhenaten
and Nefertiti in the aton

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and the disciples with
the adon or the Lord

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:35.820 align:middle line:84%
are interchangeable, suggesting
a continuous transmission

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:90%
of this mystic soul teaching.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Proverbs
says that the soul of man

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%
is God's candle.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:10%
A candle is a vessel that
includes a wick and oil that

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:10%
must be lit with a flame.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So the message here is
that we must each lift

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
our candle of a mysterious
and divine light

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that produces an oil that
illuminates our soul.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And by raising up the
candle, we not only

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:84%
reveal the soul in
the body, but we

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
clarify that the body is made
to be a vessel for the soul.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Jewish mysticism teaches
that the candle must be lit

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
until the flame can stand
alone, without any further need

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:90%
for the one who lit it.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The soul comes into the body
to use his or her own strength

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to act and thereby
become a partner with God

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:90%
in the creation of the world.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
lighted candle was

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of the
first Christians, who

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%
called themselves Illuminati.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So call it the aton or the light
of God, this light from the sun

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
or the light that illuminates
the sun is an activator

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.880 align:middle line:90%
or attractor of souls.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:10%
And it is upon this light
that we are raptured or ascend

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:10%
to heaven.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to leave
you with a meditation

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
on Botticelli's famous
Madonna of the Magnificat.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The title of the
painting derives

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:84%
from the word magnificat, which
is written in the book held

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.680 align:middle line:90%
by the two angels.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The prayer begins, "my
soul magnifies the Lord."

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The word magnifies means
enlarges, boosts, enhances,

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:84%
maximizes, amplifies,
expands, glorifies.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that the soul
is like a lens magnifying

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:90%
the image.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And here we see
the Virgin anointed

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
by the hidden sun, the aton,
with 12 crowns of apocalypse.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the angel
on the left-hand side.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The angel is inhaling the
rays from the hidden sun.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So this scene from ancient
Egypt and Botticelli's scene

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.210 align:middle line:84%
are showing us exactly
the same thing.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of the
ages of nearly 3,000 years,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
we see people practicing
theurgy, or drawing in

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:90%
or drawing down a divine force.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Both images tell the story of
the awakening, illumination,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and perfection of the soul.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Further, they are
telling us that our body

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:84%
is like a radio that is
switched on but emits no sound.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
However, through the use of
tones, lights, and plants,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:84%
the soul can be retuned
so that the signal which

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
has been there all along can
be received and utilized.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:90%
So just imagine.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a
group of initiates

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:10%
on our path of ascension and
we enter the upper chamber

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:10%
of a magnificent temple.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.510 align:middle line:84%
We gather in a circle
around a translucent table,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
a table made by angels,
a table composed

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of an ethereal substance known
as the wish-fulfilling jewel,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.100 align:middle line:84%
the blue substance
of heaven that's

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.980 align:middle line:84%
mixed with a pure
earthly substance.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
We each take a
seat at this table.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:84%
A beam of sunlight illuminates
the table and touching it,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
connects us instantly
to a soothing vibration.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We anoint our forehead
with the sacred oil

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol of the recognition
of God's spirit within us.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We unite our heart and
mind as a living soul,

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.540 align:middle line:84%
one with all souls,
with the universe.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this,
we are immediately

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
transported to an
interior dimension

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
where we are at one
with all that is.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And from the heart
of this realm comes

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:84%
a divine light that fills
the room with flames

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.760 align:middle line:90%
of a brilliant peace and joy.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
You breathe it in deeply into
the center of your being.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And as it rises up your candle,
your spinal cord system,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
it ignites into a flame
in your pineal gland

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to experience a
holy communion with the highest

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:84%
spiritual being you can imagine,
radiant, glowing, glorious.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And with this being, you sound
a sacred ohm or you sing amen.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, be humble, let
your light shine, and namaste.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.178 align:middle line:90%
