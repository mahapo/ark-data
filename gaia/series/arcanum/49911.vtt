00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: Is there
a more subtle, spiritual,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.360 align:middle line:84%
healing, and inter-dimensional
life force energy or light?

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a higher
or perhaps faster

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
vibration in it that
requires a shift

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
of our learned and
habitual perception for us

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to sense, register,
and interpret?

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE HENRY: Numerous
spiritual traditions

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
speak of a holy
light-- a sacred light

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that transforms
humans on contact.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:84%
The secrets of this light
are next on "Arcanum."

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Many believe there
exists a much finer and higher

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in frequency light than
the more material light.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes referred to
collectively as Light

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
with a capital L,
this is thought

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
of as a higher-dimensional
energy within visible light.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:10%
>>CLARE: Etheric energy refers
to this type of fine matter

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:10%
or light substance
that is all around us

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:10%
and permeates all
physical matter.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the same energy called
chi, vital force, prana,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and other names in
various languages.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Natural etheric
energy is cosmic or biological

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.780 align:middle line:84%
in origin, both derived
from a higher dimension.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The center of stars,
including our own sun,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
are considered dimensional
windows through which

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
physical and non-physical
energy and light enters

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:90%
our local universe.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: The moon
modulates and reflects

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
what it receives from the sun.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, both the
sun and moon are

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's nearest cosmic
sources of etheric energy.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: It accompanies
sunlight and moonlight,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and enters into the
atmosphere as water vapor

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
before condensing
as morning dew.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It is harder for us to perceive
higher vibrational energies

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
because of our own relatively
low vibrational perception.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Our culture conditions us to be
more adept at perceiving matter

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and slower energies than
pure high vibration.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Still, human
beings are hardwired

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to take in and use subtle and
spiritual energies, as well

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:90%
as the more physical ones.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Yet most people do it largely
without even knowing it.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Doing so feeds our light bodies.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Artists believe
these energies can bypass

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind, and
we can connect with them

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously via images.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Mystically speaking,
the purpose of these light rays

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
is to polish the mirror of our
heart, which Islam teaches is

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.940 align:middle line:90%
the throne of God.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: This prepares us to
connect with the Divine Image.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: In William's
feature presentation,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
he will show us how artists from
the ancient to the modern world

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.995 align:middle line:84%
portrayed the manifestation
of this divine light.

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM: Egypt's
famed 18th dynasty

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
was a time of magic
and mystery that

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
gave us some of history's
greatest purveyors of Arcanum.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Hatshepsut, the star
child who became a pharaoh

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and married a commoner
who discovered

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of transfiguration.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Thutmosis III, the
so-called Napoleon

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, who the Rosicrucians
claim as their founder,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and the producer of a
mystical white power of gold

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that fed the light
bodies of the pharaohs.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
In circa 1350 BC, the 18th
dynasty and the Egyptian empire

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
was at the height of
its accomplishment.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
A mystic and visionary
pharaoh named

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Amenophis IV came to the throne.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And he promptly launched a
religious revolution in Egypt,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
shaking to its core a religion
that had a 3,000-year history.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
He began his rule by
forbidding worship

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
of all the Egyptian gods,
replacing the old gods

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
with the new religion of
the disk, called the Aton.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Amenophis IV changed
his name to Akhenaten,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
which means Living Spirit of
Aton, or The Shining Aton.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Aton was addressed by Akhenaten
in prayers such as the Great

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Hymn to the Aton, "O sole God,
beside whom there is none."

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
The Aton was symbolized by
the sun disk emanating rays.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.660 align:middle line:84%
However, the Aton
was not the sun.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
The Aton was the light
that illuminated the sun.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:84%
It was the universal
spiritual presence.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Contact with its light
brought about mystic rapture,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:10%
which is but another name for
the attainment of the rainbow

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:10%
body of light.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:10%
Key features of
Atonism included a ban

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:10%
on idols and other
images of the Aton,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
with the exception of
a rayed solar disk,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:10%
in which the rays,
commonly depicted

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:10%
ending in hands offering
the key of life,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:10%
appear to represent the
unseen spirit of Aton.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
In this limestone shrine from
the house of a high priest,

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
we see Akhenaten and Nefertiti
receiving the light rays

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:90%
from the Aton.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:10%
The royal couple are also
seen making offerings to--

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:10%
or receiving them
from-- the Aton.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:10%
New temples were constructed,
including the new capital

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:10%
at Amarna, in which the Aton was
worshipped in the open sunlight

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:10%
rather than in the
dark temple enclosures

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.640 align:middle line:10%
as the old gods had been.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.510 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian people were
to worship Akhenaten

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:10%
as the one and only
divine child of Aton,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:10%
and only Akhenaten and
Nefertiti could warship Aton.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
This increased the
power of the pharaoh,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
while diminishing that of
the local temples, the gods,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and their priests.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
His teaching focused on love,
intimacy, transcendence,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and nature.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten's religious
revolution--

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:10%
known as the Amarna
revolution, after the name

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:10%
of his new capital
city he constructed--

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:10%
was accompanied by
a revolution in art.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:10%
His reign yielded art
unlike any Egyptian art

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:10%
that came before or after.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:10%
It is so un-Egyptian that
it has been of interest

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:10%
to many Egyptologists, as
well as art historians.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.710 align:middle line:10%
The style he used
has been called

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:10%
both naturalistic
and expressionistic,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:10%
among other things.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.740 align:middle line:84%
It emphasizes androgyny, as
well as birth and rebirth.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:10%
The images of Akhenaten's
wife and equal, Nefertiti,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:10%
from this period are some of the
most iconic and striking works

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:10%
of art ever created
in ancient history.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten broke the
conventions of Egyptian art

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:10%
by showing himself in warm
family scenes with his wife

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:10%
and children, and
portraying himself

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:10%
and the rest of his royal
family in a much more

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:10%
human and naturalistic manner
than any of his predecessors

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:10%
had.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
What is immediately different
are the typically Amarnan

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
features-- the bellies, thighs,
egg-shaped heads and faces.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
This relief of a royal
couple in the Amarna style

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
has variously been described
as Akhenaten and Nefertiti,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Smenkhkare and
Meritaten, or even

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamen and his
wife, Ankhesenamun.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of one
of Akhenaten and Nefertiti's

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:90%
daughters.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
We see here-- perhaps better
than in any other examples--

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the greatly exaggerated skull,
which protrudes to the back.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a typically
Amarnan feature,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
in which children were perceived
as symbols of reincarnation.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
The egg shape of their
heads symbolized rebirth

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and the hatching of
new life in the Aton.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Their eyes are hollow
to receive glass inlays.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Then there are the enigmatic
colossal statues of Akhenaten

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:90%
from Karnak.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
His shocking and
androgynous appearance

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:84%
was particularly
prominent in art

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
from the early
part of his reign.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
One early statue portrays
the king in the nude,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
without any genitalia
of any kind,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with long arms and fingers,
rounded thighs and buttocks,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
a soft belly, and
enlarged breasts.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten is sometimes shown is
having a long, slender, almost

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:10%
serpentine neck; a long
face with a sharp chin;

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:10%
narrow, almond-shaped or
"cat" eyes; and full lips.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
These highly
exaggerated features

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:84%
have puzzled archaeologists
since Akhenaten was first

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
discovered in the
early 19th century.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And people have offered
many explanations

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:90%
as to why he looked this way.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Theories range from
Akhenaten being a woman,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
to a man suffering from
disfiguring diseases,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
to the wild claim that he was
an alien or an alien hybrid--

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:90%
hence his elongated head.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
A more down-to-earth
explanation posits

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that the elongated head
and headgear of Akhenaten

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:84%
was not meant to
cover alien origins,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but rather is symbolic
of his heightened

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
state of consciousness.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:10%
His headgear is similar to
the meaning of the yellow hat

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.815 align:middle line:10%
gear of the first
Dalai Lama, who

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:10%
is shown with activated Crown
Chakra, or the Yellow Hat.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:10%
This perspective is
supported by the fact

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:10%
that not all images of Akhenaten
were radical caricatures.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
In some examples, he is shown
as quite normal and indeed

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.890 align:middle line:90%
handsome.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:10%
Aton worship scenes
or altar pieces

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:10%
are probably the images
most strongly associated

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:10%
with the Amarna period.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
The disk worship
images were almost all

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:84%
created to the same
formula-- Akhenaten in front

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:84%
of an alter offering
something to the Aton,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
while Nefertiti stands behind
Akhenaten, and one or more

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
of their daughters
stands behind Nefertiti.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Both are seen breathing in
the rejuvenating ankh, or key

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Here we note that
Nefertiti wears

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:84%
a transparent, pleated
linen robe tied with a sash.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian symbolism,
this symbolizes

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
the afterlife garment of light.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So does this scene
indicate that Nefertiti

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
is weaving this garment or
sheath from strands of light

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
from the Aton?

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:84%
By means of theurgical rights,
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:84%
breathe in the divine,
illuminating fire-- the Aton--

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and incorporate divinity
into their own being.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Theurgy relates to the
Greek word theourgia,

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
which refers to a
drawing in or a drawing

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:90%
down of a divine force.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The result is the
illumination and deification

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
of the participants.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
By means of theurgical rights,
Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:84%
breathe in the divine,
illuminating fire of the Aton,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and incorporate this divinity
into their own being.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The initiate would draw
in the rays of the sun,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
inhaling the flowering flames
that come down from the Aton.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Following the rites
of purification,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the theurgist elevates his
souls on the rays of the sun.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Contact with its light
brought about mystic rapture,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
which is another
name for attainment

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow body of light.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Here we see Nefertiti
and a princess

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
in transparent
garments that could

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:90%
match the rainbow body of light.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:10%
Although idols were banned
even in people's homes,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:10%
these were typically replaced
by functionally equivalent

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:10%
representations of Akhenaten and
his family venerating the Aton,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:10%
and receiving the ankh-- the
breath of life-- from it.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Regarding the key of life,
it's intriguing to point out

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:10%
a bit of word play.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:10%
The word Aton could be
pronounced "a-tone,"

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:10%
suggesting and anointing
by a tone or a vibration.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
The radiant Aton disk and
the healing hands of light

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
are even found on
Akhenaten's sarcophagus.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
It has a giant Aton disk
on the center of each side.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The dazzling or gleaming beams
of Aton, God's divine light,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.050 align:middle line:84%
were perceived in everything
in Akhenaten's religion.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Light meant love and
spiritual consciousness.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we may think of
the Aton as light love.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
There are four ways
to experience love,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:90%
wrote Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You can eat it, drink
it, breathe, and live it.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Those who eat love live in
the passions and the lower

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:90%
pleasures.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
They are never
satisfied, because they

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:90%
remain on the physical plane.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Those who drink love are
somewhat more refined.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But they're still in the astral
enjoyments and satisfactions.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:90%
One can also breathe love.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Certain philosophers--
including Akhenaten-- writers,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and artists breathe it
through their thoughts

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:90%
on the mental plane.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%
But they are rare.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And for those who live in
the subtle in their aspects

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of love, they experience
it as light in the spirit,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
as warmth in their
hearts, and they

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
can spread that light and
warmth on all those around them.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
He who lives this kind
of love find fulfillment.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the sun emits or
rains a key of life upon Earth

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.430 align:middle line:84%
is actually based
on solid science.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
The sun is like a giant
musical instrument.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The entire sun vibrates
from a complex pattern

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:90%
of acoustical waves.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It rings like a bell and
vibrates like an organ pipe.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The National Optical
Astronomy Observatory

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.440 align:middle line:84%
says we can learn a lot
by listening to the sun.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the sun has 10
million keys or notes.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
This National Optical
Astronomy Observatory image

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
from an article on solar
music shows the pattern

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
of the up and down movement from
a single solar musical note.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:90%
Red is up.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Blue is down.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a National Optical
Astronomy Observatory image

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of the actual solar surface
showing the up and down pattern

00:13:55.530 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of all 10 million solar musical
notes, played all at once.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And here's an image of the
keyboard of solar music.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a way for astronomers to
sort out and look at all 10

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:84%
million notes of the
solar music at once.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:84%
The visual similarity to
the ancient Egyptian images

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
of the rays of the Aton
may not be coincidental.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Shown here is one of the most
famous images for the Amarna

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It is now housed in the
Neues Museum in Berlin.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
The Aton is beaming ankhs
to the noses of Akhenaten

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and Nefertiti and three
of their six daughters.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This must be a
fairly early image.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
The three children
are Meritaten,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:84%
being kissed by
Akhenaten, Meketaten,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.300 align:middle line:84%
sitting on Nefertiti's lap,
and Ankhesenpaaten, the baby,

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%
on Nefertiti's shoulder.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten and Nefertiti are
seen inhaling the key of life

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:90%
from the Aton.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Taking the wordplay, one
wonders if the key of life

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is literally a key tone or
vibration from the Aton,

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
or a tone disk that makes
one at one with the cosmos.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Some propose that Akhenaten
is kissing his daughter.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
On closer inspection,
something far more mystical

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:90%
may be taking place.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
He appears, rather, to be
breathing the key of life

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
into the nostrils
of his daughter.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
This was duplicated in
the later Jewish account

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of the creation of man.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Then the Lord God formed man
of the dust of the ground,

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life,

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and man became a living being.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
The key to the
Arcanum in this scene

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.480 align:middle line:84%
is Akhenaten's daughter, who
points to the Egyptian glyph

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:90%
or hieroglyph "mist."

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This glyph resembles a threefold
fall of radiating water.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It means celestial
tears, or dew.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It portrays drops of
water raining or radiating

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:90%
from heaven.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The same hieroglyphic also
means instruction or teaching.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
As 1 Corinthians 15:47
says, the first man

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:90%
was of the dust of the earth.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
The second man is of heaven.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that this scene
is an atunement or atonement,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
in which Akhenaten
transmits the key of life

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to his daughter that enables
her to weave her light body

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and become at one
with the universe?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:84%
As explored in the
transfiguration episode,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
the same three-ray glyph
appears in renderings

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of the baptism of Jesus.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It also appears in the
transfiguration of Jesus,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:90%
in which he turns to light.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian three-rayed
symbol morphed

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
into all three-rayed
symbols which

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
represent initiation,
or instruction.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:10%
For example, the triple dot
symbol of the Chintamani

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:10%
appears on Jesus' robe.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It also appears on
the book he is holding

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:84%
in this sixth century
icon from Mount Sinai.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
A variation of this
three-ray symbol

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.380 align:middle line:84%
also appears in the Tibetan
Great Perfection teaching,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
which is symbolized by the
three-rayed wheel of joy.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So let us now take a closer
look at the Aton disk.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
We can see that a
Uraeus serpent is

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
seen protruding from the disk.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
An ankh, or key of life,
hangs from its neck.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
The depiction of the Uraeus
became very prominent

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
during the reign of Akhenaten,
indicating his strong belief

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that the Uraeus not only
protected the royal couple,

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
but also guided him in the
formation of his new theology

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and religious iconography.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.810 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism matches that of
the Ouroboros, a symbol that

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
was first introduced
during the Amarna period.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:10%
The Ouroboros, or the
symbol of the eternal round,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:10%
was later adopted as a symbol
for alchemy, or the Arcanum.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The word "ouroboros" originates
from the Greek language,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
"ouro" meaning tail and
"boros" meaning eating.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Thus, he who eats the tail.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The Ouroboros represents
the perpetual cyclic renewal

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of life and infinity,
the concept of eternity,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and the eternal return,
and represents the cycle

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of life, death, and rebirth
leading to immortality, as

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:90%
in the phoenix.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
The first recorded
appearance of this symbol

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
is on the enigmatic Book
of the Netherworld found

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
on the gilded shrine
of Tutankhamen,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:90%
the son of Akhenaten.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Both the head and feet of
Tutankhamen, as seen here,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
are surrounded by an
Ouroboros serpent that

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
is designated as
Mehen, the enveloper.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, symbolists
trace the origin of this symbol

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to the Milky Way galaxy,
which our ancestors knew

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
as the serpent of light.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The mouth of the serpent is
the center of the galaxy.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that instead
of being the disc of the sun,

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
the Aton disk is the galactic
disk of the Milky Way?

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Are the arms extending
from the Aton disk

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
the arms of the
Milky Way galaxy?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:84%
If so, is the love light of
Aton the etheric energies out

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:84%
of which the Milky Way
emerge, and holds it together?

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way was seen as
a water way in the heavens,

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and sailed upon by both
the sun deity and the moon,

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
leading the ancient
Egyptians to describe it

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:90%
as the Nile in the Sky.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Here, Shu holds the sky goddess,
Nut, over the earth god, Geb,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by gods
of the Ennead.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The location of the
Milky Way center,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and the location of the womb
on the female goddess Nut

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:90%
is concordant.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians must have
known about the Milky

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Way is what we are to
understand from this.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
In this painted wood
stele of Lady Taperet

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:84%
from the 22nd dynasty,
now in the Louvre,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
we see Taperet praying
before the god Aton,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:84%
with the sky goddess,
Nut, the Milky Way, above.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Could Akhenaten have been
intuiting that the Milky Way is

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
the light that
illuminates the sun?

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Is the Milky Way the
key to illuminating

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:90%
the mysteries of the Aton?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
As we have noted,
Akhenaten was part

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
of the 18th dynasty
of ancient Egypt.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
His reign transpired
a generation or two

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
after the reign of
Hatshepsut, Thutmosis III,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and the exodus of the Hebrews.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Thutmosis IV was the
grandfather of Akhenaten.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
during his reign

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that we begin to see
references to the Aton.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
When we look into the
history of Thutmosis IV's

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.460 align:middle line:84%
era, particularly that
of his niece Hatshepsut,

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
we find more Milky Way
and serpent symbolism.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:56.886 align:middle line:84%
This is Deir el Bahari, the
mortuary temple of Hatshepsut,

00:20:56.886 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:84%
which is known as
one of the most

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:90%
modern-looking Egyptian temples.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Of interest to us is the
chapel of the goddess

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Hathor, the goddess
of love and joy,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
on the left-hand
side of the temple.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Egypt revered Mother
Hathor as the heavenly cow

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
whose udder produced
the Milky Way,

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and whose body was the stars.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The maternal waters
of the Milky Way

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
were comparable to
a mother's milk.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Thus came the cow
symbolism for Hathor.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:10%
As a celestial cow,
Hathor is portrayed

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:10%
with stars on her body.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.780 align:middle line:10%
And when we see an image
such as this from Abu Simbel,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:10%
we are to understand that this
is Hathor, and interchangeably,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:10%
the Milky Way.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:10%
Returning to Deir el Bahari,
when we see Hatshepsut suckling

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:10%
the cow, we are encouraged
to see Hatshepsut receiving

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:10%
a life-giving cosmic
substance from the Milky Way.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Could this be another
way of showing

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the etheric energies
of the Milky Way?

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Today, we probe the Milky Way's
center with x-ray telescopes.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Did the ancients explore
this area with their minds?

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Etched on the columns
of the Hathor chapel

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of a serpent
with the Ankh, or key of life,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.080 align:middle line:90%
dangling from it.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the primal
snake, called the Wadjet,

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
the protector of Egypt.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
An interpretation
of the Milky Way

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
was that it was the
primal snake, Wadjet,

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:90%
the protector of Egypt.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It is fascinating to
note that the Wadjet

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.840 align:middle line:84%
serpent and the dangling key
of life is seen from the face

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
on on the Aton disk.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
This returns us to the
idea that the 18th dynasty

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
viewed the Milky Way as a
source of life-giving energies

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and protection.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to see how
they might have coiled

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
the serpent around to form the
Ouroboros symbol for the Milky

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Way.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
After Akhenaten's death, the
last king of the 18th dynasty

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:90%
took the throne of Egypt.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
This was Akhenaten's
son, Tutankhamen.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
He was born Tutankhaten, but his
name was changed to Tutankhamen

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.440 align:middle line:84%
to reflect his role
as the balancer

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
of the old-time
religion of Amun.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Amun was the name of the ancient
god overturned by Akhenaten,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and it is therefore thought
that Tutankhamen's name change

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.490 align:middle line:84%
represents a restoration
of the old gods

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.490 align:middle line:84%
after the death of
the heretic pharaoh.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
After Tut's reign, all
references to the 18th dynasty

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
were erased from
Egyptian history.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:84%
The Aton religion of
the disk became heresy.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The secrets of Akhenaten
and the love light

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:84%
effectively disappeared
for nearly 1,300 years,

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.510 align:middle line:84%
until it was resurrected
in the third century BC

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
by a group of Jewish mystics
known as the Essenes.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Their intention was to prepare
their bodies as a vessel

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
to hold these higher
vibrational energies,

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
draw them down, and create
a community of angels.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Clare will trace the history
of the Essenes' force

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:10%
in this segment of
"Beyond the Veil."

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CLARE: Akhenaten's
emphasis on light

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is one fingerprint that has
led researchers such as Robert

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Feather, author of The
Secret Initiation of Jesus

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:84%
at Qumran, to investigate
the connection

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:84%
between the teachings of
Jesus and the Qumran Essenes,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and the religion of the disk.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish historian
Josephus tells us

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes had
knowledge of divine things.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Philo calls the Therapeutes
citizens of heaven,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and says they seek a
divine illumination,

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
an alliance with
the upper world.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a generation
of scholars

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes of Qumran
and their writings,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Sea Scrolls, believe
that the Essenes discovered

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the Torch of Illumination that
the followers of Akhenaten

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:90%
hid after his reign.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
With this in mind, it is
fascinating to compare

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Christian art
portraying the Pentacost

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:90%
with the art of Amarna.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Pentecost occurred 50 days
after Jesus' ascension.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.240 align:middle line:84%
It celebrates the descent of the
Holy Spirit upon the disciples.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:10%
Jesus appeared to the
disciples and attuned them

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:10%
with the rays of
the Holy Spirit.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:10%
According to the Acts of the
Apostles in the New Testament,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
when the days of Pentecost
were accomplished,

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:10%
the disciples were all
together in one place.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there
came a sound from heaven

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:90%
as of a mighty wind coming.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And it filled the whole house
where they were sitting.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:10%
And there appeared to them
parted tongues, as it were,

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.790 align:middle line:10%
of fire, and it sat
upon every one of them.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:10%
And they were filled
with the Holy Spirit.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And they began to speak
with diverse tongues.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
In the images of
Pentecost, the Holy Spirit

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.990 align:middle line:90%
emerges from the cosmic realms.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It sprays rays of
light virtually

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
identical to the
rays of the Aton.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Is this a coincidence?

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Or does it uphold a connection
between the Essenes,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:90%
the religion of the disk?

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Does this art
portray the Essenes

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.515 align:middle line:90%
in the arms of the Holy Light?

00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:10%
In linguistics, the letters
D and T are interchangeable.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:10%
Vowels, too.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:10%
By this accepted practice,
we see the word "aton"

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:10%
easily morphing into "adon,"
the name or title of Jesus,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:10%
meaning lord.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.750 align:middle line:10%
The interesting
connection here is

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:10%
that when Jesus transmitted the
Holy Spirit to the disciples,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:10%
he did so by breathing on them.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, Akhenaten inhaled
the key of life from the Aton,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and breathed it
upon his daughter.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:84%
What if it was not just breath
that he used, but sound?

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.974 align:middle line:84%
A key that he
breathed upon them?

00:27:41.974 --> 00:27:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Sound is a building
block of creation.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The Bible says, in the
beginning was the word, a sound.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Could sound have
created life on earth?

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.030 align:middle line:10%
Diverse spiritual
traditions consider

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:10%
chanting a route to
spiritual development.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.550 align:middle line:10%
The ancients believed
that stilling the mind

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:16.130 align:middle line:10%
created a state of calmness,
enabling meditation to begin.

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:10%
This resulted in
deep connections

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:10%
to other dimensional
frequencies, or other worlds.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.025 align:middle line:10%
Was this what the disciples
of Jesus and Akhenaten

00:28:27.025 --> 00:28:30.395 align:middle line:10%
were portrayed doing
in these images?

00:28:30.395 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:10%


00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:10%
Just as Akhenaten received
the holy love light of Aton,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:10%
so, too, did the disciples
gathered in the upper room

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:10%
as it was transmitted from
the resurrected Jesus.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:10%
Mystical, supernatural,
and cosmic-- words

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.360 align:middle line:10%
hardly convey this experience.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Christian art shows the
tongues of fire entering

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:10%
the crowns of the
disciples who have

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.460 align:middle line:10%
gathered in the upper room.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:10%
The flames symbolize their
crown chakra illumination.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.180 align:middle line:10%
Was it some form
of galactic rain

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.113 align:middle line:10%
that the awakened and
pure-hearted could experience?

00:29:18.113 --> 00:29:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
As one of his tours
of Egypt, William

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and his group where in the
Sekhmet chapel at Karnak.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
A tour member took
this remarkable photo

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
of what some would
interpret as a light being.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The figure's hands
are strikingly

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.325 align:middle line:84%
similar to the way
of the hands of Aton

00:29:42.325 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:90%
were portrayed in Amarna art.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Pentacost marks the birth
of the Christian Church.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
The Acts of the Apostles
reveal Mary as one

00:29:54.730 --> 00:30:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of those taking part in the
preparation for Pentacost.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:84%
At the Annunciation,
Mary had experienced

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:90%
the descent of the Holy Spirit.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:84%
In Luke 1, verse 35, the angel
Gabriel had said to Mary,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
"The Holy Spirit
will come upon you,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and the power of the Most
High will overshadow you.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the child to be born
will be called the Son of God."

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Through the spirit's
coming down upon her,

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:10%
Mary was associated in a unique
way with the mystery of Christ.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.810 align:middle line:10%
The technique is as follows.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.290 align:middle line:10%
People assemble, seated
in chairs arranged

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:10%
in a circle around a table with
a cross and a statue of Jesus

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:10%
on it.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.750 align:middle line:84%
They place their hands
on their laps, palms up.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
A prayer is said to God,
and music is then played.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Spirit will come into
the hearts of the faithful.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:10%
Here, Mary appears
as a ringleader

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:10%
of a circle of star
pupils of Jesus.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Notice the flame
emerging from her head.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.803 align:middle line:84%
Does this signify
awakened consciousness?

00:31:26.803 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We see the heavens
open as indicated

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:39.350 align:middle line:84%
by the almond-shaped mandula
of light surrounded by angels.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:43.700 align:middle line:10%
Above the angels, we
see Jesus, the source

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:10%
of this profound
transformative light.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.830 align:middle line:10%
We see this ceremony repeated
in art of the Pentacost,

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:10%
with Mary at the center of
the circle of initiates,

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:10%
a circle of star
beings in the making.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:10%
Researchers into
the Essenes believe

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:10%
that Mary was trained
at the Essene community

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:10%
at Mount Carmel.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
If so, she would have
learned the Essene practices

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of chanting, praying, and
bodily purification that

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.105 align:middle line:84%
prepared the body to receive
the higher vibrational Christ

00:32:26.105 --> 00:32:26.605 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:32:26.605 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:10%
In the episode, "Van Eyck
and the Lamb of God,"

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:10%
we note how the mystical and
alchemical Van Eyck attempted

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:10%
to portray the otherworldly
light of heaven.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:10%
There is no sunlight
in this setting.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the light of the Holy
Spirit descends like a dove

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and illuminates the
scene with a divine glow.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.210 align:middle line:84%
As John said in
John 1, verse 32,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
"I saw the spirit descending
from heaven like a dove."

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We may now appreciate
that it is strikingly

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:14.800 align:middle line:84%
similar to the rays of
the Aton in both design

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and meaning to the artists.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Van Eyck intended
for this painting

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to be a meditative
aid, and for the viewer

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to actually participate
in the proceedings.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten intended the images
of his family communing

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:10%
with the Aton to serve
the same purpose.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:10%
Could it be that these
mystics and artists believed

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.210 align:middle line:10%
that a holy light
could be assessed

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:10%
through art and symbols?

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:10%
It appears so.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:10%
At the baptism of
Jesus, the Holy Spirit

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:10%
descended to earth via a
hole or opening in heaven.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.310 align:middle line:10%
It was transmitted
via the breath.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:10%
The heavens were opened,
and he saw the Holy Spirit

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.100 align:middle line:10%
in the shape of a dove,
descending and entering

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:10%
into him.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:10%
And a voice from heaven said,
thou art my beloved Son.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.679 align:middle line:10%
I have this day begotten thee.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:35.969 align:middle line:84%
And straight away, a great
light shown around the place.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:10%
And John fell down before him,
and said, "I pray thee, Lord,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.489 align:middle line:10%
baptize thou me."

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.400 align:middle line:10%
The baptism of
Jesus elevated him

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:10%
to the state of nazara--
truth, Christ consciousness.

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:02.810 align:middle line:10%
Hence, he received
the beaming garment.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:10%
How did John transmit
this garment?

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
He tore open the heavens and
brought a mysterious vibration,

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit,
symbolized by a dove,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.730 align:middle line:90%
into the consciousness of Jesus.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:10%
This vibration sealed
Jesus' body of flesh.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:10%
Many wonder why the Holy Spirit
came in the form of a dove

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.040 align:middle line:10%
upon Jesus.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:39.300 align:middle line:10%
The reason is explained in the
Old Testament and Jewish belief

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.520 align:middle line:10%
in Genesis 1, verse 2.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:10%
The life-giving spirit
is then compared

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:49.480 align:middle line:10%
to the bird hovering
over the water.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Jewish rabbis consider
this bird as a dove,

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
as it was a dove that
brought the message of peace

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to righteous Noah's
ark after the flood.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 8, verse 8 has noted it
was accompanied by a rainbow,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.545 align:middle line:90%
linking the two symbols.

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:12.090 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.066 align:middle line:84%
Doves appear in
the New Testament

00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
at scenes associated with
Jesus' birth, baptism,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:90%
and just before his death.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Before the cross
gained prominence

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.605 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth century,
the second-century church

00:36:28.605 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
of Father Clement of Alexandria
urged early Christians

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to use the dove or fish as a
symbol to identify themselves

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and each other as
followers of Jesus.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.930 align:middle line:10%
The dove has a cosmic meaning.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:10%
If we think of John
instructing Jesus

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:10%
in some form of
stellar knowledge,

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:10%
it opens us to the
possibility that he

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.845 align:middle line:10%
was infusing Jesus'
consciousness with the light

00:37:04.845 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:10%
of certain stars
or star systems.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.860 align:middle line:84%
In particular, following
the flight of the dove

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:19.580 align:middle line:84%
will lead us to the Mother
Hathor, the Milky Way.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning," says
Genesis 1, verse 1 and 2,

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.872 align:middle line:84%
"God created the
heavens and the earth.

00:37:29.872 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The earth was without
form and void,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and darkness was on
the face of the deep."

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit of
God was hovering over

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
the face of the waters
like a dove, which

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:84%
spreads her wings
over her young,

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.910 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Babylonian Talmud.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:84%
If we think of the
galaxy as a dove,

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.260 align:middle line:84%
or as a great mother
bird, hovering

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:84%
on the waters of
the cosmic ocean,

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.200 align:middle line:84%
we readily recognize that her
young are the stars and planets

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:84%
within her body, including
Sol, or Sun, and Earth.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.740 align:middle line:84%
In NASA imagery, we see the
Milky Way from the side.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The center of the galaxy
forms the body of the bird,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.600 align:middle line:84%
while the spiral
arms of the galaxy

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.310 align:middle line:90%
are her outstretched wings.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Further pushing
this thought stream

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is the etymology of Jordan,
the river of baptism.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.300 align:middle line:84%
It is traced to the
Babylonian Aradonis,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.520 align:middle line:84%
meaning "river of
life," the Milky Way.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians considered
the life-giving and supporting

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Nile, and its course
from South to North,

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:84%
as a reflection of the course
of the Milky Way in the sky,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:84%
proving the hermetic adage
"as above, so below."

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there a serpentine
energy, or vibration,

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:84%
or sound, flowing or raining
from the center of the galaxy?

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Scion, that awakens latent
capabilities within us?

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Modern radio astronomy
seems to think so.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the discovery
of cosmic radio waves

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
center of the galaxy

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:84%
led to the creation
of radio astronomy

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and breathtaking discoveries
about the galactic core.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:00.270 align:middle line:84%
In 1932, Karl Jansky, a
Bell Telephone Laboratories

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
engineer, was investigating
sources of interference

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to recently opened transatlantic
short wave radio telephone

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:90%
circuits.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.790 align:middle line:84%
To find the source of this pesky
hissing noise, as he put it--

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
To find the source of this pesky
hissing noise, as he put it,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
he built the first 95-foot
movable radio telescope

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.040 align:middle line:90%
to detect it.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
This large, rod-like
antennae, which

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.560 align:middle line:84%
resembled a box kite
lying on its side,

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.950 align:middle line:84%
swivelled on a circular track
supported by Ford Model T

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.450 align:middle line:90%
tires.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
While two clear,
immediate suspects

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.650 align:middle line:84%
were local and
distant thunderstorms,

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:51.920 align:middle line:84%
a third was a steady
hiss of unknown origin

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that appeared daily at the
same time and same location.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Noise always
increased when Jansky

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:90%
pointed his rod at the stars.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:84%
By using a star
map, he discovered

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:84%
that the waves came from the
center of our Milky Way galaxy,

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:90%
at 26 degrees of Sagittarius.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:84%
What lurks at the
center of our galaxy

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that produced the hiss
that caught Jansky's ear?

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:84%
A galaxy spins like a
giant cosmic hurricane

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.070 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of thousands
of light-years

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
across, with an inner-eye
wall and calm eye,

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
a super-cooled,
massive black hole.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
As worlds of matter get
sucked into these black holes,

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:84%
some of this matter gets
ejected and accelerated

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:58.040 align:middle line:84%
to very high speeds out of
the center of the galaxy,

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.830 align:middle line:84%
creating highly excited beams
of invisible energy, millions

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.070 align:middle line:90%
of light-years in length.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
All this friction creates
lots of hissing radio noise.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Could this hissing of the
core of our galactic serpent

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:20.900 align:middle line:90%
be the Aton?

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Did the Essene mystic
John the Baptist

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:30.690 align:middle line:10%
initiate Jesus in the Holy
Light of the Milky Way, as well?

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Did Jesus then
transmit this light

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.215 align:middle line:84%
to his mother in the Coronation,
and later, at Pentecost?

00:42:38.215 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Could modern science
be on the verge

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of discovering the
source of the Holy Light

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.760 align:middle line:90%
and the secrets of the Aton?

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:58.142 align:middle line:84%
Or is it that secret already
known by the powers that be?

00:42:58.142 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLIAM: I'm William Henry.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.680 align:middle line:84%
