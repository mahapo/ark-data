intelligences have played

explain the true nature of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%

>> In the new book,
"Origins of the Gods,"

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:10%
ancient history
researcher Andrew Collins,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:10%
along with co-author
Greg Little,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:10%
have presented a fascinating
look at the connection between

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:10%
human consciousness and
otherworldly intelligences.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Drawing on hundreds of
thousands of years of history

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and the latest understandings
of quantum science,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
they suggest that
many UFOs are actually

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
transdimensional
intelligences that

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
manifest in plasma environments
and communicate with contactees

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:90%
through quantum entanglement.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And the authors posit
this has been going on

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:90%
since prehistoric times.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Ever since humanity arose in
Africa as much as two million

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:10%
years ago, I suspect that
we have been influenced

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:10%
by transdimensional
intelligences.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the true source
of the ancient aliens

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and that those ancient
aliens may not simply

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:90%
have come from other planets.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
They may have come from a
realm coexisting with us

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
outside of normal physical
reality, which in string theory

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:90%
is referred to as the bulk.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:10%
They have been drip feeding us
knowledge, wisdom, innovations,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:10%
and technologies
that has allowed

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the rise of civilization.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers suggest that
there are certain places around

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:10%
the globe that have been
particularly conducive

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:10%
to the appearance of these
transdimensional intelligences

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.700 align:middle line:10%
often perceived as
lights and UFOs.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Encounters with UFOs are
more common in certain areas

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of the globe than others.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And these are generally
places of intense geology;

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:10%
places that have
prominent fault line

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:10%
areas of particular minerals,
such as quartz or tourmaline,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:10%
which when put under pressure,
release electrons and create

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:10%
electricity.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:10%
And I think that these
lights have been there

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:10%
for hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:10%
if not millions of years,
and that the ancients were

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:10%
very much aware of the science.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:10%
>> One such important ancient
site is the Qesem Cave

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:10%
in Israel.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:10%
It was in this
400,000 year old cave

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:10%
that archeologists found
some of the earliest

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:10%
evidence of shamanism in the
form of various artifacts

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:10%
believed to be used to
enter into communion

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:10%
with otherworldly beings.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> These very same people as
early as 400,000 years ago were

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
developing a number of
innovations that were the first

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
for humanity.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence that as all
this was happening these people

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
were virtually writing
the book on shamanism?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
What I suspect the two are
linked, the first of shamanism

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and these innovations and
technologies, the advancements

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:90%
go hand in hand.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Another fascinating link
made by Collins is that

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:10%
to a mountain close
to the Qesem Cave.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mount Garrison was
very important to the earliest

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Israelites to enter
into the promised land.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So the patriarchs
and the prophets

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
all were associated
with this mountain.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:90%
This was the mountain of God.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%
This was his dwelling point.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It is said within the
literature of the people

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that have lived on or by Mount
Garrison for thousands of years

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and who are known
today as the Samaritans

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that God appears there in
his form as the Shekhinah

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:84%
as manifestations of
light, what we today

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:90%
would refer to as UFOs.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We find that there is a very
intense geology associated

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:90%
with Mount Garrison.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Directly beneath it are a number
of prominent faults or fault

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of pressure
that put on those, I suspect

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
is creating the right electronic
or electromagnetic environments

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to generate these UFOs
that will appear there.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:10%
>> To Andrew and his colleagues,
these connections are more than

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:10%
just coincidences.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They are testament to the
interconnection between humans

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:90%
and otherworldly beings.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
One that has since
prehistoric times

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
shaped the course
of our evolution.
