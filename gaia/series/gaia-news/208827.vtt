>> A full planetary
parade, a Cancer solstice,

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and the perfect time for you
to expand your potential,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.710 align:middle line:84%
how you can prepare to get
the most out of this rare

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.550 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.745 align:middle line:84%
>> This solstice is a key matter
to align our lives and let go

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:19.254 align:middle line:90%
of whatever is not aligned.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.815 align:middle line:90%

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.310 align:middle line:84%
On June 21, the
Northern hemisphere

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
will see the most light
while the Southern hemisphere

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
will be at its darkest.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
If we look through a
telescope that night,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to
see all the planets

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.670 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system
lining up with the moon

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:90%
in between Mars and Jupiter.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But starting June
24, the moon will

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
be in the constellation of
Taurus between Mars and Venus,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and will be the most beautiful
day to look at the sky.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:10%
How will this celestial
event impact our lives?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer Mercedes
Arnus Arraut.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:10%
>> So equinoxes and solstices
divide the zodiac wheel

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:10%
into four points, which are the
zero degrees of Aries, Cancer,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:10%
Libra, and Capricorn.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And when the sun enters any
of these four constellations

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:10%
is when we have an equinox
or when we have a solstice,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:10%
bringing in a new season.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's why these
four zodiac signs

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:10%
are called cardinal signs.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
It's cardinal energy, bringing
something new, activating areas

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:90%
in our life that needed action.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the constellation
that we're talking about

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:90%
is Cancer.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is the energy of home.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Cancer season starts with
this solstice on June 21.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Cancer talks about home, safety,
family, stability, protection,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:90%
nurture, what's familiar to us.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It's our emotions.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So in the upcoming
three months, we

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
can experience a review
of all these matters,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
since Cancer solstice
this year takes place

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:90%
under a very dynamic energy.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we expect Jupiter
to bring in as a key figure

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:90%
in this solstice?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see that in the
upcoming three months,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
we can be changing homes.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We can be dealing with
important family matters,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
or in looking to
make investments

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
into an important
property or project

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:90%
that we want to nurture.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So since Jupiter, the planet of
the foreign lands, the planet

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
of expansion is a very key
figure in the solstice,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.700 align:middle line:84%
we can be looking
for a home abroad.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of people moving
or creating a home overseas,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
for example, or in other states.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
As well as we can be making
investments in places

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that are foreign to us, and
definitely lots of traveling.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What can those of us who
are uncertain about letting go

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of what isn't serving us do
to align our lives in the next

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:90%
three months?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> For this solstice, we have
a full planetary alignment,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which is something very rare,
indicating that this solstice

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
is a key matter to align our
life and let go of whatever is

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:90%
not aligned.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we do this act of
aligning ourselves consciously,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the next three months will go a
lot smoother than if we don't.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But for sure, we can
experience many changes

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
in everything that was
giving us stability

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of action and
movement when it comes to,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:90%
what is home to us?

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Although Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and Uranus will align during
this year's summer solstice,

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Mercedes says the energy will
last for about three months

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:90%
after the conjunction.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So be sure to embrace
this time of action

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to light a fire in your life
and expand your horizon.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:10%
