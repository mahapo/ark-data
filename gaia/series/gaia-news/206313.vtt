>> The Secretary of
Defense makes a secret,

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.640 align:middle line:10%
unannounced trip to Area 52, but
our inside sources say he also

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.430 align:middle line:10%
visited the infamous Area 51.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:90%
What was he doing there?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.390 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
Secretary of Defense,
Lloyd Austin,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:10%
made an unannounced trip to the
secretive Tonopah test range

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
airport, also known as Area 52.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
This base is about 55 miles
away from Groom Lake, what

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
most people know as Area 51.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Tonopah has a history
of black ops aircraft

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
support and testing, including
the F-117 A Nighthawk

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%
stealth fighter.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And during the time of
the secretary's visit,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:84%
the US military was
conducting red flag exercises,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
aerial war games meant to
test pilots and aircraft.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:10%
Secretary Austin was seemingly
there to observe these war

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
games, but retired US
Intelligence Officer, Rick

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.892 align:middle line:10%
Doty, has inside information.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>>RICK DOTY: Now, as I
understand, some of my sources

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:10%
tell me that he flew in, on
the Secretary of Defense plane

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:10%
into Tonopah, but he was
only there a couple of hours

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:10%
and then he went by
helicopter from Tonopah

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:10%
to Groom Lake, which
is about 55 miles away.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And what he did
over there, what he

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
saw over there,
what he was briefed

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.050 align:middle line:84%
on over there, who knows,
probably highly classified.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Even some of my inside
sources couldn't tell me

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
what he had access to or
what he was briefed on.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
The cover reason was
be briefed on red flag,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
because red flag was
occurring at Tonopah

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and then his
secretive mission was

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to be briefed on the
classified projects that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:90%
were occurring at Area 51.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:90%
That's my belief.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Cabinet members come and go
with different administrations.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
If Area 51 does hold
extraterrestrial technology,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
would the Secretary
of Defense have access

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%
to all the information?

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: I believe the
Secretary of Defense

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
might have access to
the knowledge of it,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
probably not all aspects
of it, just because we're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with exotic
technologies at Area 51,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning reverse engineering
of ET crafts or other ET

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
technologies, not
necessarily the craft.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the
energy devices that

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.280 align:middle line:84%
were in the craft,
the propulsion

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
systems that were in the craft.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I think he probably would
know or have access to that,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
but the details about exactly
what we were doing now,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that he would
have full access to that.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
>> After a career in the army,
then working for Raytheon,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and finally as
Secretary of Defense,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is it possible he was just
curious to see what they held

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DOTY: All the good stuff is
that Area 51 and locked away.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So, having access to probably
some of the secrets while he

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.450 align:middle line:84%
was Vice Chief of
Staff of the Army,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and then after he
retired in 2016,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
he was on the board of
Raytheon, and as I understand,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
he still had a
security clearance,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because you would have required
a security clearance working

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
for Raytheon.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And he probably
learned something

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:90%
from that, maybe even rumors.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, he had a chance to visit
Area 51, and as far as I know,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
this is the first time
he's ever been there.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
It's 55 miles away,
probably 40 minutes

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:90%
on a Black Hawk helicopter.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he spent a
couple of hours over there

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
before he returned
back to the Tonopah.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So, in two and 1/2
hours, he could

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:84%
have been briefed on many very,
very highly classified secrets

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%
in the black program.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:10%
>> We may never know exactly
what the Secretary of Defense

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:10%
knows, but it begs the question,
what new military technologies

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:10%
are they working on at
these clandestine sites?

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And did humans come up
with this technology

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:84%
ourselves or did we get
extraterrestrial help?

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:10%
