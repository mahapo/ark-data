is not only a way

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to understand where we
are in the universe.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:84%
For Gaiam TV's Regina
Meredith, astrology

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is providing new and
exciting insights

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.832 align:middle line:90%
on where the universe is headed.

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:19.540 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm not an astrologer,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:10%
but I've learned to have
some respect for the art.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
It started many years
ago when a friend

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:10%
of mine who was a high
profile astrologer said,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:10%
whenever things were falling
apart in my life and everyone

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:10%
around, watch out for
mercury in retrograde,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.262 align:middle line:10%
which is a time that you
don't want to make mistakes.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to sign
contracts because you're

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:10%
kind of stuck with them.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
Well, that is part of a
larger theme going on.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:10%
Carl, on YouTube, is telling us
that the next couple of months

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:10%
are going to be extremely
pressure-filled for all of us.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a period
of time he's never seen before,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and it happens to coincide with
what is being called "the birth

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:90%
canal of the Mayan calendar."

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:84%
The two are overlaying
each other perfectly.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of pressure, a
lot of change coming up,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's putting pressure on us
to make decisions at this time.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But because of the influences,
we can't make them emotionally.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We need to be very logical,
we need to be cool and clear,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and understand that
we're going to be

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:90%
living with it for a long time.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
The decisions we
make now are going

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:90%
to have permanent consequences.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:90%
So listen up to the astrology.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like it's time to
make really wise decisions.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:90%
