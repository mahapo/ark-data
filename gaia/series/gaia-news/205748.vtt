>> A shift in the moon's orbit
may lead to massive flooding

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.280 align:middle line:10%
in the future.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.660 align:middle line:84%
What's really going on with
the moon's upcoming wobble?

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
In a new report from the
NASA Sea Level Change science

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
team at the
University of Hawaii,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
scientists warn that an
upcoming natural phenomenon

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in the moon's orbit combined
with rising sea levels

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
could cause record flooding
along coastal regions.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:10%
NASA administrator Bill Nelson
said in a statement, quote,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:10%
"Low-lying areas near sea
level are increasingly at risk

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and suffering due to
the increased flooding,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and it will only get worse."

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
The moon affects tides
on Earth every day.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:90%
So why the cause for alarm now?

Astronomer and "Gaia News"
contributor Marc Dantonio.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Every 18.6 years the
moon reaches a point where

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610 align:middle line:10%
it's the highest
in its declination.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
where it's going to also

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
be above the Earth's equator,
when the moon is actually also

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
at a point where it's
closest to the Earth because

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:90%
of the elliptical orbit.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
If all those things
correspond and combine

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to be at one point
like this, then that

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is where the researcher says
at the University of Hawaii

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at
potential flooding.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The moon moves in
an elliptical orbit.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.220 align:middle line:10%
As it revolves around the Earth,
its angle changes in relation

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth's equator.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:10%
This is called its declination.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:10%
Every 18.6 years,
this declination

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
is at its highest point, called
a lunar standstill or wobble.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
When this happens,
high tides are higher,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and low tides are lower.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What it means is that every
18.6 years the moon reaches

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
a point in the sky where it's
an additional five degrees above

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
our Earth's tilt in the sky.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%
That puts it a major standstill.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And if that
corresponds to a point

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
when the moon is also
closest to the Earth,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
this researcher is
saying that this

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is when we can end up having
some very dangerous tides

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
and/or flooding on the planet.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers say the
combination of rising sea

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
levels and this natural
occurrence of higher tides due

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to the moon's orbit could
lead to massive flooding

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:84%
but won't be extreme
until the mid 2030s.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Should we hope for the
best or plan for the worst?

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:10%
>> We had one of the
standstills in 2015 actually.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall any
major problems there.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But 2016 had some record
flooding in the world.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But that was some distance away
from this standstill point.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:90%
So it remains to be seen.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
We've done this before,
had this before.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure that it's
going to really be the worst.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:90%
That's my only gripe with it.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there might be
flooding of a low-lying parking

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
lot at a business for
a period of some months

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
like every morning or every
afternoon or whatever.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, well, then that

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
could interrupt
business that way.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And that may happen.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.923 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think it's going
to be a catastrophic thing.

00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:10%
I think it's going
to come and go.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And people are going to go, was
something supposed to happen?

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:10%
