00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Investors in cryptocurrency
have grown by more than 300%

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.560 align:middle line:10%
in the last year alone.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650 align:middle line:84%
With the world coming out of
one of the most tumultuous times

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
in modern history, people are
flocking to digital assets.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.810 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Could investors have
found a key to unlocking

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the crypto
market by using sacred geometry?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Cryptocurrency, a
one-time novelty

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:10%
used by tech-savvy individuals
as a digital storehouse

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:10%
of wealth, is now being
adopted by some of the largest

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:10%
institutions around the world.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Cryptocurrency has
gone mainstream.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But with growing
demand comes the need

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to better understand
these new markets.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:10%
Some investors have found
the use of sacred geometry

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:10%
as a way to track the
trends of digital currency.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
Known as Fibonacci retracements,
this sacred geometric tool

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:84%
has been used to predict
potential support

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and resistance levels for price
actions in financial markets.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But what is sacred geometry,
and in particular, the Fibonacci

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
sequence?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:10%
Robert Grant, CEO and
founder of Crown Sterling,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:10%
is an expert on sacred geometry
and crypto coin creator.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.812 align:middle line:10%
>> Geometry in and of itself
is a language of the universe.

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:10%
It's the language
of consciousness.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:10%
It is the coherence of
consciousness itself.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Geometry ends up being that
which we start to perceive,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and it can take on the meaning
that we attach to it as well.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we start to
perceive in that geometry

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:84%
starts to manifest in the
realm-- in the world around us.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The Fibonacci sequence
is a series of--

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a natural number of progression
that builds upon itself.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's self-organized.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So you start with the
number 1, and then

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
you simply add
another 1 to that.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes 1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So then you take the
last two numbers,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and then that becomes 3.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So it goes 1, 1, 2, 3,
5, and then it becomes 8,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:90%
because 3 plus 5 equals 8.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes 13.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And then 21, 34,
55, 89, 144, 233.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can continue this exact
process all the way infinitely.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> When people apply these
geometric sequences to crypto

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.357 align:middle line:84%
market charts, they find
that certain patterns emerge.

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many people that
take an entirely different

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:10%
approach to investing decisions,
and they'll use Fibonacci

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:10%
analysis to try to predict
the harmonic of the next wave

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:10%
of whatever the
trend is going to be.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
We know, from analysis of
something called the Mandelbrot

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
set, this symbol and structure
of self-similarity that

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
continues to fractalize across
the universe at all scales--

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
when you think about
it in those terms,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
the Fibonacci
pattern is embedded

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
within this fractalization.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
case, then you should

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
be able to do predictive
analytics on taking a snapshot.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Would it not potentially also
occur in financial markets?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
most promising analyses

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
that I've been wanting
to look at and pursue

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:90%
for quite some time.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But if sacred geometry is
the language of consciousness,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
how can we know if
it's predictive,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
or informing the markets
through investor consciousness?

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the geometry, actually,
that's being put out there

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
somehow part of a collective
awareness that is then creating

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:90%
an outcome?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely an
uncanny relationship.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:90%
It's happened too many times.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that our
ability to perceive patterns

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is really another way of
looking at our own way of seeing

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the universe and
being able to measure

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:90%
our degree of intelligence.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Can the use of sacred
geometry to read the crypto

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
markets really give people a
leg up on knowing how certain

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
assets will trend?

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I do fundamentally believe
there is a frequency that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
the world can tap into, and
those that are able to perceive

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
it will do certain actions
based on those frequencies.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But to describe it and say it's
been scientifically referenced,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, would be a leap that
I'm not willing, yet, to make.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Though finding patterns
in the past is in no way

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
a guarantee for future success,
many have found the use

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry to read
the crypto markets financially

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
beneficial.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
With so much uncertainty, can
we use the universal patterns

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
found in geometry as a way
to make sense of the world?

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Either way there is no
denying that we are all

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
connected in a cosmic web.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And, as Robert Grant
says, those who

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
are able to perceive
these patterns

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:90%
can perceive the universe.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:10%
