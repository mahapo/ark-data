>> Celebrating 25 years of
rovers on Mars and looking

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.980 align:middle line:84%
forward to the next chapter
of Mars exploration,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
which may include excavating
deep into the red planet--

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.990 align:middle line:90%
this is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:10%
July 1997, NASA's
Mars Pathfinder

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.110 align:middle line:10%
landed on the red planet
and began its mission

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:10%
to demonstrate how a robotic
rover would land on the planet.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Using an innovative
design, the rover

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
landed on Mars with a parachute
and a series of giant air bags

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:90%
to cushion its blow.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:10%
The Carl Sagan Memorial
Station and the Sojourner Rover

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:10%
outlived their
projected lifespan,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:10%
and in the years following,
sent back to Earth

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:10%
magnificent images.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The lander returned more than
16,500 images and the rover

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
sent back 550, as well as
chemical analysis of rocks,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
soil, and data on
wind and weather.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:84%
The final transmission
from the Mars Pathfinder

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
was on September 27,
1997, but the data

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
it provided help
scientists to conclude Mars

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:90%
was once wet and warm.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:10%
And rounded rocks on
the surface indicate

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:10%
they may have been worn
down by running water.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:10%
And if there was water,
there could have been life.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:10%
Flash forward to today,
NASA's Perseverance Rover,

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
on the red planet
since February of 2021,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:10%
is tasked with finding
past or present life

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:10%
and seeing if humans could one
day explore or colonize Mars.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:10%
Perseverance is
collecting samples

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:10%
to determine if they contain
any fossils of ancient Martians.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But a new study, led by
Alexander Pavlov, a space

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:84%
scientist at NASA, says they
might have to dig a lot deeper.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Pavlov argues that amino acids
could be the best evidence

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of any past life on Mars.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:10%
But after millions of
years of radiation,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:10%
all those amino
acids on the surface

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:10%
would have been
destroyed, writing, quote,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:10%
"Our experimental
results suggest

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:10%
serious challenges for the
search of ancient amino acids

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:10%
and other potential organic
biosignatures in the top 2

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:10%
meters of the Martian surface,"
2 meters, or roughly 7 feet.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But Perseverance can
only dig a few inches.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:10%
However, Pavlov told
vicenews.com, quote,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:10%
"Microcraters are
common on Mars.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Small impactors
can excavate rocks

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:10%
from several meters of death.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Cosmic rays are significantly
reduced by 2-meter depth

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
into a rock and do not
penetrate at all below 4 meters.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, and ejecta
from such depths

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:10%
would have small exposure
time to cosmic rays, and thus

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:10%
may contain the primordial,
unaltered amino acids

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:10%
from billions of years ago."

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:10%
25 years of humans studying
the surface of Mars

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:10%
and we have learned so much.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:10%
But as Pavlov
concluded in his study,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:10%
we have only scratched the
surface of this problem.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But with every problem
comes the opportunity

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:90%
to figure out a solution.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps this will
help us find life on Mars.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
