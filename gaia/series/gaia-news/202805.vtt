>> The belief in oneness and its
connection towards the future

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.260 align:middle line:10%
of humanity, this is Gaia News.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.148 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
oneness, or the belief

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.150 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
connected, that everyone

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
is a part of a larger whole.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We may view
ourselves as separate

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:84%
but also realize
we are still part

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:84%
of some substance
of the universe

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
through element,
frequency, or vibration.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:90%
But who believes in oneness?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And what are the real-world
implications of this belief?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at Duke
University sought

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
to find out how common is this
belief and what does it mean.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman,
humanistic psychologist

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:10%
and author of Transcend, The New
Science of Self-Actualization,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:10%
explored the studies in his
Scientific American article,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:10%
What Would Happen If
Everyone Truly Believed

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.985 align:middle line:10%
Everything Is One?

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:01.732 align:middle line:10%
>> So researchers
were really curious.

00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:10%
First of all, what's
the prevalence

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:10%
of people who believe that we're
all part of a larger whole?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:10%
They found that only
about 25% of people

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.035 align:middle line:10%
reported that they think about
the oneness of all things often

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:17.945 align:middle line:10%
or many times.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, most
people don't even

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:90%
think this sort of way.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of
thoughts are not even

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:90%
permeating their consciousness.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But then in another step,
they create a scale,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
a belief in oneness scale, which
had various items such as--

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
the separation among individual
things is an illusion.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
In reality, everything is one.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The same basic essence permeates
everything that exists.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Beyond surface
appearances, everything

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.033 align:middle line:90%
is fundamentally one.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Although many seemingly
separate things exist,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
they're all part
of the same whole.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.955 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of questions are
all measuring the same thing.

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the significance
of these findings?

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This kind of belief in
oneness was related to feelings

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of connectedness with
distant people and aspects

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It was more correlated with that
than the feeling of closeness

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
with the ones that
already you're close with,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:90%
like your family and friends.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.207 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
People who believe
in oneness actually

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
feel more strongly
related to distant people

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
than most people in their
lives and most connected people

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.178 align:middle line:84%
That has a lot of implications
if you think about it,

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of implications
for our current political

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and religious landscape
where everyone's

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
ripping their heads
off each other

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
because, well, you disagree
with my political point of view?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I never want to have anything
to do with you ever again.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But people who believe
in a sense of oneness

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.132 align:middle line:84%
might be less likely to
immediately distance themselves

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
from someone who disagrees
with them just based

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
on more superficial
characteristics of what

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
it is to be human and look at
the deeper aspects of humanity.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't
believe in oneness,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.045 align:middle line:84%
are you born with that,
or can you develop it?

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:05.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
these are beliefs.

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:10%
These are belief systems.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.963 align:middle line:10%
We can change our beliefs.

00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Beliefs are very malleable.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
a growth mindset.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:90%
They tend to see--

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
think that we can grow and
change throughout our lives

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
than people who have
more of a fixed mindset.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They think that our talents
and our personalities

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.305 align:middle line:84%
are set in stone,
intelligence set in stone.

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Nothing we can do about it.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I think any of us can
really change our mindset.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a mindset.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a oneness mindset.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
We can treat it like a
habit, like a muscle.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And the more we repeatedly treat
others in that kind of mindset,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
the more we build that muscle.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The more we tend to focus on
other aspects of the human,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:90%
the more we build that muscle.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's real
changeability potential here.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:10%
>> These studies show that
the belief that we are all

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:10%
connected through
frequency, vibration,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:10%
or part of some cosmic whole--

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:10%
all individual pieces
but still one--

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:10%
could have real-world
implications.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:10%
An increase in empathy, not
only for our fellow humans

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:10%
but those in the animal
world, and a realization

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:10%
we are the caretakers
of our environment.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
We can greet each
other as fellow humans

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
first and individuals later.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.379 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.629 align:middle line:10%
