00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA confirms the
number of known exoplanets.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's in the thousands
and growing.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Plus, studying the frequency
and tempo of vibrating rock

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:10%
formations in the Utah desert.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Are they in tune with
human vibrations?

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.933 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.797 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:10%
>> For thousands of years
the only known planets were

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
the ones orbiting our sun.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, a major milestone
has just been crossed.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.230 align:middle line:84%
NASA has confirmed we now
have 5,000 known exoplanets.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Exoplanets, planets
outside our solar system,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
weren't even confirmed
to exist until 1992.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, just 30 years later,
that number has exploded.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Thousands were found using
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And we continue to
identify more exoplanets.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
But as Alexander Wolszczan,
who co-discovered

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:10%
those first
exoplanets told NASA,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
we will soon be able to do
a lot more than add planets

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:10%
to the growing list.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
With sophisticated instruments,
such as the James Webb Space

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Telescope currently
in orbit, we will

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
be able to dig deep into
what these exoplanets hold,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
capturing light, determining
which gases are present,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
which planets are
habitable and perhaps are

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:90%
home to extraterrestrial life.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Adding, quote, "to
my thinking, it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is inevitable that
we'll find some kind

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
of life somewhere, most likely
of some primitive kind."

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:10%
The real importance
of this milestone

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:10%
is emphasized by Dr.
Jessie Christiansen--

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:10%
project scientist of the
NASA Exoplanet Archive--

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:10%
and research scientists at
the NASA Exoplanet Science

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:10%
Institute who said, quote,
"It's not just a number.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:10%
Each one of them is a new
world, a brand-new planet.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:10%
I get excited about every one
because we don't know anything

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:10%
about them."

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We are at the beginning of
a long road of discovery.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
As much as 5,000 sounds
like a large number,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
there are potentially billions
of exoplanets out there.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And which planets
could host life

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
could be discovered any day now.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:10%
Standing high above
Utah's Colorado plateau,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:10%
the red rock towers
and arches have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:10%
sat for thousands of years.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:10%
To the Navajo, they
are sacred, believed

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:10%
to be ancient warriors
frozen in stone.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But these rock formations
are not frozen at all.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Even though you
can't see it, they're

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.030 align:middle line:90%
moving, humming, and vibrating.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:10%
In a new study by the
University of Utah,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:10%
researchers working
with expert climbers

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:10%
put seismometers
on the tops of some

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:10%
of these massive formations.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:10%
The results were stunning.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
As the University of
Utah wrote, the rocks,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
quote, "shimmy, twist,
and sway in response

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
to far-off earthquakes,
wind, and even ocean waves."

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:10%
Although you can't see
it with the naked eye,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:10%
in this exaggerated animation
by the University of Utah,

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:10%
you will see how much
these rocks actually move.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
According to the
University of Utah,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
the tests showed the
fundamental frequencies

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of the rocks varied between
about 1-hertz and 15-hertz.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
The larger towers had lower
fundamental frequencies.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And at higher
frequencies, the towers

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
twist around a central axis.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
The geophysicists studying
the rock formations

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
say with this data is
crucial to understanding

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the stability of rock
towers and arches,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
as well as their susceptibility
to hazardous vibrations.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:10%
But it is interesting
to note, the human heart

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:10%
has a resonance frequency
of about 1-hertz.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:10%
The human brain has
a resonance frequency

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:10%
of about 10-hertz, both
in range as the rocks

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:10%
in the Utah desert.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this shows just how
in tune humans can literally

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:90%
be with Mother Earth.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.520 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
