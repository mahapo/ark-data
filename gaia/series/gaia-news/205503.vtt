00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080 align:middle line:10%
>> For the millions of Americans
suffering from post-traumatic

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740 align:middle line:10%
stress disorder, there
may finally be a solution.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:10%
A late-stage clinical trial
of the psychedelic drug MDMA

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:10%
has shown great promise
in treating the condition,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:10%
making FDA approval likely
in the next few years.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
MDMA, an illegal drug commonly
known as Ecstasy or Molly,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
started out as a synthetic
compound created in 1912.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:84%
After a period of use in the
treatment of mental health

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
conditions, it escaped in
the 1980s from the clinic

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to the dance floor and was
criminalized by the FDA.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:10%
But a few proponents continued
to push for research,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:10%
including Dr. Rick Doblin, who
founded the Multidisciplinary

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:10%
Association for Psychedelic
Studies, or MAPS.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Decades later, their efforts
finally led to a green light

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:90%
from the FDA for clinical study.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Since then, there have been
three rigorous clinical trials,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
which have all shown
enormous promise of the drug,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
in combination with
psychotherapy, to treat PTSD.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically people have a
traumatic event that ends up

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.155 align:middle line:84%
being very difficult for the
person to process in the normal

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:10%
Over time, those
walls and barriers

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:10%
that people build up
to protect themselves

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:10%
can interfere with
their ability to have

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:10%
lasting, interpersonal
relationships, trust

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:10%
other people.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
severe symptoms

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.785 align:middle line:90%
of depression and anxiety.

00:01:47.785 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Scott Ostrom is
a former US Marine,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:10%
who has suffered from severe
combat PTSD since he returned

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.945 align:middle line:10%
from his second Iraq
deployment in 2007.

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I was having
horrible nightmares.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't getting great sleep.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:10%
I would cry,
especially if I drank.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:10%
I thought about
suicide very often.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I went and saw a
psychiatrist at that same VA,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and we tried
different medications

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
to help me stabilize.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, none
of them worked.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:90%
They had crazy side effects.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:90%
I just gave up on them.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I felt myself falling apart.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Like I'd be getting into fights.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
I was having a difficult time
keeping my hands in my pockets,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:90%
so to say.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Scott took part in the
latest phase III trial,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
which showed that MDMA
assisted psychotherapy,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
reduced the severity
of PTSD symptoms in 67%

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of participants, to the point
that they no longer qualified

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:90%
for the diagnosis.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.672 align:middle line:10%
Just how does MDMA do this?

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> My lab has
discovered that MDMA--

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:84%
what it does at the level
of synapses and circuits

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and behavior is,
it reopens what's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
called a critical period
of social reward learning,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
by enabling people to open up
again in their social learning

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
capacities and revisit
these traumatic memories,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, and
reconfigure some

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.862 align:middle line:84%
of those memories around
their social behaviors.

00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What is particularly powerful
about the trial findings is

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that MDMA exerted a profound
and lasting effect in just three

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
During the several month
course of Scott's treatment,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
he was able to access a part of
himself he calls "the bully."

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
This alter ego was formed
during his time in combat

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
as a means of self-protection,
but led to suffering afterwards

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:90%
when he no longer needed it.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the guidance
of these two clinicians,

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go all the way
back to the point where I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
became that person, where
that switch happened.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
The light switch
came off, and then

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the new bully switch came on,
and I became this other person.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is within the first
hour and a half, two hours,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%
of our first MDMA session.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And so Scott disconnected
from me, my consciousness,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
and went out and had a
conversation with the bully.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And they talked, and Scott
basically got permission

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:90%
to take over for a while.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been almost two years
since that third session,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and I would still say
that it's very true,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:90%
that Scott has taken over.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Marcela Ot'alora is
a psychologist and lead

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:10%
investigator for the phase
III clinical trials for MAPS.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:10%
>> MDMA-- it lends itself
to have this protective net

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.320 align:middle line:10%
for somebody
working with trauma.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sense
of self-trust,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's also a
sense of opening up

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:90%
to who they truly are.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in addition to the wounded part.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
trauma, who are they?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And that becomes a resource.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So the beauty is that we're
offering something that is not

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:90%
a pill that you take every day.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
You're doing this three times,
and then you're integrating,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're continuing to
work on all the pieces

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:90%
that you learned.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about-- these
are my symptoms.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
They can be really
difficult and challenging,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and I know how to
work with them.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.926 align:middle line:84%
>> For Scott, the therapy
changed everything.

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I got rid of things
that weren't good for me.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had one nightmare
since the MDMA session, which

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is amazing because I had
them for over a decade.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Those episodes of
violence are gone.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Like, I don't get into fights.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
We set out for a goal, which
was to treat my combat PTSD,

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
and that worked.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers now
feel that MDMA-assisted

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy is
effectively a cure for PTSD.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The results that people
are seeing in this trial that

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.370 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about are
dramatic improvements that,

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
after a single or sometimes
two, sometimes three,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
doses of MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
patients are seeing remarkable
reduction in PTSD symptoms

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:90%
and effectively a cure.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
>> For clinicians like
Marcela Ot'alora, FDA approval

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:90%
can't come soon enough.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Our thought is that by 2023
we can have MDMA be a treatment

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:90%
for PTSD.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is that there will

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
be clinics around
the United States

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and the world that are
MDMA-assisted therapy

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
clinics, where people can go and
get this treatment without it

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:90%
being a study.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> FDA approval would not only
open the door to treatment

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
for all those
suffering from PTSD,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but may also pave the way
for clinical studies of other

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic therapies.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Many in the field
feel the time is

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
ripe for this revolution
in mental health.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
