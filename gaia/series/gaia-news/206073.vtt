00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Should the US Space
Force take over the tracking

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and study of UFOs?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Space Force reportedly says no.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they want
this high-profile job?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.874 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
In the wake of the UAP
report to Congress,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:10%
which called for
the US government

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:10%
to, quote, "standardize
the reporting,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:10%
consolidate the data,
and deepen the analysis,"

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:10%
officials are reportedly calling
on the recently formed Space

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Force to play an increased
role in the tracking

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:10%
and study of UFOs.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:10%
But in a recent
report by Politico,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:10%
who spoke to five
unnamed officials,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:10%
Space Force command is wary of
the assignment because, quote,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:10%
"they want people to
take them seriously."

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:10%
With such a high-profile
order for a service

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:10%
which is not even
two years old, why

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:10%
would they balk at the idea?

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:10%
Cheryl Costa is an investigative
journalist and UFO researcher

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:10%
who spent nine years
in the US military,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:10%
including five years as a Navy
electronic warfare specialist.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
She is the co-author of "UFO
Sightings Desk Reference

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:90%
USA, 2001 to 2020."

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as far as
Space Force taking over,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:10%
let's go back to
the early 2000s.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Ships like the Nimitz and things
started experiencing these UFO

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:90%
sightings.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Had that been anything that
resembled a Russian aircraft

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
or a Chinese aircraft, a dozen
different defense intelligence

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.970 align:middle line:84%
groups would have
been all over it.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But we have this
stigma since 1968

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
with the Condon
Report to Congress

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that made everybody
who reports a UFO

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
look like a kook or a crackpot.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
None of the defense intelligence
groups wanted to touch it.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to be
labeled with that stigma.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Finally, since it was the Navy
that was having all the issues,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.357 align:middle line:84%
Navy intelligence
stepped up to the job

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and did what they
were supposed to do.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.980 align:middle line:90%
They investigated it.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.202 align:middle line:10%
My hat's off to
Navy intelligence

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:10%
for doing that because
all these other groups--

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:10%
and now you're hearing
it also with Space Force.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, we don't want
to be around that.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, the government painted
themselves in this corner

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.363 align:middle line:10%
by giving it that stigma.

00:02:23.363 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And they shouldn't
have done that.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.916 align:middle line:90%
But here we are.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Space Force was only
established in December

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:90%
of 2019.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:10%
What is their purpose?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:10%
Why was Space Force created?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.798 align:middle line:10%
>> What's interesting about
Space Force is they were

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:10%
established-- and a lot of
people are missing the point

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:10%
with what it was when
they were established.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot of commercial
real estate up there,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
our whole communications
satellite thing, all

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And the point is
that half the reason

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
we established the Navy back in
1785 was to protect shipping.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got commercial
real estate up there.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody took it out
with a nuclear EMP missile

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
sent up there to explode,
just to put out the radio

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
signal that would burn up all
the satellites electronically,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
we'd be in the 19th century
here in about 20 minutes.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
understand that.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they're
trying to protect.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But now we've entered
this other thing,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and we're owning up to the
fact that maybe there's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
somebody else from another
world that's coming here.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they'll take
advantage of this thing

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and take out our communications
system around the world.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And that would put
the whole culture

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
in about the 16th century.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:90%
We'd be in real deep trouble.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:10%
So that's the big
deal with Space Force.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:10%
They've got,
technically, the mission.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Since they are guarding
US interests in space,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:10%
doesn't it stand to reason
they should study UFOs?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:10%
>> They theoretically have the
mission of being able to look

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.052 align:middle line:10%
at the whole planet as a whole
versus just the oceans or just

00:04:03.052 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:10%
the United States or
something like that.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:10%
So maybe it is a good idea.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
We've got a gap of information,
and a good example here

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.683 align:middle line:84%
is these intelligence agencies
don't want to touch it.

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest with
you, my personal feeling

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:84%
is they haven't had the
clearance or the need-to-know

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:84%
to go in and pick open all
those compartments from all

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
these events that have
happened over the years.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of the defense
organizations

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that are talking
about taking it over,

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Space Force has
the best mission.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:10%
The issue is, will they be smart
enough to staff it up properly?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:10%
>> As someone who has
studied this extensively,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:10%
what is your hope for
how this will turn out?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Space Force should
step up to it robustly and be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:84%
as transparent as they can,
except for the stuff that

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:84%
really should be classified,
that if it's definitely thought

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
out not to be one of our
adversaries on this planet,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
own up to the fact that
somebody else is visiting us.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Give people confirmation.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The American people have grown
up a lot since the 1940s.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
The idea of many
worlds out there

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and many civilizations out
there is not a new idea.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think they really need
to start coming clean with us

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:90%
about this topic matter.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Space Force is probably the
most logical place for it to be.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:10%
I only hope that
they're willing to be

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:10%
transparent about this
within the limits of what

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:10%
their mission is.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Currently, the US Navy
is taking the lead on UFO

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:90%
tracking.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But as deputy Defense
Secretary Kathleen Hicks wrote,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the job has, quote,
"expanded significantly

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:84%
beyond the Secretary
of the Navy's purview."

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
The UFO issue is now mainstream
and deserves serious study.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Will Space Force take
over the UFO assignment

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:10%
or disappear under the auspices
of an intelligence agency?

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:10%
There's no date yet on when that
decision will be made public.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:10%
