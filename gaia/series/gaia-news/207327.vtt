00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.970 align:middle line:10%
>> NASA Chief Bill Nelson says
looking for extraterrestrial

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.560 align:middle line:10%
life is part of NASA's mission,
as top NASA scientists call

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:10%
for a detailed system for
classifying extraterrestrial

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.450 align:middle line:10%
life.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
In a huge departure
from the US government's

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle line:10%
historical treatment of UFOs and
possible extraterrestrial life,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:10%
NASA Administrator Bill
Nelson said in an interview

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:10%
with University of
Virginia's Larry Sabato:

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Who am I to say that planet
Earth is the only location

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:10%
of a life form that is civilized
and organized like ours?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Meantime, top NASA scientists
are calling for a scaled system

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
for reporting any evidence
of extraterrestrial life,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
modeled after NASA's progressive
scale of technological

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:84%
readiness level already in use
for new space flight equipment.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the binary
life-or-no-life way of looking

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
at off-planet discoveries, these
NASA scientists are suggesting

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:84%
a more nuanced way of
reporting what they find.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
Cheryl Costa,
retired journalist,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:10%
UFO statistician, and author
of the "UFO Sightings Desk

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:10%
Reference," thinks
it's about time.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's long overdue.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:10%
They've been talking about
this stuff for years.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They know that there have
been unidentified things

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
in our skies since
biblical times.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they're
finally owning up

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of classifying
alien life, their scale

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:84%
is going to have to run the
range of organic molecules

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
sentient beings.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to be
a pretty big scale.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to start
seeing bona fide scientists

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at this issue and
saying, OK, we need to do this.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And what about NASA
Administrator Bill

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Nelson's comments?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's refreshing
that the NASA chief came out

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and said, yeah, maybe, on the
UFOs, OK, and off-world life,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I think they still know more
than they're telling us.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy NASA's coming
out with this stuff.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I think they're trying to feed
it to us a little spoonful

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
scare the populace.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:10%
>> This seems to be a big
change from the past when,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War, the
government ran a concerted

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:10%
effort to discredit anyone
who spoke out about UFOs.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:10%
What was the mood like
in the country back then?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go back to sort of
Cold War, post-World War II.

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
World War II, yeah,
we had foo fighters.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've interviewed
former vets that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
were flying in B-17s and
things that said, yeah, yeah,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.205 align:middle line:90%
we saw those things.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we thought it
was the other side.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And after the war, they
found out the other side

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:90%
thought it was us.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of thing.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:84%
The more common aspect of UFOs
being reported in the last two

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
generations started
with us setting off

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
three nukes back in 1945, OK?

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Within two years, we
suddenly had them on scale,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
what they call the
massive wave of 1947, OK?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big deal.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
What happened a few years
before the Roswell incident,

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
in 1938 on Halloween Eve, Orson
Welles at the CBS facilities

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
scared the snot
out of the country.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I've-- I never witnessed--

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
someone is crawling
out of the Earth,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
something I can see coming
out of that black hole

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:90%
through luminous disks.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.670 align:middle line:90%
The eyes.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So here we are in 1947.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got this wave
of UFOs going on.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Think about those guys.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Barely 10 years
before, talk of aliens

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
scared the heck
out of everybody.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So there was this whole idea
of maybe the American public

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:90%
isn't ready for this.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in 2021, not only are
governments exploring space,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
but private companies are
in their own space race.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Now that we appear to
be "ready for this,"

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
could we see disclosure
in our lifetime?

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we will have to.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I think we've got so much
going on with our environment.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And two things the ETs who have
talked to people on the ground,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
they said, take
care of your planet.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a
continuing thing.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And the other driving thing
is, they're very concerned

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we
have a proliferation

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:90%
of nuclear weapons.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And our whole present-day
sighting thing

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
is driven by the fact that
we set off three nukes back

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in 1945, and the aliens have
been very touchy about that,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:10%
They don't want us off this
rock with our current politics

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:10%
and all that.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:10%
>> And there is hope.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
With the latest
developments at NASA

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and existing departments
within the agency,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.745 align:middle line:84%
we may see evidence
of off-planet life.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole division in
NASA that looked at the idea

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of what some of these exoplanets
had for gravity and that kind

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
of thing and atmosphere.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
They've gone out and
postulated what kinds of life

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
might survive in
those environments.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
creative how they

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
looked at it and a
very possible thing.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Because life always seems
to find a way, as they say.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:10%
