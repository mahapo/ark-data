>> A fascinating new study shows
our gut microbiome has been

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.010 align:middle line:10%
experiencing a potentially
catastrophic loss of diversity

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:10%
over the last millennium,
possibly giving rise to various

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.740 align:middle line:10%
common chronic diseases.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Is it too late to avoid
irreversible damage

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to our health?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.112 align:middle line:90%

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.250 align:middle line:84%
While most of us don't
ever think about it,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
we co-exist with over
100 trillion microbes.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
which live in our gut

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:90%
and are essential to our health.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Though the existence
of the microbiome

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
was first recognized
in the 1990s,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
the full understanding of
its importance and mechanisms

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
is still in its infancy.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Alex Kostic is
a microbiologist

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
at Harvard Medical
School who has

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.956 align:middle line:10%
been studying the microbiome
as a mediator of disease.

00:00:57.956 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:10%
>> This concept of the
microbiome as a community

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:10%
of organisms living on
humans and other mammals,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:10%
and playing an integral role in
our physiology really is a new

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:10%
concept, something that
people have only been studying

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:10%
for the past 10
or 15 years or so.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But what we've come
to realize as we study

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the ecology of all
microorganisms living

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
on humans, especially in the
guts, it's incredibly diverse

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.300 align:middle line:84%
and pathogens are really
the exception to the rule.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything else has
a lot of other rules

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're still trying
to tap into but we

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
can be fairly confident
that they're not

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.365 align:middle line:90%
driving the disease in people.

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In their quest for a clear
picture of the microbiome,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.445 align:middle line:84%
researchers have recently
turned to studying its history.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What's really got me
interested in the history

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of the human microbiome is
this concept of being able

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to identify, if it
exists, a, quote unquote,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
universal ancestral
human microbiome,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
something that was common to
all of us before the process

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:90%
of industrialization.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The reason why industrialization
is an important marker

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in history for the microbiome
is because it coincides

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:84%
with advances in medical
practices, advances

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in sanitation, but they come
with the big science fact.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And so as we have all
these measures to prevent

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
the spread of
pathogens, we're also

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
preventing the spread
and acquisition

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of beneficial
numbers that we think

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
could be playing an
important role in our health.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> To deepen these
understandings,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
researchers led by Dr. Kostic
recently conducted a study

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in which they analyzed samples
of feces collected from caves

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in the US and Mexico.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
The samples were between
one and 2,000 years old,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and contained
perfectly preserved

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
DNA which was analyzed using
cutting edge genetic sequencing

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
The genetic information
was then compared

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to that of modern
industrialized people.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.582 align:middle line:84%
The findings were
groundbreaking.

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
>> It turns out that 40% of
the genome is reconstructed

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:10%
for a completely new species.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:10%
Never seen before.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:10%
Suggesting again
that what did exist

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:10%
in these ancient
human microbiomes

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:10%
is something that
does not exist anymore

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:10%
and may have undergone
extinction over time.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers then hypothesized
the causes of this alarming

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.955 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that we noticed
from our ancient studies is

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
just how diverse their
carbohydrate metabolism

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.870 align:middle line:90%
functions were.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
reasons was that they

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
ate all sorts of different
kinds of plant materials.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Generally, the most
agreed upon reasons

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:84%
for why the microbes might
be going extinct is diet.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
More processed
foods, less fibers,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
very different composition
of macronutrients.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
As you kind of
introduce this factor

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of removing the food
that they rely on,

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.295 align:middle line:90%
they start disappearing.

00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how is this linked to
the prevalence of modern-day

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:90%
chronic diseases?

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:10%
Ayurvedic practitioner
Dr. John Douillard

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:10%
has been closely following
this field of study.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Your microbiome
regulates your gut immunity.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.900 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't
have good diversity,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to have a
really good immune response.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:84%
In the last 30 years,
the amount of food

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that most humans
eat on the planet

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:90%
has become 50% less diverse.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And there was the traditional
foods that people ate,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
it's now being replaced
by processed high-industry

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:90%
commercial foods.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And those are all
basically sterile

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
because the bugs have been
processed out of those foods.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The exact mechanisms by which
microbes perform their immune

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
functions and guard against
disease are still unclear

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and is a major focus
of current research.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:10%
Researchers are also
working on resurrecting

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:10%
ancient beneficial
microbes, but the process

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:10%
is a complicated and costly one.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
is there anything

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.695 align:middle line:84%
we can do to increase
our own gut diversity?

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The best way to boost
microbial diversity,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.043 align:middle line:90%
the first step is with fiber.

00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And what fiber
does is not only it

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
does feed the bugs in
your gut but also attaches

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to the bile, which is like
a Pacman in your liver

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:90%
gobbling up toxins.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
A Pacman in your
intestinal tracts

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
cleaning out all the villi
in your intestinal tract.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that fiber,
it takes all the toxins

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
to the toilet.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't eat enough
fiber at the 94% of the bile

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
with toxicity to get back
to your liver and they

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
dump their trash
back into your liver,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
making it more difficult for
your body to properly detox.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And in an environment
of toxicity,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
environmental pollutants,
endocrine disruptors,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it's so critically important
we have a detox system that

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:90%
is really optimal.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> For Dr. Douillard, eating
seasonally also plays a vital

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.485 align:middle line:90%
role in promoting diversity.

00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But the studies show that
the bugs in the soil change

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
dramatically from
season to season.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And we have bugs
that are actually

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
a really good at delivering
fiber as fuel in the spring

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and carbohydrates and
starches in the fall.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get
microbial diversity back

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is by starting to eat more
diverse foods in season.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Get the right bugs
at the right season

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
so you have the ability
to burn fat as fuel

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
in the spring and carbohydrates
as fuel in the summer.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Kostic has high hopes
for the future of this field

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>> This to me kind of
speaks volumes to the power

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:10%
of the microbiome and the
therapeutic value of trying

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:10%
to identify microbes to
reintroduce them and develop

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:10%
safe and effective ways
of reintroducing them.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It is going to be a
very important part

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
of the future of medicine.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As we await scientific
advances that may return some

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of our lost microbe friends,
the responsibility is now on us

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to do what we can
to welcome new ones.
