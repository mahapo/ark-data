>> The findings of a
groundbreaking new study

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.140 align:middle line:84%
on lucid dreaming are in and
suggest that those trained

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:84%
in the practice not only
see dramatic improvement

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
in their PTSD symptoms, but
may also experience change

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.210 align:middle line:90%
on a biological level.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>> This is the first time
anybody's looked specifically

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:10%
at a biomarker and related
to healing inside of a lucid

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
dream.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Research into lucid dreams
in which one wakes up

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
inside a dream has produced
some fascinating insight

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:84%
into the neurological
features of this state.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Most of the
investigation thus far

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
has been focused on mapping
brain activity, which

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
has shown the unique
characteristics of the brain

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:90%
function of lucid dreamers.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:10%
In a previous
episode, we reported

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:10%
on the preliminary
findings of a study out

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:10%
of the Institute
of Noetic Sciences,

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:10%
or IONS, the first
of its kind to look

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:10%
at the potential for healing
within a lucid dream,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:10%
both on a psychological
and physiological level.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Garret Yount is a
molecular neurobiologist

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:10%
who led the study and updated
us on the final findings

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.326 align:middle line:10%
of this extraordinary
investigation.

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this study, we
partnered with an awesome lucid

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
dreaming teacher,
Charlie Morley.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And we had heard from him that
his workshops with veterans

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
with PTSD were really, really
helpful in terms of reducing

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:90%
the symptoms of PTSD.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:10%
So we partnered with
him to basically bring

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:10%
a scientific lens to that.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea was to recruit
folks with chronic PTSD.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:10%
We included both veterans
and non-veterans.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
They attended a one-week
workshop from their home.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie taught them
how to achieve lucidity,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
with the goal of transforming
their trauma during the dreams.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we, the
research team, just tried

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to collect data along the
way without interfering

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.125 align:middle line:90%
too much with the process.

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The participants were
taught a variety of induction

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.580 align:middle line:84%
techniques, and most had at
least one lucid dream within

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:90%
the week.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.975 align:middle line:84%
The initial results of
the study were remarkable.

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:27.747 align:middle line:84%
>> The big finding was that PTSD
symptoms decreased dramatically

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
during the workshop.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And amazingly, it stayed
that way all the way

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:10%
when we looked a month later.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.630 align:middle line:10%
The testimonials from
the people in the study

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:10%
were just so inspiring.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They talked about for 10 years
trying all kinds of therapy.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.285 align:middle line:84%
And then in one week-- boom,
their life has changed,

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
they're free of
their nightmares.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty incredible.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers recently analyzed
the data from a particularly

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.715 align:middle line:90%
unique component of the study.

00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the really cool
aspects of the study is we did

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
an exploratory assessment
of a biomarker.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.227 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at an
enzyme called amylase.

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And we looked at levels of this.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
You can measure
it in the saliva.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And we chose amylase
because it's been

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:90%
shown to be a marker of stress.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
With folks with PTSD,
it acts differently.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is indicative of chronic
sympathetic nervous system

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:90%
activation.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:10%
So we were looking
at levels of amylase

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:10%
to see if it might
show that there

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:10%
was a general decrease in stress
after a healing lucid dream,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:10%
and that's exactly
what we found.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So this means that their
general stress levels went down.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So this was amazing.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
This is the first evidence ever
of a physiological biomarker

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
changing in relation to
a healing lucid dream.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What can be the mechanism
behind this phenomenon?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So my best guess
about how it works

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is that this is a way
to tap into the power

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious mind in
a way where you can really

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:90%
direct and manifest healing.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
This is oftentimes inhibited by
our thinking brain or thinking

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think the sweet spot
of this lucid dreaming

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:84%
is where you have a pact
between the conscious mind

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and the subconscious mind to
really bring about healing

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and just let it happen.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> IONS is now planning
a larger follow-up study.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:10%
Should these results
be replicated,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:10%
the implications would be major.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's exciting to see
this physiological biomarker

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
changing in association
with reduced PTSD symptoms.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense because
of the relationship

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:84%
between the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's very exciting
and has huge implications

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for the treatment of PTSD and
other mental illnesses that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:90%
are difficult to treat.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we found
out for the first time

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
evidence of this physiological
biomarker changing in relation

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to the healing lucid dream has
implications for illnesses that

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
are more physically manifested.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
If you can change the level
of enzyme in your body

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
through a healing
lucid dream, that

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
means you can change physical
illnesses, which I think

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:90%
is tremendous.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have the opportunity to
learn a lot about the healing

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
power of the mind.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> IONS is currently recruiting
participants for the follow-up

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
study.
