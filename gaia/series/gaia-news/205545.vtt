>> The Russian military is
reportedly looking to clone

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.640 align:middle line:10%
ancient warriors.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why would they do it?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.992 align:middle line:90%

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.060 align:middle line:10%
In the Siberian
Republic of Tuva lies

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
the remains of Scythian
warriors and their horses,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
buried for nearly 3,000 years.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, Russia's defense
minister, Sergei Shoigu,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:10%
apparently wants to put
them back into action.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:10%
According to ancient origins,
Shoigu has announced his desire

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:10%
to clone the
3,000-year-old soldiers,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:10%
telling the Russian Geographical
Society, quote, "Of course,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:10%
we would like very much to
find the organic matter and I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:10%
believe you understand
what would follow that.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It would be possible to
make something of it,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:90%
if not Dolly the Sheep.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
In general, it will
be very interesting."

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Dolly the Sheep refers to the
first mammal ever cloned back

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
in 1996.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, a Russian Swiss
archaeological team

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is reportedly searching for
viable DNA from the graves

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to clone the ancient warriors.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:10%
But many scientists
are skeptical that this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:10%
is even possible.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:10%
No human has ever been
cloned, that we know of.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
Billy Carson, the founder
of Forbidden Knowledge,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and the author of The Compendium
of the Emerald Tablets,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:10%
on this development.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a huge possibility
that the Russians could clone

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:10%
Scythian warriors,
or for that matter,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:10%
any major government can do
it, because we've had so many

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:10%
decades now in
research into cloning.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Think of all the
black budget projects

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that are going on behind the
scenes, unacknowledged projects

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that the general population
has no idea about.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
they've actually

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
admitted that they can take
a skin cell from someone,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
through the right
laboratory conditions,

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
turn that skin cell into a
stem cell, and then from there,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
turn that stem cell into
any cell in the human body,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
including cloning
an entire body.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.562 align:middle line:84%
So if they can admit
to that publicly,

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:84%
we can only imagine
what they really have

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
going on behind the scenes.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Assuming this technology
is even possible,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that they could clone
these ancient warriors,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
there's an ethical question
surrounding cloning humans

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and certain unintended
consequences.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to really
question the morality of it.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You're taking a
clone of someone.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this being may not
come back with full memory.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But because of
epigenetics, there

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%
will be epigenetic memories.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is now proven
in science and biology,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that we store 15
to 20 generations

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors' memories
and experiences in our DNA.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And it comes in through the RNA.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if they clone
these soldiers,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask the question,
what kind of ancient memories

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
are going to be impacting them?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
How will they respond
to this modern era?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And then also, what
ancient thoughts

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
are going to come that may make
them decide to, either attack,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.953 align:middle line:90%
they are an army, for God sakes.

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can really
do whatever they want.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:90%
They're trained military.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be a
bloodbath, or it could

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:90%
be something that works out.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of tend to
think it would probably

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
be bad for both sides.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Some believe our ancient
ancestors may have had

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
supernatural powers and
connection to nature.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Given the man behind this plan
is the minister of defense,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.857 align:middle line:84%
it's safe to assume he would
want to weaponize these powers.

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons for
them looking into this ancient

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
cloning could be that they're
trying to tap into some ancient

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:90%
knowledge and ancient wisdom.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It could be that our ancestors,
or maybe even our cousins,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe not even Homo sapiens
sapiens yet, in some cases,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
if you can clone
them, you could find

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that we had a better
connection with nature,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.110 align:middle line:84%
maybe had the ability
for telekinesis,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.198 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities,
ability to communicate

00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
with one another silently
without actually having

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to move your mouth, just
transferring thoughts

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.473 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
It's possible they
could be trying

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
to replicate what
mankind maybe should be

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:90%
or trying to aspire to.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were doing
that way back then,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.928 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
that they're trying

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to replicate that right now
and speed the process up.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> This whole story may
sound like science fiction.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But Billy Carson believes
this may have been

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:90%
written about many years ago.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the ancient
tablets, stone tablets,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
you find out about an
ancient Egyptian named Thoth.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And in these tablets,
he writes that he

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
had the capability of
creating bodies, which to me,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of really signifies he
had the ability to make clones.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And he would transfer
his consciousness

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:90%
into those avatar bodies.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And then in the text,
he says he would walk

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
amongst men, but unlike a man.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
he ruled over the land of
Egypt for 14,000 years.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That's quite a bit of time
for one person to rule.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's been seen
all over the planet

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
in various different
cultures, leading

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
me to believe that he may
have had the ability to do

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:90%
this technologically.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Cloning technology
is not necessarily bad.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.290 align:middle line:10%
Scientists are working
to clone lost limbs

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:10%
and regrow spinal
cords, possibly

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:10%
being able to cure
neurodegenerative diseases

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:10%
in the near future.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps, when it comes
to cloning ancient warriors,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:84%
it's best to let the
dead rest in peace.
