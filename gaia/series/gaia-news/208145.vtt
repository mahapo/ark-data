00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.980 align:middle line:10%
practice to heal body and mind.

>> When we cultivate it and
we bring it into our conscious

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:84%
awareness, then it provides a
lot of magical transformation

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and healing for our lives.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:84%
While research in the field
of positive psychology

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
has shown the clear benefits
of positive attributes

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
such as compassion and
empathy, new studies

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
suggest that gratitude may
have the biggest effect of all.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Paul Mills has been studying
the effects of gratitude

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:10%
as a professor at the University
of California San Diego

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:10%
and as a director of research
at the Chopra Foundation.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The way I define gratitude is
it's a way of seeing the world

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:10%
with a sense of heartfulness,
a sense of embracingness,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:10%
an appreciation for all
that is being experienced.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Typically, people differentiate
gratitude from thankfulness.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a response in
exchange to something.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude, really,
at its foundation,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
is more of a dispositional
set where we walk around,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
let's say, with gratitude for
everything that's going on,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
just for really
the gift of life.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Over the last several
years, scientific studies

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:10%
into the psychological
and physiological benefits

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:10%
of gratitude have
grown exponentially.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the
main reasons that research

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
on gratitude has taken off
more than other areas that we

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
typically could call
positive psychology is

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:84%
because the findings,
the significance in all

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
the studies, is so
high and impactful.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So many of the studies that
have been looking at gratitude

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
find more and more
significant effects related

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:90%
to health and well-being.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the more recent
studies on gratitude have

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
focused on the physiological
benefits to the heart.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've done a lot of
research with cardiac patients,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite significant
what we've been able to show

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
that those patients who
have more of a state

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
of dispositional gratitude--
sometimes it's called carrying

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
around an attitude of gratitude
where we feel grateful

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:84%
for pretty much everything
and anything going on--

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
despite what it might be
to other people's eyes,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.875 align:middle line:84%
that has a profound
effect on these patients.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%
They sleep better.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:90%
They have more energy.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
those patients who

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
had been doing the
gratitude journaling,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
they had a significant reduction
in inflammatory markers

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
There's approximately
23% reduction

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in five different
biomarkers of inflammation

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:90%
in over a two-month period.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a striking,
amazing finding.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You would never anticipate
anything like that, even

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:90%
with medications.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Other recent studies have
shown the important role

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
gratitude plays
in mental health.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were studying
people who have what's called

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
persistent mental disorder.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, it was
through the recovery process

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
of getting better when
they had a acute breakdown,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and this included
people who have

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
depression, major
anxiety, bipolar disorder,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.160 align:middle line:90%
and schizophrenia.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is
that gratitude as well

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
as compassion, as well as
a sense of connectedness

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world, very much
supported their recovery

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
through this process of
getting over their disease

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and getting back
to a stable state.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how does gratitude
exert this powerful effect?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It provides us a sense
of connection with not only

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
ourselves but the
world around us.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we have more of
a sense of connection,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:90%
we feel more at home.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:90%
We feel less stressed.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:90%
We feel less depressed.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
There have been several
EEG studies looking

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
at the frequencies
of the brain waves,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and there have been some
fMRI studies looking

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.490 align:middle line:84%
at the structure of the brain
and then just the functional

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.756 align:middle line:90%
activity of the brain.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:20.839 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
These studies have
been showing again

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and again there are differences.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude does change the
behavior and the activity

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.230 align:middle line:84%
of parts of our brain, and
then, structurally, there's

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
evidence for that too.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Mills suggests gratitude
journaling as a great way

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:90%
to build a regular practice.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The easiest route would
be buy yourself a journal

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and begin to spend some time
every day just writing down

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:90%
things you're grateful for.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Over time, maybe you
don't get your journal,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
but just stop and reflect
and have that in your mind,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
what am I grateful for?

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And that will begin
to change your life.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of it.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The evidence has again
and again been shown.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And in my own life, it's
been very transformative.
