Andrew Collins is a

writer who has been researching
human origins for many decades.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:10%
In his latest book,
"Origins of the Gods,"

of UFO and extraterrestrial
phenomena going back

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:10%
to prehistoric times.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:10%
>> My own impetus for
writing this book was to try

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:10%
and understand exactly who the
original ancient aliens were.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
UFOs have always been seen
to be alien spaceships.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I realized at a
very early age, when

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I was investigating the
subject, that something was not

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
quite right.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to
say that we're not

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
dealing with
nuts-and-bolts spacecraft,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
but that there was something
else going on as well.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:10%
What I noticed
many years ago was

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:10%
that there was some kind
of connection between UFOs

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:10%
and human consciousness
in the sense

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
that people that
witnessed this phenomena

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:10%
had a link or
connection with it.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.602 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered if there was
something deeper involved here

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and whether this
was something that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
would have affected the
ancients as well as people today

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:90%
who have UFO encounters.

of hundreds of thousands

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics, Collins
has set forth his comprehensive

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
take on what may be behind
some extraterrestrial contact.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Many UFOs are quite
simply constructs of light,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
whether soft or quite
solid in nature.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And the main constituent of them
is something known as plasma.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Plasma is the fourth
state of matter.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Plasma actually makes
up 99% of the universe.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Plasma itself is essentially
the splitting up of atom.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The freed-up electrons
release photons of light,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
so everything
becomes illuminated.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
What was discovered
a long while ago

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:84%
is that it seemed to act
in an intelligent manner.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:10%
Theoretical physicists,
such as David Bohm,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:10%
realized that plasma
could contain environments

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:10%
that seemed to be alive.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
What he referred to as
a proto-intelligence

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
would inhabit
plasma environments

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.017 align:middle line:90%
on a temporary basis.

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And they would come up
from what he referred

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
to as the implicate older.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
What's more recently
been discovered

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
is that plasma itself may have
an extra dimension of space.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The plasma itself
could act as a portal

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:90%
into higher dimensional realms.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
and we go back

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to the so-called
proto-intelligences

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that David Bohm
was talking about,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
then is it possible that
they can inhabit the plasma

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
constructs that we
identify as UFOs?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The name for these
transdimensional intelligences,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
recently adopted by Collins and
his colleagues, is n-beings.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We see the intelligences
associated with plasma

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
as transformational in nature,
because they would seem to have

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
an influence in
our 3D space time.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But also, they seem
to exist outside

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
of that as well in a
multi-dimensional environment.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
They go between the two.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
The term that we have
used for them in the book

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
is n-dimensional being.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
The n refers to number, because
we can't say exactly how

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:90%
many dimensions are involved.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Collins proposes that the
non-verbal communication that

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
often happens between contactees
and these transdimensional

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
intelligences is made possible
by the idea of quantum

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
entanglement, which states that
particles can be interconnected

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.380 align:middle line:84%
despite the distance
between them.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The connection with UFOs
is that if these plasma

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
environments, these plasma
constructs, what we call UFOs,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, do have some
kind of mental sympathetic link

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
with human consciousness, then
this can only work through

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:90%
entanglement.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, some of
the particles in our heads,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
their twins are within the
actual plasma environments,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and there is this
resonance, this connection

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
these intelligences

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:84%
are able to connect with us and
steer us in certain directions?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
something that is going on now

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and has been going
on in the past,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
probably since the
very beginning.
