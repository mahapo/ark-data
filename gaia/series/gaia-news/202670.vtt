00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.260 align:middle line:10%
>> For the first time,
the United States House

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.740 align:middle line:10%
of Representatives has passed
a bill that would decriminalize

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.060 align:middle line:10%
cannabis.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.592 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:10%
An historic measure
passed the House

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:10%
of Representatives,
new legislation that

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
would decriminalize marijuana.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it would not
only make it legal,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
but would expunge the criminal
records of nonviolent marijuana

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:90%
offenders.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:10%
The MORE Act, or Marijuana
Opportunity Reinvestment

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:10%
and Expungement
Act, was originally

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:10%
sponsored in 2019 by New
York Democrat Jerry Nadler,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:10%
but taken up and passed
in December of 2020.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of
the bill does more

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
than making cannabis legal, but
would also enact a percent tax

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
on the sale of
cannabis that would

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
be reinvested in communities
hurt by the war on drugs

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and remove some criminal
charges for people convicted

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:90%
of marijuana related crimes.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Congressman Nadler said
in a statement, quote,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
"I have long believed that the
criminalization of marijuana

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
has been a mistake, and the
racially disparate enforcement

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:84%
of marijuana laws has only
compounded this mistake

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:84%
with serious
consequences, particularly

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:90%
for communities of color."

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:10%
How did we get here?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Jerry Brown, professor
at Florida International

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.145 align:middle line:10%
University and author of "The
Psychedelic Gospels," explains.

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:10%
>> These drugs were demonized
in the 1970's when Nixon called

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:10%
Leary the most dangerous man
in America, Timothy Leary.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:10%
If only that were our
biggest problem today,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:10%
one of Nixon's two
top aides admitted.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
We knew these drugs, the
psychedelic drugs, cannabis,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
were not harmful, but we
had a political problem.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
We had a civil rights
movement and we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:90%
had an anti-war movement.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
This is where that
all came from.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the promising
research that

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
went on in the '50s and '60s.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Over 1,000 studies on 40,000
human subjects kind of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
got washed away
in that hysteria.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> After decades of being
demonized by politicians,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
media, and society, are we
in the midst of an awakening

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
regarding the
benefits of cannabis?

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Brigitte Mars, herbalist,
university professor,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:10%
and author of "Addiction
Free Naturally,"

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:10%
responds to the significance
of this legislation.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:10%
>> We're going to find out
that this is a plant that could

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:10%
replace many, many
pharmaceuticals,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:10%
because it really was one of
the major pharmaceutical herbs

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:10%
at the turn of the 1900's.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So the potential for this
plant helping the environment

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.535 align:middle line:84%
as well as for the
healing of humanity.

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'd
like to remind people

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that in Genesis, in the Bible
it says, you know, behold, I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.155 align:middle line:84%
have given you every
herb bearing seed.

00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
about like, but don't

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
use that one, which is
probably the most useful one.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Some representatives opposed
to the measure still hold

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
on to the old notion that
marijuana is a gateway drug.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, most alcoholics
started out with milk.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So is milk a gateway drug?

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And cannabis is an herb that
is enabling a lot of people

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to get off their
anxiety medication,

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to get off their
antidepressants,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and even to get off of some
of their pain medicine.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But I, you know, really
think that using things

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.670 align:middle line:84%
with intention and in
good company, maybe

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
when your work is done or
when you're wanting something

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to help your
creativity, is certainly

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
different than using something
to undermine your health

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and destroy your
relationships and your family

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and your career.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot
of work to be done.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time herbalist
and marijuana advocate,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.750 align:middle line:90%
what does this mean?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Legalization of cannabis
has been a very, very long,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
drawn out agenda.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really
glad to see progress.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a
medical herbalist.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So of all the plants
that I've studied,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I do not know any
other herb that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
does as many things for the
environment, for our health,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
for the health of our
planet than cannabis.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:90%
So this is good news.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is that
advocates are one step closer

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to making this a law.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
However, the bill would have
to move on to the Senate

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
where it faces a difficult, if
not impossible path to passage.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But advocates are hopeful
that the future is

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
much greener on the other side.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
