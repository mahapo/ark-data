00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> A rare Black Widow
star system has just been

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.670 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.030 align:middle line:10%
But it is behaving in
such a way that it, quote,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.870 align:middle line:10%
pushes the boundaries of
the evolutionary models.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:10%
A unique and scarcely
seen star system

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
has recently been discovered.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:84%
According to
scientists at MIT, they

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
have found a Black Widow star
system about 3,000 light years

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:90%
from Earth.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:10%
Just as a Black Widow
spider eats her mate,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:10%
these star systems
contain a pulsar,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:10%
which eats an orbiting object.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:10%
Mark Dantonio, astronomer
and Gaia News contributor,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%
explains.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>> What they are our systems
where there was previously

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800 align:middle line:10%
a giant star, a big,
massive star in the system.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And that star blew up.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's two
outcomes to these.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:90%
We call these a supernova.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
The supernova can leave
a black hole behind

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830 align:middle line:84%
if the star is
sufficiently massive.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Or it can leave a
neutron star behind.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
When these neutron stars
collapse like this and form,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, they
form with hot spots

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
usually coming out of their
north and south poles.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
These are called pulsars,
but they're not always

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be in a system
with other objects.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, they're all alone.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, there seems

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to be something
else in the system.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And just like we see in
nature where the Black Widow

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
spider eats its mate, so too
does the pulsar eat the planets

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
or the other stars that
are circling around it.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly how does the
Black Widow eat a star?

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine an ice cube
sitting on a table.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And you hit the ice cube
with air from a fan.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Not much will happen.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you heat the
air in that fan,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.332 align:middle line:84%
like with a blow dryer
or even a heat gun,

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you're going to watch
that ice cube start

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
to melt very rapidly.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
remains of an ice cube

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
are going to trail out
behind it in the direction

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that the stream is coming
from that heat gun.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
we see with this star.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, the pulsar is being
the heat gun effectively.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And the star is the ice cube.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's being
obliterated by the pulsar.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And material is
trailing behind it.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And as the star
orbits the pulsar,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
it leaves this torus of
material around the pulsar

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that is actually not transparent
to radio waves, the signals

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that we look for when
we try to find a pulsar.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made this
object so different in a way

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't readily
seen in the radio spectrum.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
It had to be seen in
the visual spectrum,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%
like we see with our eyes.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of rare.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Kevin Burdge, lead
researcher of the study at MIT,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:10%
also noted this Black Widow
has the shortest known orbital

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:10%
period of just 62 minutes.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:10%
This short orbit, quote,
pushes the boundaries

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:10%
of evolutionary models.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
What else can we take
away from this discovery?

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Finding this object is
definitely going to change

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
our perspective on how
these objects interact.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Pulsars we know are really,
really deadly places to be.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And we'd never survive
being near a pulsar.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Don't get me wrong because that
outflow of energy from a pulsar

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:90%
would basically fry you.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we have not

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
had a ringside seat
with, but we also now see

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.150 align:middle line:90%
something very, very important.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And that is how a pulsar acts
on another nearby object.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
We're getting to
see how that works.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And that interaction
is extremely important

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
because that's something
we've never seen before.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And hey, that's what
the universe is about.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Finding things you've
never seen before.
