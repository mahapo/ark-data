>> A groundbreaking recent
discovery of a huge fossilized

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.180 align:middle line:10%
skull in China has archeologists
embroiled in heated debate.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.940 align:middle line:10%
Is this extraordinary
finding evidence

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.930 align:middle line:10%
of a new human species?

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Over the last several
decades, the view

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution during
the past half a million years

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:84%
has become ever more complicated
with the regular additions

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:84%
to the list of human
species that lived

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
during the Pleistocene period.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Working out the relationship
between these populations

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
of early humans and how
they relate to modern humans

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:84%
has proven difficult, and
at times, contentious.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The new finding in China is one
of the more recent additions

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:90%
to the growing debate.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins is an
ancient history researcher

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.106 align:middle line:10%
who has been closely
following these discoveries.

00:01:02.106 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:10%
>> An incredible discovery
has been made in China.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And this is of a fairly
massive human skull.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:90%
It's around 140,000 years old.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
that they notice is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's got features which
are in common with Homo

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, that's
ourselves, but also

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
what they call archaic humans.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
In other words, those types of
humans that were in the past

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
and don't quite exist today.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And it had, for instance,
these massive brow ridges.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
It was incredibly wide.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
The size of the skull
was quite massive.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.746 align:middle line:84%
And the nose, how was it was
incredibly large as well.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The Chinese team did
a statistical analysis

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and concluded that it was unlike
any other skull that's ever

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
been found, essentially
deeming it a new species.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
They named it Homo
Longi, which translates

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to Dragon Man for the region
in which it was found.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:10%
Despite the dramatic
announcement,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:10%
most researchers
in the West have

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:10%
cast doubt on the
assessment, claiming

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:10%
there isn't enough
evidence to convince them

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:10%
that this skull
represents a new species.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.366 align:middle line:10%
Many have an alternate theory.

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the Western
scientists have now found out

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
about the skull and have
been asked to comment,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
are almost unanimous that
it's not a new species,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that what it is, is a
skull of a Denisovan.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And the Denisovans are this
branch of the human family

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
tree, if you like,
that have similarities

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
with the Neanderthals,
but was spread mostly

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in the eastern part of
the Eurasian continent.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
We found evidence of them, a
place called the Denisova Cave

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:90%
in Siberia.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We found evidence of them
on the Tibetan Plateau.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
paleoanthropologists

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
are now looking at
the Dragon Man skull

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and saying that is the
face of a Denisovan.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.981 align:middle line:10%
>> Just who were the Denisovans?

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we didn't know
anything about them until 2010.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, a
small finger the bomb

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
that was found in
the Denisova Cave

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia, which
was a site that's

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
been occupied for hundreds
of thousands of years

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.220 align:middle line:84%
from about 400,000 years
forwards was examined.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was found to
belong to a type of human

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:90%
which we'd not seen before.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't Homo sapiens,
it wasn't Neanderthal,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
it was something
completely different.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And when the so-called genome
was extracted from this finger

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
bone, it was found that a small
percentage of this Denisovan

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
DNA was present in a whole
number of modern populations.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look on
the Dragon Man skull,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
we can say that this has
all of the different traits

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and attributes that suggest
to us that this is a Denisovan

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.009 align:middle line:90%
skull.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To researchers
like Andrew Collins,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
there is great significance
in this finding.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the important things
about the discovery of this new

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:10%
skull is that it allows us to
see a facet of ourself within

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:10%
this discovery in the sense that
not only does it have so-called

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:10%
archaic features, but there are
traits here of modern humans.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's significant
because if it is Denisovan,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
then the Denisovans of the
Denisova Cave in Siberia

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:90%
were incredibly sophisticated.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
They were, in many
ways, our forerunners.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is a good chance
that the technologies

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Denisovans were passed
on to our own direct ancestors

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
when we reached the
same region, probably

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
around 45,000 years
ago, and encountered

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:84%
the last of the Denisovans,
that they gave us

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.356 align:middle line:90%
their technologies.

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> These technologies included
advanced stone tool, jewelry,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and clothing-making techniques,
and possibly even horseback

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:90%
riding.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
All these were
previously attributed

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.496 align:middle line:84%
to people of the Bronze Age
nearly 500,000 years later.

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And the conventional views of
archeology is that we invented

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
all of these things ourselves
ad-hoc, independently,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
here and there, across
the Eurasian continents.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as if all of
this came from the Denisovans.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what the evidence
is coming out of,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.150 align:middle line:84%
the Denisova Cave
in Siberia, that all

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
of this, this whole package, if
you like, of human technology

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
was already in place
amongst the Denisovans

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and they gave it to us.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:10%
>> For Andrew Collins, there
is another major implication

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.752 align:middle line:10%
of this new discovery.

00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
things about this new discovery

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
is the massive size of the skull
because it confirms to us that

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the Denisovans, who almost
certainly is a representative

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of, were huge.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And if that's
solid, then we could

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
be looking on the face
of a giant, basically.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who was perhaps
as tall as around 7 feet,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and confirms to us the fact that
giants existed in this world

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
People like myself,
and my colleagues

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
have been trying
to site for years

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that now there is evidence
of some kind of human group

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:90%
that was of immense size.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Almost certainly linked
with the Denisovans,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.240 align:middle line:90%
that existed in the past.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So finally, we have evidence
that there were giants

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.805 align:middle line:90%
in the Earth in the past.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers will surely
continue to debate the true

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:90%
origins of this new finding.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully bringing
us one step closer

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:10%
to a fuller understanding
of our own origins.
