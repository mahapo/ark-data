wiped out by rising waters

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Along the coast of
the Netherlands,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the ocean has been
giving up its secrets.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:84%
About 10,000 years
ago, what is now

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
water was a landmass filled
with flora, fresh game,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and from what we can tell,
a flourishing civilization.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the last
Ice Age, as glaciers melted,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
sea levels rose, and what
remained of this area

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is believed to have been
knocked out by a tsunami.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:10%
Dubbed Doggerland after
a Doggerbank, a sand bank

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
off the coast of England,
archeologists first

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:10%
learned of the potential of
the Stone Age civilization

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:10%
there in 1931 when a fishing
boat pulled up a barbed antler

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:10%
spearhead.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:10%
There has been
interest in Doggerland

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:10%
since then, but only
in the last decade

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:10%
or so has there been intense
study using high-tech seafloor

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:10%
mapping equipment and low-tech
citizen archeologists who

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:10%
bring their finds to the
National Museum of Antiquities

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:10%
in Leiden, Southern Holland.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Fishermen have found
the remains of mammoths,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
hyenas, lions, as well as
prehistoric tools, weapons,

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and a skull fragment.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the Atlantis
that Plato wrote about?

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Some experts disagree.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.072 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary, researcher and
author of Paranormal Planet.

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:10%
>> There are various points that
connect Doggerland to the idea

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:10%
that it could have been the
actual story of Atlantis.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And Doggerland fits all of the
pieces given to us by Plato,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
which came to him by Solon
the Great who had actually

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
gone to Egypt and had
deciphered the Egyptian priest,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
had him rewrite this history,
and he brought it back

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:90%
to Greece.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we know about
Atlantis and Plato's Timaeus

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:90%
writing.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
descriptions was

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
that it was beyond the pillars
of Hercules, which is the rock

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.170 align:middle line:90%
formations of Gibraltar.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
As a bird flies,
Doggerland is much closer

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
to where Plato was than any
of the other locations that

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
have been offered up as
possible locations for Atlantis.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And Doggerland was
and is described

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
as being by scientists a
prehistoric Garden of Eden.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.456 align:middle line:10%
>> Science and history
writer, Andrew Collins.

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:54.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't believe that
Doggerland is the Atlantis

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.380 align:middle line:10%
of Plato.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:10%
What I will say is
that it probably

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:10%
contributed to European legends
of an equivalent Atlantis.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
even referred to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:90%
as Atlantis of the North.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And there are certainly
some Germanic legends

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
that talk about a lost kingdom
that probably is in that area.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And they probably,
therefore, are a member

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.266 align:middle line:90%
of the Doggerland landmass.

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrew Collins has also
written extensively about

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the possible connection between
Gobekli Tepe and Doggerland.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The connection between
Doggerland and Gobekli Tepe

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
comes to the fact that we're
dealing essentially with

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the same culture, those that
made those beautiful stone

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
enclosures in Southeast Turkey
by some 11,600 years ago

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
essentially come from the same
root salts as those that would

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
eventually come to
occupy Doggerland.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And those are people
known as the Swiderians.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that the stone
tools and bone tools that have

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
found at Doggerland which date
to the end of the last Ice

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Age-- so again, around
the time of Gobekli Tepe--

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
they are identical to those
that were made by the Swiderians

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
much further east,
the society in places

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:90%
like Lithuania and Estonia.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Who were the people who
settled on and later fled

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Doggerland?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.382 align:middle line:84%
What is their significance
in the timeline of history?

00:04:37.382 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what's
important about Doggerland

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and the discoveries being
made there is that it is like

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
the missing link between
Gobekli Tepe and the megalithic

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
cultures, particularly
those at Britain.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The Doggerland people were the
mother or the foundation point

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
of certainly Britain's
megalithic culture

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and arguably others in other
parts of Europe as well.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:10%
>> But what if we were able
to prove that Doggerland was

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.105 align:middle line:10%
actually Atlantis?

00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we learn
about Doggerland,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
the more it seems to fit the
perfect profile for Atlantis.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we can find that point,
that zero point where Atlantis

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
actually existed, we may
discover secrets we never even

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:90%
dreamed possible.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We may discover
new technologies.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
We may discover scrolls
or books, who knows?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But it could be a
vast treasure trove

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that helps the human
race recover their lost

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
history from this
type of amnesia

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:90%
that we seem to possess.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Was Doggerland the
Atlantis of Plato?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Is there a direct
connection to Gobekli Tepe?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Or is it some
combination of both?

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
As exploration continues,
we may learn the answer

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to this mystery at
the bottom of the sea.
