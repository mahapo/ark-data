It's time to meet Sagittarius A.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
we've thought about for a long

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.055 align:middle line:84%
time is that there might be
giant black holes in the center

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of galaxies.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns
out, that's true.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
The Event Horizon Telescope
has captured the first photo

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:10%
of Sagittarius A, a massive
black hole in the Milky Way.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:10%
This is only the second
image of a black hole.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:10%
The first was Messier
87 photographed in 2019.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
This time, an international
team of more than 300 scientists

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
from 80 different institutions
worked on the project.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Feryal Ozel, a professor of
astronomy and astrophysics

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Arizona and
a member of the research team,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:10%
said, quote, "Until now, we
didn't have the direct picture

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:10%
to prove that this gentle giant
in the center of our galaxy

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:10%
is a black hole.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.890 align:middle line:84%
It shows a bright
ring surrounding

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
the darkness and the
telltale sign of the shadow

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of the black hole."

and "Gaia News"
contributor Marc Dantonio,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:10%
what is the Event
Horizon Telescope?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, imagine this.

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:10%
We have a telescope.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:10%
It has a diameter, and it
has a lens or a mirror.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:10%
And the bigger that
lens or that mirror,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:10%
the more light
can be brought in,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and the more information
we can gather.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:10%
We looked at this with a
bunch of these telescopes

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.600 align:middle line:10%
around the Earth, and we
let the Earth rotate out

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:10%
from underneath the
object it was looking at.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:10%
We got these arcs of content
data from this object

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:10%
as the Earth rotated.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And we did that with
eight different telescopes

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, OK?

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
And those were combined
to form, effectively,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:10%
an 8,000-mile
diameter telescope.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's the
diameter of the Earth.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
What that does for us is it
gives us tremendous resolution,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
beautiful resolution.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that is unprecedented.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an interesting find
and great for astronomers.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
What's the big takeaway?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a monumental
discovery for a couple

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:90%
of reasons.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, it confirms that
the theory of relativity

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:84%
is correct, because
relativity predicted

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
what the shape of the
black holes in Messier 87

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:90%
and our galaxy would look like.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:90%
And this is exactly what we see.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:10%
Number 2, we're able
to image a black hole

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:10%
for the very first
time in Messier 87

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:10%
and then again with a brilliant
success in our own galaxy.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:10%
That method for doing
that is using these radio

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:10%
telescopes all linked together,
which is the third thing.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.490 align:middle line:10%
We've now managed
to link telescopes

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:10%
all over the world together
to form one massive telescope.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Not an easy feat
because the signal

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
getting to a telescope
closer to the black hole,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
say, in our galaxy on the
other side of the Earth

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.943 align:middle line:84%
is slightly different
in the amount of time

00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
it takes for the signal to get
to that detector versus one

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.620 align:middle line:90%
across the Earth.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The distance across the
Earth is a slight difference.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.862 align:middle line:84%
We'd never notice
it with our eyes,

00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you saw light beams
shine from one side of the Earth

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
to the other, but the telescopes
and the electronics do.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And so those signals have to
be taken in and normalized,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
fixed for the
delay that it takes

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.165 align:middle line:84%
for the light to go one
extra few thousand miles.

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And once they normalize
that, then they

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
can build an image
that makes sense.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What's next?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
What can we look forward
to in the future?

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's play this
forward a few years.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
The Event Horizon
Telescope right

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.633 align:middle line:84%
now is limited to
eight instruments.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're eight instruments at
various locations on the Earth,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
so we're getting a very rough,
crude 8,000-mile diameter

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.562 align:middle line:90%
telescope.

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But if we can add more
instruments to that mix,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
we might get a much more refined
8,000-mile diameter telescope.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
we can really, really

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
use if we could use
it for other purposes,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
like trying to
look for exoplanets

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
or trying to see other
worlds that might have

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
an atmosphere like our own.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's a possibility to
use this type of approach for.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.510 align:middle line:84%
But again, it has to be refined
quite a lot more for that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.628 align:middle line:90%
to be useful.

00:04:41.628 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have the James
Webb Space Telescope

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:10%
that's out there.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:10%
It's got a 21-foot diameter
set of mirrors on it,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:10%
OK, compared to the
Hubble's 8-foot.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:10%
So 8 feet versus 21 feet,
huge difference in capability.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's already, just
in the testing phase,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.915 align:middle line:84%
making tremendous
scientific discoveries.

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look
forward to some greater

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
discoveries with the
Event Horizon Telescope.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But why we want to know about
the black holes in the center

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
of our galaxy, the
center of Messier 87,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
is because we're trying to
shore up the theory that maybe

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
these galaxies all have what we
call SMBHs, Supermassive Black

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Holes, in their center.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.395 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what an idea.

00:05:26.395 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And does that mean that's where
the galaxies first came from?

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Did they seed the
galaxies, and then

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:90%
stuff started spinning around?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's part of the fun.
