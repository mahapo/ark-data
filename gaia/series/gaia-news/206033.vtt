00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.140 align:middle line:10%
>> A groundbreaking new
experiment shows the power

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:10%
of the mind to influence matter.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.815 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:10%
The Institute of Noetic
Sciences founded in 1973

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:10%
by astronaut Edgar
Mitchell has for decades

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:10%
been at the forefront
of scientific research

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:10%
into psychic phenomena and
the nature of consciousness.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:10%
Much of their study
has been around

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:10%
psychophysical phenomena, or
the ways in which our mind

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:10%
or consciousness affects the
physical world of matter.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
In a new experiment, scientists
added a novel element

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
from the world of quantum
physics, which may

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
prove to be quite significant.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Dean Radin is the chief
scientist at IONS and head

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:10%
of the study.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:10%
>> It has been said that there
are strange things associated

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:10%
with quantum mechanics that are
very similar to strange things

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
associated with
psychic phenomena.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The two things in
quantum mechanics

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.382 align:middle line:84%
that are often called
weird because they're

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
strange involve a property
called nonlocality,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:90%
which means that objects--

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
separated in space--

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:90%
are somehow still connected.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
This is what Einstein called
"spooky action at a distance."

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it took roughly 60
years for scientists

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to figure out ways of
telling whether or not

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:84%
things really were
connected in a nonlocal way.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.522 align:middle line:84%
So now we not only know
that that is a fact,

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
but there are
technologies that are

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
being used that use this
property of nonlocality.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The second thing in
the quantum mechanics

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that the observer,
simply by observing a system,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:90%
can change its behavior.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
There's some kinds
of systems that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:84%
can be set up, like optical
systems, where if you observe

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
where a photon goes in
the optical system, then

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
the photon's
behavior will change.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because you're
interfering with the photon.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It has something to do with
extracting information out

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:90%
of the optical system.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In this latest experiment,
researchers explored this

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
observer effect by setting
up an optical system in which

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
participants observed for the
first time a set of nonlocal

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:90%
entangled photons.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at the history
of studies on mind-matter

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.103 align:middle line:84%
interaction, the mental part
is always nonlocal in the sense

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
that your mind is going
to influence something

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:90%
at a distance.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the kinds of targets

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
that have been studied--

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very wide
range, everything

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
from photons and electrons
to water to human behavior

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%
to random events, a huge range--

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:90%
all of those targets are local.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
This new experiment
involving entangled photons

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is, by definition, a
nonlocal matter target.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
It's hunks of matter-- or energy
in this case-- with photons

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
that are nonlocally connected.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We used a device that
actually produced

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:84%
about 1,000 entangled
photons per second.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we're interested in
does a nonlocal mind interact

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
with nonlocal matter.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In the experiment,
participants were instructed

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
to focus their attention on a
computer screen in which were

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
projected entangled photons,
which appeared as a line graph.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
When the line
appeared, they were

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
told to try to make it
go up with their mind.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And when it disappeared, to
withdraw their attention.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The degree to which participants
were able to affect the photons

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
was a measure of the
degree to which they

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
were affecting the strength
of the photon's entanglement.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The results, while
preliminary, were compelling.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So entanglement is not
an all-or-one phenomenon.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
There's a spectrum.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
So a very, very
weak entanglement--

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
if you just go
below the weakness--

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:90%
it's classical particles.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
They are two particles, which
are completely separate.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The moment they
become entangled,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
they share properties, even
though they're separate.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:10%
And so the degree
to which they share

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:10%
those properties, the strength
of it, that can be modulated.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:10%
So we wanted to see,
could the mind modulate

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:10%
nonlocal entanglements.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:10%
And so to make a very long
story short, the answer is yes.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:10%
So what we found
was that when people

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:10%
were asked to focus
their attention

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:10%
towards the
entangled photons, we

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:10%
found that the entanglement
strength increased.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:10%
>> What are the implications
of this finding?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This actually has interesting
pragmatic consequences

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
because in technologies
that are using entanglement,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
the fidelity of the
entanglement is very important.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to
maintain entanglement.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
fragile phenomenon.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you're creating
quantum computing or quantum

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
cryptography or a range
of many other times

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of quantum-based
technologies, a lot of effort

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
is used to maintain the
quantumness of the connections.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it turns out
that simply focusing

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
your mind towards
these quantum objects

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
maintains the fidelity,
especially entanglement

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
fidelity, that is doing
what is necessary in order

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
to make these things work.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So you could project
then that if we

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
get really good at
this kind of task, then

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
we can make quantum computers
work better simply by focusing

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:90%
our mind towards it.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Beyond these potentially
revolutionary applications,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:10%
there's an even greater
implication of this research.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:10%
>> When your intention
is focused on something,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:10%
it's not just in your head.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:10%
It's aspects of the
world are changing.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So the most interesting
thing about this experiment

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the aspect
of the world that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.143 align:middle line:84%
changed, we think
in this experiment,

00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
entanglement, which

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
is the-- you can think of
it as a very deep element

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.270 align:middle line:90%
of the fabric of reality.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But if, in fact, the mind
can influence to that level,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
the current ideas
within physics is

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that our notions of space and
time themselves, those things

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
are not fundamentals,
as we already

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
know from relativity theory.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually
emerged out of entanglement.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:10%
So if entanglement seems to
be a more fundamental way

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:10%
of thinking about the nature
of reality, and that gives

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:10%
rise to space and time.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:10%
So if your mind can
influence entanglement,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:10%
it means that you can warp
space and time itself.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Further investigations are
forthcoming and could lead not

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
only to dramatic technological
advancements but to a deeper

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
very fabric of reality.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:10%
