The overlap between the
psychedelic experience

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and the Near-Death
Experience, or NDE,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:90%
has been noted for decades.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, new research into
the neural activity

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
experienced when under the
influence of psychedelics

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
is providing valuable context

Dr. Eben Alexander
is a neurosurgeon

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.490 align:middle line:10%
who experienced an NDE
in 2008 and has since

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:10%
been studying the
phenomenon and sharing

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:10%
his findings in a number
of bestselling books.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:10%
>> This research for
psychedelics that has been

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:10%
so fascinating, not only does
it show that the brain goes dark

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:10%
under the influence
of such substances,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
they actually showed this
beautiful inverse correlation

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:10%
between the amount of turning
off and dissolution of that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:10%
default mode network, as
demonstrated on functional MRI,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:10%
with the degree of liberation
of the consciousness away from

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:10%
the ego into these kind
of unfettered realms

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:10%
of transcendental and kind
of paranormal experience.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It shows us in a
very concrete fashion

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that the brain activity is not
actually causing all of this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:10%
But it's more the brain
getting out of the way.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Researcher Rick Strassmann
was the first to rigorously

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:10%
study the overlap between
the psychedelic experience

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:10%
and the near-death experience.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.480 align:middle line:84%
The commonalities are
quite significant.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all about
entering new realms--

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean realms, entire
immersive experience

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
in worlds that are different
from our material realm.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very common theme
in those drug experiences,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:84%
as well as in
near-death experiences.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
There's also this extraordinary
kind of world of beings,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of entities, of guides,
of intelligences.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.806 align:middle line:84%
It's showing this
incredible unification

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and witnessing kind
of a sense of being

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in binding force of love
through these experiences.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
kind of commonality

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
of lesson and transformation.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have been focused
on trying to determine what

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:90%
accounts for the similarities.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
One theory is that
the overlap is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
due to the action of the
potent psychedelic, DMT,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
which is naturally released
by the pineal gland

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of death.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.072 align:middle line:90%

[WHOOSH]

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't really think
we have a lot of evidence

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of the DMT dump, as
it's often called.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, with any
materialist addressing of NDEs,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.320 align:middle line:84%
you run into that
absolute giant brick wall.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
What about shared
death experiences?

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But in a shared
death experience,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the
departing loved one

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
comes along and whisks
the bystander's soul

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
away to go through a
full-blown experience.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The fact that ordinary people
in that kind of setting,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
without being near death, can
have a spiritual journey that's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
identical in quality and power
to the near-death experience,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
but they're not near
death, should tell you

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot about
what a waste of time

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
it is for materialist
scientists to try and muddy

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
the waters by pretending
that decreased oxygen

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
tension, increased
CO2, or a dump of DMT

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
from the pineal gland
is causing the effect.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>> While Dr. Alexander sees
the similarities between

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:84%
the near-death and
psychedelic experience,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
he also sees some key
differences based on his own

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
experiences with both.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I took it on myself to look
into a scientific acquisition

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:90%
of that kind of an experience.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to do
that with 5-methoxy-DMT,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
the most powerful

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:90%
of such substances known.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell
you in a nutshell

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
is that I do believe that such
substances and the experiences

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
they engender give us a glimpse
of the spiritual realms that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:90%
are encountered in an NDE.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But from my personal experience
in both of those worlds,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
5-methoxy-DMT experience was

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
like looking through a keyhole
on a dark and stormy night

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and trying to discern what was
going on in that territory.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It really lacked the
power and the depth

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and the breadth of what I
went through in the NDE.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> While Dr. Alexander values
the neuroscience research being

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
done into how psychedelics
may engender an NDE-like

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
experience, he believes there
is a better way of accessing

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:90%
the same spiritual realms.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.917 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The psychedelic drugs
certainly could be useful

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:84%
for helping to define
the scientific landscape

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I would just argue that
meditation, centering prayer,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:84%
these are the best
place to go to get

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
deep and profound
transcendental experiences

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual realm.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
can learn how there

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:84%
is overlap between the
therapeutic benefit

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.090 align:middle line:84%
of the substance versus
meditation, I think,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:84%
the more we can come at the
very safe and effective ways

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish these
goals of healing.
