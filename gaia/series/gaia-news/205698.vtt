>> A new discovery in space may
make us rethink everything we

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.060 align:middle line:10%
know about the universe.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.430 align:middle line:10%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Scientists at the University
of Central Lancashire in the UK

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
have discovered a giant ark,
an extremely large crescent

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:10%
structure of galaxies
in distant space.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:84%
PhD candidate Alexia Lopez who
made the discovery said, quote,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
"It's so big that
it's hard to explain

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:90%
with our current theories."

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The cosmological
principle states

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
homogeneous and isotropic,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:84%
meaning the universe looks
the same in all orientations.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.490 align:middle line:10%
So how does the giant
ark challenge our way

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:10%
of thinking about the universe?

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia news
contributor Marc Dantonio.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>> This giant ark is really
interesting because we've seen

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:10%
large scale structures
before in the universe,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:10%
but nothing of this size.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
The proportion of
this is something

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that's actually outside
our understanding

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.565 align:middle line:90%
of current cosmology, actually.

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is that this
particular arc, it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
about 9.2 billion light
years away from us.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.473 align:middle line:84%
And it's about 3 1/2, 3.4
billion light years in size.

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, keep in mind
that's a good fraction

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.348 align:middle line:84%
of the size of the known
universe, which is somewhere

00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
in the order of like 91
or 92 billion light years

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
We might have to
rethink everything

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
about what we understand about
cosmology, because the way we

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
think of it now in
cosmological theory

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is you get to larger
and larger scales,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
things become more
homogeneous in the universe,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:90%
more rounded out, more averaged.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And you shouldn't expect to see
very large scale disturbances

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can have things
at the scale of around

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:90%
a billion light years in size.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't violate our
cosmological principles

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:90%
that we understand.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
But this new ark
that was discovered,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
it's billions of
light years across.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:10%
That's huge for something that's
supposed to be smoothed out

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and homogeneous at that scale.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:10%
>> How did scientists just
discover this massive ark now?

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In astronomy, we
can't touch anything.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So all we have is the light
coming to us from objects,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that light has to
be kind of coerced and coaxed

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:90%
to give up some secrets.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.227 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
case, they were

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
looking at the light
of magnesium 2,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and they discovered this large
scale structure using that,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
because this is a spectral
region that has never really

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:84%
been explored at this
scale before, obviously.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And then what they found
was this amazing arc.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's literally

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
9 billion light years away.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> New discoveries challenge
old theories all the time.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so significant?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Consider that when
the universe started,

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it was a big bang, and it
went like this, just boom.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It expands outward.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it expanded outward,
things become more spread out.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Things become more
distant from each other.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And larger scale
structures would

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
tend to not form in
our previous theory

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
because these would be
objects that are moving

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:90%
far away from each other.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the universe
would become more evenly

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
spaced out as the
expansion continued.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
look at this finding,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we see this gigantic
structure that technically we

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
don't understand why it's there,
because it shouldn't be there.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
If the universe
truly was as it was

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
expanding becoming more spread
out and more evenly spaced--

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that's what I mean by
the term homogeneous.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the universe
being relatively regular

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
at large scales is
something that's

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
been a sort of a foundational
tenet of cosmology.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is serving to
upset the apple cart.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding out that not
only that, some of the apples

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:90%
aren't apples at all.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> What does this discovery
mean for the future of astronomy

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.222 align:middle line:10%
and our understanding
of the universe?

00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a certain
understanding within

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:90%
a framework that we understand.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And that framework
is this tunnel vision

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:90%
that we have as humans.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
That result works for
this, so let's keep

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
going in that direction.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
However, sooner or later, that
tunnel is going to widen out,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
but you're going
to still be looking

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.150 align:middle line:84%
at the narrow beam
ahead of you and missing

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:90%
all this other stuff out here.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what we've done here.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We've come up with
cosmological principles

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
based on observations.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And now the universe
is showing us

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that our observations
are really quite myopic,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and we need to broaden
our understanding.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The team who made this
discovery ran a statistical

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:10%
analysis on their data and
concluded they have a 99.9%

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:10%
confidence in their results and
will continue to explore what

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:10%
we can learn from
this giant arc.
