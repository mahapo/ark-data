>> Every day, we are
under a constant barrage

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.370 align:middle line:10%
of advertising.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.340 align:middle line:10%
Some estimates say the
average person sees up

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:10%
to 10,000 ads in a day.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:84%
Now, are the advertisers
coming for our dreams?

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:10%
Henry David Thoreau once wrote,
"Dreams are the touchstone

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
of our characters."

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:10%
But for some companies,
dreams might be the touchstone

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
for advertising their products.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:10%
According to thehustle.com,
companies like Molson Coors

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:10%
are conducting experiments to
infiltrate your subconscious

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.730 align:middle line:10%
and make you dream
about their products.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:10%
Last year, volunteers
were reportedly

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:10%
asked to watch
this strange trippy

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:10%
video laden with Coors imagery.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:10%
The volunteers then went
to sleep while listening

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:10%
to audio from the video.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:10%
Coors wanted to, quote,
"shape and compel

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:10%
the subconscious to dream
about their products."

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:10%
And apparently, it worked.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
About 30% of the participants
reported Coors in their dreams.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
One woman told The Hustle
she had a series of,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:90%
quote, "weird Coors dreams."

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Later, she said they were
brought into a focus group

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
where she said, quote, "We
all felt like lab rats.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't
really sit right."

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
This type of suggestive behavior
to elicit specific dreams

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is called targeted
dream incubation or TDI

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
where, for example, the
brain is trained while awake

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to associate a sound
or smell with an item.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Then as the person goes to
sleep, the sound or the scent

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
is introduced, and the person
will dream about the associated

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
item.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:10%
Sleep researchers argue
the treatment aspect of TDI

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:10%
shows many positive
implications, including

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:10%
helping with
depression, alleviating

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:10%
post-traumatic stress disorder,
fighting addiction, and helping

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:10%
us learn.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:10%
But as researcher
and MIT PhD student,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:10%
Adam Haar Horowitz said in an
interview, quote, "On one hand,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:10%
dream manipulation
is gaining acceptance

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:10%
and has all these
great applications.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand it's,
"Oh, [BLEEP],, the advertisers

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:90%
are coming."

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:10%
Coors is not the only company
looking into dream ads.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:10%
Microsoft, Sony, Burger
King, and some airlines

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:10%
are reportedly looking into
TDI advertising as well.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
For now, this is a
voluntary practice.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
There must be an auditory
stimulus during sleep

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:90%
for it to work.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But some warn with the
rise of smart devices,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
some unethical advertisers
could send signals

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
through smart speakers in
our sleep without us knowing.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Sleep researchers
are so concerned,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
last year they wrote an open
letter signed by nearly 40

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
scientists, warning that, quote,
"Our dreams cannot become just

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
another playground for
corporate advertisers.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are the most personal
intimate part of our psyche."

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:10%
As Robert Stickgold, Harvard
Medical School psychiatry

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:10%
professor and dream researcher
told The Hustle, quote,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:10%
"All night long, your brain
is reprocessing memories

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:10%
from the previous
day, connecting them

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.440 align:middle line:10%
with other memories,
sifting through the residue

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:10%
to decide which ones to
keep and stabilizing them.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams are literally
creating who we are."

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:10%
