00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The United States military
announces a new task force

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.050 align:middle line:10%
to investigate
unidentified aircraft.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Plus, an increase in
UFO sightings this year.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The United States
military has announced

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.640 align:middle line:84%
the formation of a new
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:90%
taskforce.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
The task force's stated
purpose is to, quote,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
"improve its understanding
of, and gain insight into,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:90%
the nature and origins of UAPs.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The mission of the task
force is to detect, analyze,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and catalog UAPs that could
potentially pose a threat to US

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:90%
national security."

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The government and
military's knowledge of UFOs

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:84%
has been kept in
secrecy for years.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
But why are we
hearing about it now?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:10%
>> What we're dealing with
is appropriations for exotic

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:10%
weapons of some kind to be used
later on with the excuse that

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:10%
there could be a national
security card-- in other words,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:10%
that we could be
facing a new enemy.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we must remember what Carol
Rosin said at the National

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Press Club in 2000.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
She said that Wernher
von Braun, who

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
was the rocket scientist
that worked at NASA,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
said that when we
ran out of enemies--

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that's communism,
terrorism, and so forth--

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that the last wild
card that would be used

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:90%
was the alien invasion card.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking it isn't because
somebody in the government

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
wants disclosure of any kind.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who have been
in the field for a long time

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
know that the government
knew about all these things

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:90%
way back when.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But when someone
decides to come forth,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
then there's an
agenda behind it.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Is this a step towards
government disclosure?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> People think that the UFO
knowledge has been secret.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
If it's out like it is in the
"New York Times" and so forth,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and these new groups
are being formed,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.440 align:middle line:90%
there's an agenda behind.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It isn't-- I don't
believe, personally--

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
this is my opinion--
that it's for disclosure.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
It's for an agenda of some kind.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And what the real
story is is not

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
educating the general public.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Educating the
general public would

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:84%
be where I'm at, that this has
gone on for a long, long time.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And nothing terrible
has happened.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you come out
and say that we're

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
going to form these
task forces, including

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
some kind of Space
Force, that all of this

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
is a mere military
type of thinking.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Meantime, the National
UFO Reporting Center reports

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
an increase in UFO sightings
compared to the same time last

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:10%
Peter Davenport of the
UFO Reporting Center

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:10%
tells Gaia News this
is just raw data,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:10%
and some reports
should be discounted.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But even accounting
for natural phenomena,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
why are people seeing
more UFOs this year?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> People are home.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
They're not at
their usual routine.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get more sightings.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They were probably there anyway,
but we never noticed them.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
this is a timing issue.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned in the research
that everything is timing.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And these sightings that are
out there are, I think, mainly

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:90%
just to get our attention.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:10%
>> An Ipsos poll taken earlier
this year shows almost half

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:10%
of Americans agree that UFOs
exist and have visited Earth,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:10%
and 57% think there
is intelligent life

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:10%
and civilizations
on other planets.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The way I look at the
phenomena is that it's to be

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:10%
studied.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:10%
So if we get scientists
and we get psychologists,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:10%
and we get people interested
in this phenomenon--

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:10%
because it is a social
science phenomenon--

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:10%
then maybe, just
maybe, we'll have

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:10%
a real interesting
dialogue in the future.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:10%
I think people should
look at the fact

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:10%
that Project Blue Book came
out, that scientists are coming

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:10%
at, that Jacques Vallee is
speaking in James Fox's movie,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:10%
"The Phenomenon."

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're going to
have to look at films.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to look
at films and film networks

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
to get our information--

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and not look at it
as entertainment,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:90%
but look at it as education.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> As more people begin to wake
up to the world around them,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
will we see disclosure
in our lifetime?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:90%
We'll be watching the skies.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
