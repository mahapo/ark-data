>> Exciting new scientific
research is finally showing

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410 align:middle line:10%
the efficacy of an
age-old practice--

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:10%
biofield healing.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.381 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Humans have been
using various forms

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of energy healing for eons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, the emerging field
of biofield medicine

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is ushering in serious
scientific inquiry.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Shamini Jain is a
researcher and founder

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:10%
of the Consciousness
and Healing Initiative,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:10%
a collaborative of leading
scientists and practitioners

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:10%
seeking to expand understandings
of biofield healing.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.278 align:middle line:10%
She is the author of the new
book, "Healing Ourselves".

00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The biofield is a new term
that's been coined by Western

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:10%
scientists to explain what
really is a very age-old

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
concept that aligns across
traditions around the world.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the biofield
is really a set of fields.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a set of interpenetrating
and interacting

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
fields of energy and information
that connect us and heal us.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So we can talk about and
explore the biofield of a cell,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the biofield of a person,
even the biofield of a tree,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:90%
or the biofield of the Earth.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
cool about it is we

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
can look at these interactions
between our biofields.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the
biofields between cells.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the
biofields between us.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at the biofields
between us and the Earth.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out when
we start exploring

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
those things in science, we
learn about healing effects.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We learn how our
connection actually heals.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Cyndi Dale is an energy
healer and intuitive who has

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
been working with the biofield
subtle energies for decades.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, energy is
information that moves.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, Einstein said it forever
ago everything is energy.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of how
measurable or not measurable

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So these days, we've subdivided
those types of energy

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
into subtle energy, which
is 99.999% of an object

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:84%
or of a person, versus
so-called physical energy, which

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
is really simply denser energy.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're increasingly being able
to measure subtle energy, which

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:90%
is really, really exciting.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we're explaining
it in terms of quantum physics

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
because subtle energy is
really most like quantum,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
which are the
smallest units, not

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
just of matter but of energy.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.383 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, some of the
quantum wave particles

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
can move faster than
the speed of light.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But they all carry
information or data.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Biofield healing can take
various forms of working with

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
These include Reiki,
acupuncture, healing touch,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and chronic healing
amongst others.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are now
looking at ways

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
in which this healing
might work right

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.195 align:middle line:90%
down to the cellular level.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We're
bioelectromagnetic beings.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Even our bones are piezoelectric
and our cells give off charge.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out, we can
actually even manipulate,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better term, work
with the charge in our cells

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.183 align:middle line:90%
to grow new neural tissue.

00:03:22.183 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
We have chemicals that
run around in the body.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns
out in, many cases,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
it's actually the
electromagnetic charge

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that might drive the chemicals
to move from one cell

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So as we begin to
explore the biofield,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:90%
there's so much to learn.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
How does energy
get under the skin?

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:90%
The research shows that it does.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, from a
scientific point of view,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
we still don't really
have the answers.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.061 align:middle line:90%
We need to find out.

00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> While much still remains to
be discovered about the exact

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.680 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms by which
biofield healing works,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
emerging research is
showing that it does.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:10%
Studies have shown the
efficacy of biofield therapies

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:10%
in dramatically reversing
fatigue in breast cancer

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:10%
survivors, improving immune
function in patients receiving

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:10%
chemotherapy, and reducing
PTSD symptoms in active duty

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:10%
military.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the most cutting edge
work that's being done right

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
now with biofield therapies
in terms of how they affect us

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
on the cellular level is being
done at MD Anderson Cancer

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Center under the direction
of Dr. Lorenzo Cohen.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:10%
They found that in fact
healing, bioenergetic healing,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:10%
could reduce tumors in
a mouse model of cancer.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> At the core of understanding
biofield healing is

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.865 align:middle line:90%
the connection to consciousness.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient systems of not
only spirituality but medicine

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
understood the fundamental
aspect of consciousness

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
for our health and healing.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
They're working
with consciousness,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
they're allowing for an
expansion of consciousness

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
not just in themselves
but also in the client

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%
that they're working with.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And through that expansion
of consciousness,

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
the field begins
to expand as well.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
As the field expands, what we
call in our tradition samskaras

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
or vasanas, habit patterns,
karmic attachments, these sorts

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
of things, they begin
to show themselves

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
as those begin to
be let go, energy

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
comes back into the system.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
As those blockages begin
to remove themselves,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see healing on the
emotional, mental, and physical

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Proponents of biofield
science are excited about

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
the future of the field and
passionate about the need

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.215 align:middle line:84%
for more rigorous
scientific study.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>> When we start investing
in biofield science,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see new solutions
for regenerative medicine.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see new solutions
for mental and physical health

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
epidemics because the central
understanding of the biofield

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:90%
is that we are truly connected.
