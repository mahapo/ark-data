00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
June 1960, astrophysicist
Freeman Dyson published

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:84%
his article, "Search for
Artificial Stellar Sources

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of Infrared Radiation,"
and the journal, "Science."

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
In it, he argued a way to
detect intelligent life

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
in the universe by finding
their energy signature that

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
would be created
by, he presumed,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:90%
a highly advanced technology.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, "if extraterrestrial
intelligent beings exist

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and have reached a high level
of technical development,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
one byproduct of their
energy metabolism

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
is likely to be the large-scale
conversion of starlight

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:90%
into far infrared radiation."

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Freeman Dyson, who died one
year ago this month at age 96,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
believed that an
advanced technology

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:84%
would harness solar
power from a star

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:90%
with an array of solar panels.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
He explained in a 2003
interview that he once

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:90%
described it as a biosphere.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
But since then, this theory has
been known as a Dyson sphere.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Seth Shostak,
senior astronomer

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.038 align:middle line:90%
at the SETI Institute explains.

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're looking for
an ET, if you're looking

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.902 align:middle line:10%
for intelligence
elsewhere in the universe,

00:01:33.902 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
you've got to figure there are
societies out there that are

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:10%
way more advanced than we are.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the universe has
been around for a long time.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And they may have
constructed something

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
like Dyson sphere or
perhaps more accurately,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
a Dyson Swarm, or something
that we could see.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So there have
actually been searches

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:90%
for alien Dyson spheres.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But it would not
necessarily be a sphere at all.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You could consider a Dyson
sphere as being sort of like

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:90%
a landscape, right.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
You got this bulb.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But imagine putting a
lampshade around it,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
maybe a lampshade that
covered the bulb from almost

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:90%
any angle you looked at.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that would collect all
the light coming off the bulb.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of it would get
through the lampshade.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the part
that you might want

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:90%
to use to read, for example.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same idea.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
You just want to put
something around the star.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
completely enclose it.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> So we find a Dyson sphere.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
That leads us to an alien
civilization, right?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out,
it's not that easy.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not clear that you could
actually see a Dyson sphere.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to begin with, if
it's a complete Dyson sphere,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
completely encircling the star,
you won't see anything, right?

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you know, it'll be dark.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It's blocking the
light from that star.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
a Dyson sphere,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
is that yeah, the
star's on the inside,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
but the outside of the
sphere or the swarm,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:90%
will also get a little bit warm.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:90%
That's just thermodynamics.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:10%
And when it gets warm, it
emits infrared radiation.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:10%
So essentially, all
the attempts to find

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:10%
these things have
relied on this fact

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:10%
and looked for
star systems where

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:10%
there's too much infrared
radiation coming from the star.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's an indication
that they have at least

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:90%
a partial Dyson sphere.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the large amount
of material in the universe,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
how do you tell a real Dyson
sphere from a false lead?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the problem with finding
Dyson spheres by just measuring

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
the so-called infrared excess
of a star, in other words,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
the degree to which the stars
pumping out lots of infrared,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
problem with that is, there's
another source of infrared

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
in the cosmos that
we know about.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's called dust.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Dust actually gets heated up
by any star that it's close to.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And that heat,
it's not very warm.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you wouldn't burn
your hand on anything,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's just warm,
like room temperature,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:90%
body temperature, whatever.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:90%
But that emits infrared light.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You think of the
night vision goggles

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.652 align:middle line:90%
that the military uses, right.

00:04:21.652 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for infrared.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can find
people that way,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
because people are
warm, 98.6 right.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But dust produces
infrared too, and there's

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:90%
a lot of dust in the universe.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:90%
A lot of star systems have dust.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if you just
find too much infrared,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
well, is it a Dyson sphere or is
it just some dust in that star

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to
tell the difference.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Alien or not, what could
we learn from this technology?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Dyson spheres
seem like a really,

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:10%
a universally good idea in
the sense that any society,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:10%
eventually, it's going to run
up against the limitations

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:10%
on the energy resources it
has on its own planet, right?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
We're already beginning to look
for other sources of energy.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you talk about wind power,
solar power, all these things.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're cleaner,
so they're attractive.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the
best source of energy

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
would be to capture more
of the sun's output.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the sun's shining
up there and that light

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:90%
is just going out into space.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't do anybody
any good, most of it.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of it
actually hits the Earth,

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
causes plants to grow
and that sort of thing.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
If you could even just
double the amount of energy

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that you capture
from the sun, that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
would be adequate to
supply humanity well,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
for a very long
time, if not forever.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:90%

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
