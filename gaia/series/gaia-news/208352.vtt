>> The study of cymatics
has fascinated researchers

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.240 align:middle line:10%
for years.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Now one scientist has
found a practical way

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to use the phenomenon to enhance
targeted cancer treatments.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.215 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:10%
The study of cymatics, or the
spontaneous geometric patterns

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:10%
produced by sound when it
encounters water or particulate

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:10%
matter on a surface, was coined
by Swiss researcher Hans Jenny

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:10%
in 1967.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:10%
Jenny documented
the patterns that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:10%
appeared when putting sand or
fluid on a metal plate that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:10%
was connected to a sonic
frequency oscillator.

Today, acoustic-physics
scientist John Stuart Reid

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:10%
has partnered with
Doctor Sungchul

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:10%
Ji at Rutgers University
to apply cymatic imaging

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:10%
to identify cancer cells
compared to healthy cells.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The two hope to
develop this technology

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:84%
to allow surgeons the ability
to more precisely target

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
cancerous cells when
removing tumors.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:10%
>> So what we do with the
CymaScope instrument is

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:10%
to literally imprint sound
onto the surface and, indeed,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:10%
the subsurface of pure
medical grade water,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:10%
and thereby make it visible with
specific lighting techniques.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:10%
It's actually quite
difficult for a surgeon

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:10%
to remove a tumor
in its entirety.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:10%
>> While this type of technology
would aid any procedure

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
requiring a surgical
removal of a tumor,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:10%
it would be particularly
groundbreaking for brain

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:10%
surgery and other highly
sensitive areas in which

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:10%
healthy cells must be
carefully navigated.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So what do cancer cells look
like compared to healthy cells?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:10%
>> What we found was that the
sounds of cancer cells are

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.950 align:middle line:10%
generally fairly
skewed and, well,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:10%
I would call them
subjectively ugly.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the sounds
from healthy cells,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
generally, the
sounds are harmonic.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, the
patterns that are created,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:10%
these cymatic patterns, are
very symmetrical by comparison.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And as the cell
has a respiration,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:84%
it's literally making
sound all of the time.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of our cells are
singing all of the time.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
really interesting

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to know that they're singing
in the audible spectrum.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, if we
could hear those sounds,

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
well, it would actually
drive us nuts, wouldn't it?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably just as
well that we can't hear them.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
However, they are literally
in the audible spectrum.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a question of
having specific tools that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.980 align:middle line:84%
allow us to listen
in to those sounds

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and then amplify those sounds
so that we can then hear them.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> As Reid and his colleagues
continue to develop

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
the CymaScope for
targeted cancer surgery,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
they are also looking into a
number of other applications

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
for the technology across
multiple scientific

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:90%
disciplines.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We are at the very
beginning, you could say,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of this new revolution in
science in terms of making

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
sound visible.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's extremely important
because sound actually

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
underpins virtually
every science.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if you think
of biology even, all

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
of the biochemical
reactions that

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
are occurring in our
body all of the time,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
they're all based on
sound if you think of it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
from the atomic viewpoint.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So being able to
make sound visible

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is a really wonderful way
of gaining new insights

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:90%
into almost every science.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:10%
