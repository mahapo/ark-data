The effects of mindfulness
on psychiatric patients

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.300 align:middle line:10%
and the pursuit of happiness--

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:10%
can we teach ourselves
how to be happier?

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News breakdown.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:10%
The term, "mindfulness,"
has entered popular culture

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:10%
in recent years, but this
ancient Buddhist practice

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:10%
actually began
gaining acceptance

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
in Western medicine
in the 1970s.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
In a recent article for
"Psychiatric Times,"

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
researchers looked at how
mindfulness-based treatments

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
work for psychiatric patients
and how these therapies can

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
enhance and even replace
pharmaceutical interventions.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:10%
They found a wealth
of evidence that

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:10%
mindfulness-based therapies have
overwhelmingly positive effects

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:10%
for patients, with
mindfulness-based cognitive

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.360 align:middle line:10%
therapy, reducing the
rate of relapse rates

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:10%
for patients with
major depression,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:10%
similar to that of
pharmaceuticals.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They also showed reduced
anxiety, reduced depression,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:90%
and increased cognition.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The researchers
recommend implementing

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness-based therapies
in place of or in concert

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
with pharmacotherapy,
especially as the population

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
grows older and cognitive
issues become more common.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:10%
What makes us truly happy?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:10%
Fame?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
Fortune?

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.170 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
True happiness may be
closer than you think.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And a recent study shows
we can learn to be happier.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most famous
study of happiness,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
the Harvard Study of Adult
Development, began in 1938,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and studied students
at Harvard University

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and coupled with another study
of kids from Boston's poorest

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
neighborhoods
throughout their lives

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and remains the longest running
longitudinal study of happiness

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and life satisfaction.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The main takeaway--
happiness and satisfaction

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
was not based on wealth
or fame or power,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
but on strong friendships
and relationships.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, we're
often more secluded.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Social media friends
are not real friends.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Computers take us away
from human contact.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
When we compare our lives
to the curated lifestyles

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.120 align:middle line:84%
we see on the internet, it
often makes us depressed.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But there is a way
to help cure that.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:10%
Just ask Laurie Santos,
professor of psychology

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:10%
at Yale University.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:10%
She teaches the
free online course,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:10%
The Science of
Well-Being, a class

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:10%
on increasing happiness and
ways to deal with habits

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:10%
that can make us unhappy.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
As she told "NewScientist,"
quote, "For many of us,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
our happiness is much more under
our control than we think."

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
These controls include
practicing mindfulness,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the use of gratitude
journals, which

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
can help us avoid
hedonic adaption,

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:84%
talking to strangers, which
can increase social connection,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing when we are
comparing ourselves to others

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and shifting our focus
to something positive.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
These tactics can be
significant and long lasting.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
A recent study
conducted by Santos

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
showed people who took
the 10-week Science

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of Well-Being class
compared to people

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
who took a general
psychology course were

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
significantly happier and
for a longer period of time.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Santos concludes that
courses like hers

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:10%
are, quote, "A public
health tool that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.210 align:middle line:10%
could be used to improve mental
health in the population."

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And as George Vaillant,
director of the Harvard

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
study for three
decades, once wrote,

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:90%
"Happiness is love, full stop."

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:90%
