using sound to facilitate
brainwave entrainment to heal

the body and expand the mind in
the second part of our special

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:10%

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.045 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:84%
In part 1 of this
investigation, we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
explored the science
of sound healing

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and new innovations in
frequency delivery methods

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
that stimulate the
body's innate healing

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.530 align:middle line:90%
and awakening capacities.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jeffrey Thompson is
a pioneering sound healer

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
who, over four decades,
has developed a number

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:90%
of advanced acoustic tools.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Using sound in order to do
something to change my state

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness has been
around for a long time.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:10%
I mean, every culture's
got their sound tradition,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:10%
and all those traditions have
to do with helping me wake up,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:10%
deepening my meditation,
cutting corners so I

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
don't have to spend 30 years.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I can do it in 10.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the tools
that we've got, with EEG

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and binaural beats and
sophisticated digital

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
equipment, we've got a
precision that nobody's ever

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
seen before to awaken the
deepest part of who I am.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Another high-tech tool
utilizes the practice

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of brainwave entrainment to
target specific brain waves

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
One area of emerging research
is around an extremely slow

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:84%
brainwave frequency found in a
region in the brain consisting

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of four zones.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Together, these are called
the default mode network.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> 95% of all brain function
is this default mode under

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
the hood, and 5% off the top
is you and me in our regular

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
world, thinking that's
the whole thing.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And how they describe
that is mind wandering,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
wool gathering, a
visualization, holographic,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
number-crunching consolidation
of information from my senses.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the quantum
computer reality generator.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
When those four
zones start to come

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
unsynchronized to
any degree, we've

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
got a host of
neurological conditions.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
ADD, ADHD, dyslexia, autism,
epilepsy, Parkinson's,

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's, depression, PTSD--

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
all of these conditions
are associated directly

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
with the desynchronizing
of these four zones.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Synchronizing the brain
is exactly what I do.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, I need
four binaural beats--

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
two of them for these two
zones, and two of them,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:84%
rotated in three
dimensional space,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
to line up with these two zones.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing
this with my clinical work,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was just
another profound tool.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden, the results
were now accelerated.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to showing
great promise in treating

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
neurological disorders, this
default-mode brain entrainment

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
also seems to facilitate
consciousness expansion

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
in healthy individuals.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
This is thought to
result from the function

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
of the different
zones of the network

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to give rise to sense
of self and time.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Thompson's work consists of
hypersyncing these four zones

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.670 align:middle line:84%
together through
binaural beat entrainment

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
to produce profound effects.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Extremely high states of
meditation associated with

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
hypersynchronizing
of the four zones--

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.800 align:middle line:84%
cosmic consciousness
experiences,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
transcendental meditation,
things like that.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
If I have my sense
of self on the inside

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
of my skin versus the outside
of my skin synchronizing

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
more and more and more, that
boundary starts to get funky.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It starts to get amorphous.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon,
I can't quite tell

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
where the inside of my skin
ends and the universe begins.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I begin to get a perception
that the inside of my skin

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
is universally large.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
That's cosmic
consciousness, right?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
My sense of the
present moment begins

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to expand out into all
past and future events.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:90%
That's cosmic consciousness.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:10%
So now, all of a sudden we've
got a new, super high-tech

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:10%
meditation tool.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Another fascinating
innovation is group sound

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:10%
healing.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, we have a thousand
people sitting in a circle,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
holding hands.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I split two people apart and
put my heart rate variability

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
sense and I get the group entity
of that group, and I tune that.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.215 align:middle line:84%
And I take the group
voice chanting.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to listen
with headphones, everybody.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to entrain
to a very precise brain

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.258 align:middle line:84%
frequency that is unique
and specific for this group.

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to entrain
everybody's brainwaves

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
to exactly and precisely
the same place.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
But when I've calculated this
frequency on a screen that I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
can see this is happening, and
I calculate down the octaves

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
until I identify an octave
theta brain frequency--

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
that's where
creativity happens--

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to entrain
this group to theta,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.553 align:middle line:84%
because I'm trying to boost
creativity in problem-solving.

00:05:13.553 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going
to listen to headphones,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
so this is going to happen
where problem solving happens.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Theta is going to be
where creativity happens.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And everybody listening
to a tone for the group

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
together, activating a deep
unconscious recognition

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
pattern of the group voice, is
as scientific as I know to get.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> For Dr. Thompson, the
implications of this group

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:90%
entrainment are far-reaching.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We need a critical number
of mass of people with heavy

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, high
levels of understanding,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to link their brainwaves
exactly and precisely together

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
by science of sound, to exactly
precisely the same state.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Which means it's
a visualization.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.192 align:middle line:90%
It's from here.

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not from here;
it's from here.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
power is, not here.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And I can entrain to
here, and I can entrain

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:90%
large groups of people to here.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:84%
We are in a unique
position as human beings

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
change reality itself

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
at a quantum field level.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
We just have to be crazy
enough to give it a try.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:10%
