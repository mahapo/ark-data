00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Emotional Freedom
Techniques, or EFT,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is a powerful
self-healing practice

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
which seeks to address
psychological issues by working

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
with energy channels
in the body.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Also known as
tapping, it combines

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:84%
modern psychological
therapies with ancient healing

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:10%
Specifically, EFT
incorporates the principles

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:10%
of acupressure, which involves
the application of pressure

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:10%
to specific points in the body
thought for thousands of years

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:10%
to clear blockages along
energy channels or meridians.

Doctor Dawson Church is a
health and science writer

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:10%
who has been
researching, practicing,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:10%
and teaching EFT for decades.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>> EFT's history goes
back thousands of years.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have
discovered mummies

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:10%
from Europe that are 5,000 years
old with these tapping points

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:10%
tattooed on their bodies.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:10%
And acupressure is simply
pressure on acupuncture points.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:10%
Like we would normally
use needling on them,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:10%
instead we use pressure,
and one fingertip

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:10%
tapping on those points.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:10%
What we do with EFT
is we simply organize

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:10%
several of the most potent
points of acupuncture

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:10%
into a little ritual so
you can remember to tap.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And the research shows that
if you take somebody who's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
stressed, the emotional
brain, the central part

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the limbic
system, is highly active.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
When you have them tap while
remembering a painful incident,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
it simply calms the brain
down in a few seconds.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what is the
mechanism at work here?

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> We are energy beings.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
We may be physical
beings on the outside.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But we have
electrons and protons

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and neutrons and photons and all
kinds of energy in our bodies.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Energy flows to the body, and
it flows in these channels.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
When we tap on our
acupressure points,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
that produces a calming
piezoelectric signal.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It travels through
our connective tissue

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.066 align:middle line:84%
to the source of distress,
and rapidly calms it down.

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Recent research has
shown that EFT is remarkably

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
effective for addressing
psychological issues,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
such as depression and anxiety,
and is especially helpful

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.232 align:middle line:84%
in cases of emotional
trauma and PTSD.

00:02:40.232 --> 00:02:43.195 align:middle line:84%
>> When you tap, it
shifts your energy flows.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:90%
It shifts your brain.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And you start to release
all that emotion.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're now remembering all
of the bad stuff of your life.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're giving your brain
two conflicting signals.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:90%
The one signal is freak out.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Get stressed.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember the car crash.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Remember going to war.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Remember the explosion.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Remember the terrible divorce.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Remember the horrible fight.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, your emotional
brain is getting one signal

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
from your memory, which is
go into fight or flight.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's getting a
second conflicting signal

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
from acupressure,
which is, you're OK.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:90%
You survived.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're correcting your
energy flows right now.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
When faced with those two
mutually exclusive signals,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the brain prioritizes the
physical signal of safety.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you
can remember the event.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:90%
You recall the event still.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
You no longer have
an emotional reaction

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to the event, which is why
we call it emotional freedom

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Given the high rates of
PTSD in military veterans,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:10%
Doctor Church has done a
great deal of work with this

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:10%
vulnerable population
with great success.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
In a recent study
of veterans, EFT

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.190 align:middle line:84%
was found to have a profound
effect on participants' genes.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most exciting new
fields of science is looking

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
at these tiny molecules
called microRNAs.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And they stick to genes.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
If they adhere to genes,
they silence those genes.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And that silencing can have
effects on both your body

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:90%
and your mind.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We did one study of
veterans, and these veterans

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.412 align:middle line:90%
got 10 EFT sessions.

00:04:18.412 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
We looked at their
gene expression.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We found that they had
increased expression

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
of genes that suppress
inflammation and boost

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:90%
immunity.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So these veterans were having an
epigenetic effect from tapping.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
We looked deeper
at the microRNAs.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And we found that there
are little microRNAs that

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
are associated with depression.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
If these microRNAs are
sticking to the genes,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely
to be depressed.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.040 align:middle line:84%
In that study, we found those
microRNAs literally popping off

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
the genes as the
levels of depression

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
in those veterans lifted.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Another fascinating recent
study looked at the effects

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of EFT on various
physiological markers,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.148 align:middle line:84%
including those having
to do with immunity.

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We've done several
studies of EFT immunity.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And in one of them,
we found that people

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
meditating and
tapping for a week

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:90%
had a dramatic drop in cortisol.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, when cortisol
drops, all kinds

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of positive things
in the body rise.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And the thing we measured that
rose the most was a molecule

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
called immunoglobulin.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it protects you against
bacteria and viruses.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We found that levels
of immunoglobulins

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
in just one week of meditation
and tapping rose by 113%.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> While the tapping technique
can be learned through various

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
online resources, Doctor Church
cautions that those dealing

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
with serious emotional trauma
should work with a trained

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:90%
professional.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
For Doctor Church, the
implications of EFT

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
are far reaching.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> As we deploy these
psychological techniques,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
psychological therapies widely,
we're going to see massive

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
drops in anxiety,
depression, PTSD, phobias,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
and other forms of stress.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And that will produce
an enormous liberation

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of human potential because
if people aren't then

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
functioning with all those
epigenetic emotional and

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
physical weights on
their lives, they

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
will then become the people
that they were meant to be.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're at the beginning of
a huge shift in mental health

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
now just as we were
at the beginning

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of a huge shift in physical
health a century ago.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And that change will produce
massive shifts globally.
