>> As rates of mental health
issues in teens reach epidemic

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.770 align:middle line:84%
proportions, a new intervention
that reframes the way they view

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.710 align:middle line:84%
stressors shows great
promise and improving both

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:84%
physiological and
psychological health.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.918 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Given the exponentially
growing mental health crisis

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.220 align:middle line:84%
among teens, the
American Academy

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of Pediatrics, along with
several other medical

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
organizations, recently
declared a national emergency

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
in children's mental health.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:84%
While many societal factors
are being implicated,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
researchers at the
University of Rochester

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
recently conducted a
study which focused

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:84%
on the ordinary day-to-day
stresses that teens face,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
such as how they are
perceived by others.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
While these social evaluative
stressors, many originating

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:84%
from social media,
can lead directly

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
to depression and
anxiety, it is how

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
teens deal with
them, experts say,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:84%
that determines the
psychological outcome.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
While conventional thinking
equates stress with something

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
bad, psychologist
Jeremy Jamieson,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
who headed up the study,
told the University

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
of Rochester News
Center, quote, "stress

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
is a normal and even defining
feature of adolescence.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
For those of us who study
processes and psychophysiology,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
stress is just any
demand for change.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:90%
It's neither good nor bad."

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And when teens avoid
stress, experts say,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:84%
they lose out on the
opportunity to grow

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
from the unavoidable
situations that cause it.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The intervention developed by
Jamieson and his colleagues

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
was informed by the idea
that how we respond to stress

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
can either lead to mental
health issues or to resilience.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Consisting of a
self-administered 30-minute

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
online training module,
the intervention

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
works by helping teens
develop what researchers

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:90%
call synergistic mindsets.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The first is a
growth mindset, which

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that one's
intelligence can be developed

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
in response to a challenge.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The other is what
the researchers call

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
a stress-can-be-enhancing
mindset.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the idea that one's
physiological stress responses,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
such as sweaty palms and racing
heart, are not only not harmful

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:84%
but can actually enhance
one's performance

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:90%
in challenging situations.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Researchers administer
the intervention

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
to a large group of adolescents
and found that it dramatically

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
improved biological responses,
psychological well-being,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and academic performance.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Given how simple
the intervention is,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
researchers see huge potential
in large-scale implementation

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
and are planning further trials.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The key takeaway, says Jamieson,
is that this approach is about,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
quote, "teaching people about
how stress can be useful.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
That's a really big novel
idea for a lot of people.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Stress is typically
not seen as something

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that is beneficial
and adaptive, it's

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
seen as something
that's damaging.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We're really trying to work
against that misconception."
