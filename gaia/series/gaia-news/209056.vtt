made it easier to report UFOs,

possibly releasing people from
non-disclosure agreements.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Will this open the
floodgates of information?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The US government just made
it easier to report UFOs,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
possibly releasing people from
non-disclosure agreements.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
As part of the annual defense
spending bill, the National

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Defense Authorization
Act for 2023,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the House just
approved an Amendment

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:84%
that would make it easier
for current or former members

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
of the military,
government-employed civilians,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and contractors to report UFOs,
or UAPs, as the government now

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:90%
calls them.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
The measure was sponsored
by Reps Mike Gallagher

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of Wisconsin and Ruben
Gallego of Arizona,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
who have been among those
in Congress calling for more

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:90%
transparency into UFOs.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The amendment would
create a secure system

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:84%
for reporting any UFO
phenomenon and protect

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
those who come forward
from any repercussions.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Representative Gallagher
told Politico, quote,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
"I believe it's possible
that folks may be precluded

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
from being fully
transparent with Congress

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
due to their being bound by
nondisclosure agreements.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, I want
to make sure there's

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
no technical reason preventing
them from speaking to us."

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The amendment would
establish a dedicated system

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to report, quote,
"any event relating

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to unidentified
aerial phenomenon

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and any government or government
contractor activity or program

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
related to unidentified
aerial phenomena."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So not only does it require
a report on UAP encounters

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
but also a report on
what was done about it.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Further, the Amendment
requires a review

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
by the inspectors general
number less than one year

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:90%
after enactment.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
To confirm, the appropriate
actions have been taken

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and confirm compliance
with the new system.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:10%
Luis Elizondo, whistleblower
and former director

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:10%
of the Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.660 align:middle line:10%
reportedly told Politico
the amendment was,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:10%
"one of the greatest
efforts in recent history

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:10%
to foster transparency
on this topic,"

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and added, "this legislation
may open the floodgates."

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:84%
All of this comes
about two months

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
after the first public hearing
on UFOs in more than 50 years.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we have recently
reported, some on Capitol Hill

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
have not been impressed
by the lackluster response

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
from national security agencies.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Meantime, the
Senate is reportedly

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
working their own similar
version of this Bill

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that would also offer amnesty
to anyone coming forward

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
with any information on UFOs.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
