00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:84%
The psychedelic revolution
in mental health

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
has produced overwhelming
scientific evidence,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating the great
efficacy of psychedelics

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and the treatment of various
mental health disorders.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, several new studies
involving the drugs ketamine

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and MDMA are showing
significant promise

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:90%
in the treatment of alcoholism.

Dr. Ben Sessa is a psychiatrist
and chief medical officer

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:10%
at Awakn Life Sciences, a
British biotech company that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:10%
is at the forefront of research,
development, and delivery

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelic medicines.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:10%
The company is
especially focused

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:10%
on the treatment of alcohol
use disorder or AUD,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.020 align:middle line:10%
given how prevalent and
challenging it is to treat.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Addiction is a huge
public health problem.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:10%
It's also a
psychiatric condition

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:10%
that's very poorly treated
with very poor outcomes

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
with traditional methods.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Relapse to drinking
after getting dry

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:10%
is around 80% to
90% at 12 months.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:10%
That's an embarrassingly
poor statistic.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Psychedelics offer a
completely new approach.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:10%
They offer the patient
the opportunity

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:10%
to explore the root
causes of addiction,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:10%
which so often is trauma.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is an intensive
upfront piece of work

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.900 align:middle line:84%
that gets the patient
better so they

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:90%
don't have to keep coming back.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a completely
different paradigm shift

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to the way we currently
manage patients

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:90%
in maintenance therapies.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> A recent study conducted by
researchers at the University

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of Exeter and Awakn Life
Sciences is the world's first

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to examine the use of ketamine
to treat AUD in a randomized

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:90%
controlled trial.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Ketamine is a very
well-established human

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It is one of-- it is,
indeed, the only psychedelic

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that's licensed as a medicine,
as an anesthetic medicine,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and has been used
since the '60s as such.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's an incredibly
safe medicine.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
When it's used at
a much lower dose,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
it produces an altered
state of consciousness.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we do in
psychedelic-assisted

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy with ketamine
is we use this altered state

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to affect
more effective and deeper form

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:90%
of psychotherapy.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're using
ketamine as an adjunct

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to psychotherapy to
treat addictions.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Participants in the
study had all just completed

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:10%
a medically-supervised
alcohol detox program.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Those in the experimental
group received treatment

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
with both ketamine and
a form of psychotherapy

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
called care over the
course of four weeks.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
The results were astounding.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The group that received
ketamine and specific care

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy led to an 86%
abstinence rate at six months.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, blows
out of the water

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the current best
treatments for alcoholism.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what accounts for
these astounding results?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So we know a fair bit about
the mode of action of ketamine.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You literally grow new brain
tissue after taking ketamine.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now this is hugely
helpful because when

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
you combine that-- if you think
of it as a sort of super, ripe,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
brain bristling with
new neuronal activity

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and you combine that with
psychotherapy in which you are

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
asking the patient to address
the psychological issues,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
usually around stuck,
rigid narratives they hold,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
then you can grow this new
neural tissue in the direction

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
you want to have changes
to their psychology.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge
breakthrough for addictions,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
which are so much about
rigidity and stuckness.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The implications of this
groundbreaking study are truly

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:90%
profound.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Once we get the drug
actually licensed and approved

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
for, specifically,
alcohol use disorder,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
it hugely broadens the
accessibility and far more

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
clinicians would be willing to
be using this in a much broader

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So it will really
radically change

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
the field of treatment of
alcoholism all over the world.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to their
work with ketamine,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Awakn has also recently
completed a study with another

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
psychoactive drug, MDMA, which
has yielded equally significant

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:90%
findings.
