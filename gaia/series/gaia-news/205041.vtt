A 1983 army intelligence

The Analysis and Assessment
of the Gateway Process details

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
the technique to reach higher
consciousness by sinking

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:90%
the hemispheres of the brain.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Declassified nearly 20
years ago by the CIA,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:10%
the report has suddenly
gained interest by TikTokers

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:10%
with more than a million
views and counting.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Many young TikTokers
are not only

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
sharing news of
the gateway process

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
but their experiences
trying to use it.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:90%
So what's the full story?

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:84%
Often mistakenly reported
as a CIA document,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
this decades-old
report was actually

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
written by an army
intelligence officer.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:10%
The Gateway Process, part
of the Gateway Program,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:10%
was run by Bob Monroe at
the Monroe Institute, which

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:10%
many remote viewers went through
as a part of their training.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
What was the objective
of the Gateway Program?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And how is it related
to remote viewing?

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
Retired US Army
Major Paul H. Smith

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:10%
spent seven years as a remote
viewer and remote viewing

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.965 align:middle line:10%
trainer, and completed
the Gateway Program.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Gateway Program, the
goal is just to kind of expand

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.115 align:middle line:10%
one's consciousness to
help these, I guess,

00:01:44.115 --> 00:01:45.990 align:middle line:10%
for want of a better
word, otherworldly kinds

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:10%
of experiences.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And remote viewing is a very
practical pragmatic thing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
where the viewer is expected
to obtain real information that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
can be verified and explain what
it is that they are perceiving

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:84%
in a way that it can be
used in some practical way.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:84%
The value of the
gateway process,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
they use this technology
known as Hemi-Sync

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
which allows one to
synchronize one's hemispheres,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.790 align:middle line:84%
essentially adopt a
certain specific state

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness as sort
of a state of relaxation.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was very helpful
in preparing a remote viewer

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
to actually go forth
and do whatever

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
their particular
assigned mission was.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.996 align:middle line:84%
So one was kind of an
adjunct for the other.

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> How does a person reach
a state of Hemi-Sync?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So the way Hemi-Sync works
is it plays two audio signals

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.982 align:middle line:90%
in either ear.

00:02:39.982 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:84%
One in this area, one in
this area, and they're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
a half step-out.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's an
acoustic signal but it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
generates electromagnetic
energy, electrochemical energy

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And the two
hemispheres, of course,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
come together at
a certain point.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Those two audio
signals, now turned

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
into an electrical
signal, meet in the middle

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and they set up that what
they call a beat frequency,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:90%
that warbly kind of sound.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can adjust it and the
brain starts following that.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And for example, you can go to
the 7.5 Hertz frequency, which

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is the theta range
in EEG, and you

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
can change those frequencies,
and it alters how the two

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.137 align:middle line:90%
hemispheres sink together.

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
synchronize and that's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.762 align:middle line:90%
why we call it Hemi-Sync.

00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So hemisphere
synchronization, right?

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really quite
remarkable technology.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the gateway process
and Hemi-Sync experience like?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of hard to
express what the experience

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
in a gateway program is without
actually having it yourself.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It's very subjective.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I was in a space with
no time for a while

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:84%
where everything
was illuminated.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I was able to actually went
back and experienced some points

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
in my life that I've
forgotten about.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.083 align:middle line:84%
I had this perception
of one of my colleagues

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
who I was working
with at the time

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and seem to be in perfectly good
health being in a hospital bed,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
all bundled up with
bandages around his chest,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and hooked up to
equipment all the stuff.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I just had this perception.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And a year and a
half later, this guy

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
had open heart surgery because
he had a sudden heart attack.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:90%
That, I wasn't expecting.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely have
this link, this perception

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
from December of 1983 to
the middle of 1985 that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.231 align:middle line:90%
matched what actually happened.

00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:39.902 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the benefits
of the gateway process?

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the years, the Hemi-Sync
technology which is the core

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of the gateway program, has
been used actually in a lot

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
of interest in ways.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It has shown some
ability to help people

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:90%
in healing and pain management.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
It's tended to show some success
in helping people become better

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.892 align:middle line:84%
learners, overcome some
learning disabilities,

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
that's been explored

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
just as like
consciousness-raising kind

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.082 align:middle line:90%
of a methodology as well.

00:05:07.082 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been nearly 20 years
since this document was

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:90%
declassified.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think there's
a sudden interest now?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This particular document
has really caught the attention

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and imagination of
a lot of people.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.442 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
couple of reasons for that.

00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:26.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it really explores
the nature of consciousness,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the nature of quantum
physics, and how

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it interacts with human
perception, human thought,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
and action.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
It explores how we might
engineer that in a way using

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
this Hemi-Sync technology.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And the real interesting
thing about this,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
it has some
credibility because it

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.857 align:middle line:84%
is something that came
out of the intelligence

00:05:48.857 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
community, it's something
that budget dollars paid for.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that makes it
real, actually real for people

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
to see this thing that the
government had something

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
to do with them
producing, and yet it

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
seems to be far afield of where
normally people's thoughts go

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.034 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream.

00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Having gone through
the gateway program,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
what did you find most
interesting about this report?

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> This author has really honed
in on a lot of the current

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
topics of conversation
concerning

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensionality,
concerning holographic nature,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
potentially the holographic
nature of the universe,

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, and how it
relates to quantum physics,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.887 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to realize this
is all speculative stuff.

00:06:42.887 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's
in the paper doesn't

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
mean it's absolutely true
because we don't know.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a guide, I guess, to try
and understand the universe.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And we'll find out
how true that is as we

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.638 align:middle line:90%
learn more things about it.

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It is unclear how
TikTokers found the document.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of a path
to higher consciousness,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
the holographic nature
of the universe,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%

might we learn about
