A new survey of decades of
compelling scientific evidence

it came from the sky

origins of civilization.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The Younger Dryas
is the name given

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.378 align:middle line:84%
to a geological period that
took place between 12,800

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:90%
and 11,500 years ago.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Marked by a suddenly
occurring mini ice age,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
this time was one of
environmental catastrophe,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
worldwide animal extinctions,
and major changes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:90%
in human culture and population.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
While researchers
have, for decades,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
been debating
various explanations

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
for these cataclysmic events,
one controversial hypothesis

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
now appears to be most
supported by evidence.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Martin Sweatman
is a scientist

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
at the University
of Edinburgh who

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:10%
recently completed a thorough
survey of this Younger Dryas

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:10%
impact hypothesis.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
>> There is now this
impact hypothesis which--

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:10%
well, this was
developed in two--

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:10%
first stated in 2007.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And it suggested that
this geological period,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
this mini ice age that
lasted 1,300 years,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
was triggered by a cosmic impact
with fragments of a comet.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And so since then--
since 2007, there's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of research
published either for

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and some against this idea.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And so my recent
paper was looking at

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and summarizing all of that
evidence for the impacts,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%
particularly.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The most compelling
scientific evidence is

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the geochemical debris found
in soil sediments examined all

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
over the planet, the only
feasible explanation for which

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is cosmic impact.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:10%
Another fascinating
line of evidence

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:10%
connects the impact to the
world's oldest temple--

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:10%
Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have this incredible
site, Gobekli Tepe,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
which is very anomalous.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't see anything like it
in the archaeological record

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't see
anything else like it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
for many thousands of
years afterwards, either.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So it suddenly appears
in all its complexity

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and all its high degree of
architecture and planning.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems very anomalous
that the people of that time

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
would have built
something like that.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.123 align:middle line:84%
And so in my mind
or the way I see

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
it is that something
must have happened.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.332 align:middle line:84%
Something dramatic
must have happened

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:50.648 align:middle line:84%
to motivate the construction
of Gobekli Tepe.

00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that,
of course, you've

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
got all the decoding, all the
interpretation of the symbols.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
You can interpret
the animal symbols

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe
as constellations.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And through interpreting
how these constellations are

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:84%
arranged, then when you
look at the altar stone,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
that pillar, you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
can interpret that as a date
written with constellations.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So the date that's written
on this pillar, it seems,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:84%
agrees very well with the date
of the Younger Dryas impact

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Other pillars of the temple
have been interpreted to show

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism by which
this event happened through

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
the repeated imagery
of foxes and snakes,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
which are thought to have
represented comets at that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins is an
ancient history researcher

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:10%
who first made this connection
in his 2014 book "Gobekli

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:10%
Tepe--

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:10%
Genesis of the Gods."

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Collins points out that the date
of Gobekli Tepe's construction

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:10%
coincides perfectly
with the date given

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:10%
by Plato for the
destruction of Atlantis.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
In his book, Collins also
presents his theories

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
about the motivation for
the building of the temple

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:90%
so soon after the impact event.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe being
constructed immediately after

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.895 align:middle line:10%
the end of the mini ice age that
accompanied the Younger Dryas

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:10%
event--

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.120 align:middle line:10%
there had to be a relationship.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It must have shattered
the human belief

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
in the powers of
nature and any beliefs

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:90%
that they had in their gods.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe may well have
been a response to this,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the shamans
of the hunter-gatherers

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
gathered together and basically
said to the local people, look,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
we can sort this out for you.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We can make sure that every time
these comets come into the sky,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with the
supernatural creatures

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that all seem to be
behind their presence,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
but we need your help.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And that help was to construct
these stone enclosures.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Martin Sweatman's ideas
are very much in accordance

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
with this line of thinking.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:10%
>> The impact event probably
created or caused people

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.960 align:middle line:10%
to invent or develop
a new religion,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:10%
which in the evidence we see
for that is at Gobekli Tepe.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And that religion caused
people to gather together,

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to settle together in
larger and larger numbers.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's then a
question of, well,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
how do you feed these
larger communities?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I suggest
that agriculture

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
was invented as a way
of supporting the larger

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:90%
communities.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So I see the
Younger Dryas impact

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
event as some kind
of catalyst or spark

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
for essentially the
origin of civilization.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> While further
research is underway,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to many experts it now appears
very clear that not only did

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic impact happen,
but that it gave birth

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:90%
to civilization as we know it.
