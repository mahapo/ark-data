00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:10%
One in five Americans
suffers from chronic pain,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:10%
most often without
receiving much benefit

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:10%
from invasive and
costly treatments.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The most common
type of chronic pain

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is chronic back pain
in 85% of cases,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
of which no physical
cause can be identified.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Yoni Ashar is a
clinical psychologist

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and neuroscientist, who studies
psychological treatments

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:10%
for chronic pain.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
He recently led a study at the
University of Colorado Boulder

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether a
psychological treatment can

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
eliminate chronic back pain,
something no other therapy

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:84%
has ever before been
scientifically proven to do.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Our society predominantly
thinks about chronic pain

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:10%
through a biomechanical
medical perspective.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The most common
treatments are physical,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
if they're injections
or physical therapy,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:90%
something targeting the body.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
learning more and more

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is that in many cases
of chronic pain,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
the problem lays in
the mind or the brain,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
and we now have, really,
decades of research,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
both in neuroscience and
medicine and psychology,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
showing that there
are a lot of changes

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that happen in the brain
during chronic pain.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And then in many
cases, these can

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.265 align:middle line:84%
cause the pain to persist
after an injury has healed.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>> An important distinction to
be made when discussing chronic

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
pain is between the two
types, primary and secondary.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> In secondary chronic pain,
the pain is secondary to some

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:90%
medical problem or disease.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
In primary pain, the pain
is the primary problem.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It is not secondary
to anything else,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and what really is driving
it is neuroplastic changes

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and
fear and avoidance.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Fear is at the heart
of chronic pain.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:90%
So pain is a danger signal.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental function of
pain is to guide a person

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
or an animal away from
things that are dangerous,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and when we perceive
things to be dangerous,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that can amplify or even
create this pain in our brains.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Ashar likens primary
chronic pain to a false alarm

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%
stuck in the "on" position.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
A technique called pain
reprocessing therapy,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or PRT, developed by pain
psychologist Alan Gordon,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:90%
seeks to silence the alarm.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> At the heart of PRT is
learning to think and feel

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
differently about your pain,
and what I mean by that is, one,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
thinking differently about
it, so understanding that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the causes of the pain
are non-dangerous,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:90%
reversible brain changes.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The pain is a sort
of a false alarm.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
While it's totally real, it's
due to these brain pathways

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that are firing that are
not accurately reflecting

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:90%
the state of the body.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The second piece of PRT is
learning to feel differently

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
about the pain, which
what I mean by that

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is learning not
to fear the pain.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And this happens on a
more emotional level,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
as well, but learning
to change some

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.430 align:middle line:84%
of these automatic clenching
and tightening around the pain,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
learning to relax
into it because you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:90%
know that it's safe.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In the University
of Colorado study,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
151 participants suffering from
chronic back pain underwent

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
four weeks of
treatment with PRT.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:90%
The results were extraordinary.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found was a really
large drop in pain intensity.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:10%
2/3 of people in
the PRT condition

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:10%
were pain free or nearly
so at post-treatment,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:10%
as compared to less
than 20% of controls.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So existing
psychological treatments,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
like CBT or acceptance
and commitment therapy,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.662 align:middle line:84%
generally aim to provide
modest pain reductions

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and help people live more
gracefully with their pain.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't really try
to eliminate the pain.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That's one key thing
that makes PRT different,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
is that PRT aims to
eliminate the pain because it

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
views the pain as being driven
by reversible brain processes.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So it can be unlearned.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers were thrilled to
find that the results held one

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
year after treatment.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
What are the implications
of these findings?

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What I believe we've been
able to do in this study is

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
take a similar treatment
approach and show,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
in a well-conducted study,
that it really works,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that you really can resolve
chronic pain with psychological

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
treatments.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:10%
The study shows that you
can unlearn that pain

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:10%
and be pain free or nearly so.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Thankfully, there are
numerous therapists who are

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:10%
trained in PRT and can
be readily found online.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
For researchers like
Dr. Ashar, this study

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
is a pivotal step towards change
in the existing paradigm of how

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
we approach pain and providing
hard, scientific evidence

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
of the power of our
minds to heal our bodies.
