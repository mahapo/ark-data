>> A groundbreaking new
study seeks to scientifically

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:10%
validate an ability we
may all be born with--

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.980 align:middle line:10%
clairvoyance.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.690 align:middle line:10%
Clairvoyance or the
ability to perceive

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
beyond the physical
sense of sight

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.440 align:middle line:10%
has been documented in almost
every culture across all time.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it, like other
psychic abilities,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
has often been feared,
misunderstood, and disbelieved.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:10%
Today an ever-growing interest
in extended perception

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:10%
has motivated researchers
to scientifically study

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.930 align:middle line:10%
the phenomenon.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.530 align:middle line:10%
Helane Wahbeh is the Director
of Research at the Institute

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:10%
of Noetic Sciences
or IONS, which

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:10%
investigates transcendent
human experiences

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:10%
through rigorous
scientific study.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Wahbeh and her team
recently conducted the study

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:90%
into clairvoyance.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Clairvoyance is
a historic term.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:10%
It's been used for
a very long time.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And it specifically
means clear seeing.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But, really, it is this
extended perception

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of being able to perceive beyond
our physical sense of sight.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
This shows up in
different ways for people.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Some people actually see colors.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They see supposed
other beings that

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:90%
don't have physical bodies.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:10%
Other people see in
their mind's eye.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:10%
So they might receive
information or visuals

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:10%
from other people,
from things around them

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:10%
that they wouldn't normally
be able to possibly know

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:10%
with their traditional
five senses.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Cyndi Dale is an energy
healer and intuitive who has

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:10%
experienced clairvoyant
abilities throughout her entire

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:10%
life.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>> So there are many, many
different ways that somebody

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:10%
can get a clairvoyant
image or vision.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways is
at night, in dreams.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're in color.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're
in black and white.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Some people get their visions
when they're daydreaming.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the pictures that
come in are more futuristic.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:90%
They're about predestiny.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
They're about something
that could happen.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Many times I find
that the visions

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
are really more about
history, what's occurred,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:90%
or what's happened.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Or they're psychological.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're explaining what is.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Being clairvoyant, which
I am, is complicated

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
just about receiving.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about how do you
work with the images.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
How do you interact with them?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> While many clairvoyants have
experienced these abilities

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
from birth, there are many
others who have developed

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the skill through training,
which begs the question,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:90%
is everyone clairvoyant?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Does everyone have the
capacity to receive information

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and energy from
beyond time and space?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I do believe everyone
has the capacity to do that.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the way that it
shows up for them is unique.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Using clairvoyance to obtain
verifiable information has been

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly demonstrated in
the forms of remote viewing

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and medical intuition.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.840 align:middle line:10%
The recent study at
IONS is the first design

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:10%
to validate whether
clairvoyant seers are

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:10%
able to accurately perceive
what occurs during an energy

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:10%
medicine session.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It is a follow-up
to an earlier study

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
IONS did with the
participation of one seer which

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:90%
yielded promising results.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:10%
As this experiment
incorporates multiple seers,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:10%
the researchers' hope is that
the findings will not only

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.420 align:middle line:10%
validate the practice
of clairvoyance

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:10%
but will also shed light on
how energy medicine works.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And we had these Reiki
masters giving 30-minute

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
sessions to people who had a
variety of different health

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And in that space, we had
six clairvoyant seers who

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:90%
were observing the sessions.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And the primary
research question

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is, what is the corroboration
between those six

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
seers in terms of what they were
observing during each session?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Our hypothesis is
that there will

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
be a corroboration
between them, thus,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
validating this experience
of clairvoyant seeing.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers just finished
data collection and are working

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:90%
on the findings.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
In this study and others
being planned at IONS,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
the goal is not only to
validate clairvoyance

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
but also to understand
just how it works.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So this brings us to this
interesting paradigm shift that

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:10%
we're in right now.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're moving from a
materialistic paradigm that

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
holds that all that is
is the physical, what

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
we can touch that's around
us that we can perceive.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving into a
post-materialistic paradigm

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.875 align:middle line:84%
that believes that we are
more than just the physical.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
can perceive things

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that are beyond our
physical brain and body

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and can perceive things
beyond space and time.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:10%
Then this idea of being
able to see things

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:10%
that our eyes can't see or
that are in a different room

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:10%
or that are inside someone's
body become more plausible.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Should this study meet
its goal of validating

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, what could
the implications be?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> How exciting if from
this study people go, wow,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:90%
clairvoyance is real.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
It perceives reality at
this very vital level.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And I too can enhance my
own clairvoyant abilities

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and work those to help me
in my own everyday life,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to help me with self-healing,
to help me with friends,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.750 align:middle line:84%
to help me make decisions,
to help me make this world

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
a better place.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:10%
