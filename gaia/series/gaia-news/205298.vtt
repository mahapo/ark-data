00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Sergeant Clifford Stone, a
military insider who claimed

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.189 align:middle line:10%
to have been part of an elite
government unit tasked with

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:10%
investigating and retrieving
fallen UFOs, has died.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Remembering Clifford Stone.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.285 align:middle line:84%
This is Gaia News,
special edition.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
While there are countless
reports of UFO sightings and ET

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:84%
contacts, it's the accounts
of the military insiders that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:90%
have been the most compelling.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Clifford
Stone was one of

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
the first military
whistleblowers

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to come forward 20 years ago.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
According to Stone, his
story began in childhood

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
when the military found
out about his ET contact

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
experiences and recruited him
into the army at the age of 16.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There, while he officially
worked as a clerk,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
he claimed to have actually been
part of a secret government UFO

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:90%
crash retrieval team.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Clifford has provided thousands
of top secret documents

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:10%
to researchers in
the space for years.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:10%
They have left an
impact on many people

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:10%
about the nature of alien
life visiting this planet.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:10%
Steven Greer, the founder
of The Disclosure Project,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:10%
has known Clifford
since the late 1990s

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:10%
when he began to come
forward with his experiences.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Sergeant Stone was on
what they called NBC team.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:10%
It was Nuclear
Biological Chemical team.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:90%
That was their cover.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And those teams
had a compartment

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that dealt with retrieving
extraterrestrial vehicles

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
life forms that

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
had been recovered
from the result of our

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
targeting those craft
and shooting them down.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So he was a frontline responder
in a classified project

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:90%
back in the 1960s.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So this goes back, you know,
more than 50 years, obviously.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And learned a great deal from
his firsthand encounters,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and then subsequently
began researching it even

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
after his retirement
from the military.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Investigative journalist
Paola Harris has also known

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:10%
Clifford for many years and
helped him publish his last

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:10%
book, "Eyes Only."

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:10%
>> He said he did
12 crash retrievals,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:10%
three of them in Vietnam.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:10%
The first one was in Indiantown
Gap, Indiana in 1969.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So of course I'm shocked,
because 1969, I mean,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
everybody just
thinks of Roswell.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But since then, there
have been crash retrievals

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
right in the United States.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the last 20 years,
Sergeant Stone has described

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
many of his secret
missions in great detail.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:10%
He did so a few years ago on
Gaia's "Cosmic Disclosure."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Right around midnight,
maybe a little after,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
my unit commander came
up to me and says,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
we have an aircraft we believe
to be a Soviet aircraft that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
crashed not too far from here,
and we're recovering that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:90%
craft.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Then we started
seeing these lights

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:90%
in the area where we're going.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
We got closer.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
We saw the people moving around.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Then we saw the craft.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The craft was like
the heel of your shoe.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The side that was
closest to me, which

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
would be on the left
side of the craft,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
there was this
typical gray creature

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:90%
that was half in, half out.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And I, you know, could
identify on a very human level

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:90%
the loss they felt.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Sergeant Stone has also
talked about missions where he

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:84%
encountered living ETs, and
was often very emotional in his

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
testimony about his feelings
towards them and about

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:90%
their agenda on Earth.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, his consistent
testimony was that they were

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
very, very enlightened,
very high consciousness,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:90%
very highly intelligent.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Were really preoccupied with
our tendency to create war,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
and doing so after we had
discovered nuclear power

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:90%
and weapons.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But also, what we were
doing to the biosphere.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They were very, very
concerned and are

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
concerned with the damage
we're doing to the biosphere

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and to the Earth.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Sergeant Stone first came
forward with his experiences

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:10%
publicly at The Disclosure
Project's Press Club Conference

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:10%
in 2001.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I know we're not
alone in the universe.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
absence of evidence

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:90%
is not evidence of absence.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
It's evidence that has been
denied to the American people.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.629 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:10%
I stand before you today
and my almighty God

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:10%
and I tell you this.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
If Congress calls
me in and says,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
will you testify in
detail what you know,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I stand here today prepared
and ready to do just that.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Governments must never
lie to the people.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Steven Greer, who
organized the event,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:10%
on why Stone came forward.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The world needed
to know this,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and they needed to know it
in the correct perspective.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Not some disinformation
spin that there's

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
a threat to the
national security.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.550 align:middle line:84%
He understood that we needed
to get ahead of that curve

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that they were always going
to hoax an alien threat,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
because that would enable
them to not only unite

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
the world in war, but a war
against other civilizations,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
because it would
be very lucrative

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
to the military contractors,
et cetera, and so on.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
But it would also
control the populace

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
through fear, which is
always how demagogues

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:90%
control the populace.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, Clifford knew
this, and he knew

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that that was why it
was being kept secret

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and how they were going to
eventually bring this out.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond his role as a
pioneering whistleblower,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Sergeant Stone was known as a
deeply spiritual and moral man.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Clifford Stone was
for me love personified.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:90%
He walked his talk.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
He did everything that
he wanted humanity to be.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that he wanted
to tell the world, look,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
we are not alone, and we're
getting out of control

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:90%
with our technology.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We are being watched.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
If we don't grow in
our spirituality,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
we probably can't join with any
other of the cosmic cultures,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
because in order to
do that, you have

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.557 align:middle line:90%
to be a balanced human being.

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think Clifford
would want to be remembered

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:84%
as someone who spoke
the truth, with courage.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And he's someone
who actually walked

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
the talk, whereas as many
people talk, but they don't act.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.500 align:middle line:84%
He actually had the
courage of his convictions,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:84%
came forward with the
truth, and spoke the truth

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:90%
to the end of his life.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
how he would want

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
to be remembered, as a truth
teller and someone who,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:84%
with a pure heart, had a
genuine connection to the ETs

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:90%
and to the future of humanity.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> To many in the
field of ufology,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
the road to disclosure would
have looked very different

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
without the pioneering steps
of Sergeant Clifford Stone.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your
service, Sergeant Stone.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.256 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:33.056 align:middle line:90%
