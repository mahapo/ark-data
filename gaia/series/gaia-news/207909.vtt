00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.500 align:middle line:10%
The search for UFOs
usually has us looking out

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.660 align:middle line:10%
into the depths of space.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But what if we flipped it around
and looked towards the Earth

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.220 align:middle line:90%
from space?

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:90%
Can we find UFOs from above?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.270 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Searching for UFOs by pointing
satellites at the Earth--

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that's the idea in Harvard
professor Avi Loeb's latest

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.565 align:middle line:90%
article for "The Hill."

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Professor Loeb, also the author
of "Extraterrestrial: The First

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
Sign of Intelligent
Life Beyond Earth"

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:10%
and founder of the
Galileo Project, explains.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:10%
AVI LOEB: We are planning
to use satellite data

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and potentially look at
the unidentified objects

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:10%
from above.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:10%
And of course the
advantage of that,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:10%
we can cover the entire
Earth, whereas if we

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:10%
put the telescopes
on the ground,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:10%
we need to put a lot of
them to cover the same area.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:10%
And the goal is to establish
the reality of objects, first

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:10%
of all, from both directions--
from above using satellite

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:10%
data, and from below
using telescope systems.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
And one would guide the other.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we see
regions of activity,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
we can put our
telescope systems there.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And if our telescope system
sees something of interest,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
we can monitor what that thing
does from satellite data.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's an extremely
powerful method of verifying

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and guiding the
inquiry into the nature

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: Founded in
the summer of 2021,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
the goal of the
Galileo Project is

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
to bring the search for
extraterrestrial technology

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:90%
signatures into the mainstream.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:84%
What is the next step
when we find something?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
LOEB: The Galileo
Project has two branches.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
One is to figure out the nature
of any object near Earth.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
And we plan to
pursue that by using

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
ground-based telescopes
that we build,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
but also satellite data from
Planet Labs, for example.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And the second branch
of the Galileo Project

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
is to search for objects that
appear weird, like 'Oumuamua,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that do not look like a comet
or an asteroid that entered

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:90%
the solar system from outside.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the Vera
Rubin Observatory

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
will search for such
objects within a year.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And we plan to design
a space mission

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to bring a camera close to
an object like 'Oumuamua

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and take a high
resolution image of it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:10%
Because they say a picture
is worth a thousand words

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: Professor
Loeb pointed out

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:10%
in his book,
"Extraterrestrial," that if we

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:10%
had a system in place
when 'Oumuamua soared

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:10%
through our solar
system in 2017,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:10%
we would have photos
of the object.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Now with this plan, we'll be
ready for the next 'Oumuamua.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:90%
But how will humanity react?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
LOEB: We have no
protocol as to how

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to respond to an object
that is so close to us.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
All the past protocols
were designed

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
for a signal that comes from
a distant star very far away

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and we would have plenty
of time to think how

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
to respond to such a signal.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But if there is an
object next door,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the question is,
what is its intent?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
What kind of information
is it gathering?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Who would represent humanity?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:90%
And what should we do about it?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And these are questions to
which we don't have answers,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and they will have major
societal implications.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So as part of the
Galileo Project,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
we are pondering
on these questions.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't have answers as of yet.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:10%
NARRATOR: The Galileo Project is
building their first telescope

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:10%
system on the roof of the
Harvard College Observatory.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
It will take some time
and lots of funding

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to realize their
vision of hundreds

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:90%
of telescopes around the world.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But they hope to
find some data soon.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:10%

this is "Gaia News."
