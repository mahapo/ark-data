00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Is the universe an
interconnected neural network,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950 align:middle line:10%
a new way of thinking about
how different areas of physics

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.380 align:middle line:10%
and the universe
could be connected?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:10%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.660 align:middle line:84%
For years, physicists have
tried to unify classical physics

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and quantum physics.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:10%
Classical physics goes back to
the time of Sir Isaac Newton.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's based on mechanical,
physical equations

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that everything operates
like clockwork--

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:90%
predictable and knowable.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics looks at the
microscopic subatomic levels

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and how particles, waves,
and force fields interact.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But the more fundamental laws
of physics at this quantum level

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
are the antithesis of how they
behave at a classical level.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Instead of certainty,
you have uncertainty.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
So how do we connect
these different views

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and the so-called
theory of everything?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:10%
In a recent paper by University
of Minnesota-Duluth physics

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:10%
professor Vitaly
Vanchurin, he argues

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:10%
this can exist if
the universe is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:10%
connected in a neural network.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Theresa Bullard, physicist
and host of Gaia's "Mystery

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Teachings," explains.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:10%
>> This paper about the universe
could be a neural network is,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
I would say, a model at the
moment of trying to figure out

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:10%
how can we merge
classical physics,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:10%
like general relativity,
with quantum physics.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that
he's coming up with

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
is to use a similar
method that scientists

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
are using to model how
the human brain works.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And they use this
process that they

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
call neural networks
to create, for example,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.690 align:middle line:84%
the programming language
for artificial intelligence.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So he's using the same
model, the same idea,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, can we model the
universe, the entire universe,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
and how it operates off of
the same concept or the same--

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
it's a mental
framework, basically.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This paper can't yet prove
that the universe is a neural

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:90%
But what did we learn?

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.295 align:middle line:84%
>> It does bring up
some interesting ideas.

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
The idea, for example,
a neural network.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
If we think about
the human brain,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.297 align:middle line:84%
the neural networks
are very connected.

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always this
information that's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
being exchanged from
one neuron to another

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.445 align:middle line:90%
across those synaptic gaps.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and the whole of the human
brain is very interconnected.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So if we're applying that
model to the universe,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like saying,
well, could the whole universe

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
be very interconnected, not
just physically but also

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
in how the laws
of physics operate

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
from the macro scale
to the micro scale

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:90%
and even to the subatomic scale?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind
of interconnection?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind
of structure or order

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to how those laws
of physics work

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and how they take
energy and information

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and what they do with it?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this way of thinking
affect our way of looking

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
at the universe and the
theory of everything?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> From the people
who are proposing it,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I think that they like the
idea of the interconnectedness.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think that they're
coming from a purely

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:84%
physical and mathematical
and computational approach.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel that until scientists
also start looking at, well,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
what about consciousness, not
from a epiphenomenon of neurons

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
in the brain but consciousness
as a fundamental essence

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
within the universe,
consciousness as primary

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and also non-physical
things such as spirit.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:10%
It's like we need to
bring that non-physical,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness, that spirit
into the equations somehow

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:10%
or at least into an
understanding of how,

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:10%
when they find their
physical model--

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:10%
their theory of everything
at a physical level--

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:10%
how does that interact
with consciousness.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What does this neural
network theory show,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.603 align:middle line:90%
and what is it missing?

00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> The verdict is still out.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's still too early in the game
to know whether this is going

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:90%
to gain any traction or not.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And either way, it's
still just a mental model.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's still a model of how we
just take information, put it

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of
simulation, and then get

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
information out that gives
us the equations that we know

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:90%
of that govern our universe.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It's still not showing us
the fundamental essence

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of why is it that way, what
governs that structure.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And that fundamental
essence, that's

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
what's beyond that
neural network.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
What's behind that
structure, that's

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
what we really need to be asking
the bigger questions about.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What is behind
that structure?

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's intelligence
behind that structure.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's the mind of
the spirit, the oneness of all.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The purpose defines
the structure.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:90%
It gives it its definition.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a reason for it.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a random thing.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose
fundamentally relates to us.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Who are we as spirit
beings, as eternal beings,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
as consciousness here having
a physical experience?

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.885 align:middle line:84%
But this physical
experience is an experience.

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily who we are.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So somehow I believe that
we are at the core of why

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
this universe works
the way it does.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now this neural network
idea is an interesting theory--

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
a thought exercise of how
the universe is connected

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and a possible way to reconcile
quantum and classical physics.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
spiritual element?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
At its most
fundamental definition,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
physics deals with matter,
energy, motion, and force,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and communicates with
the language of math.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But are modern
physicists missing

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
conscious connection

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in the universe and beyond?

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the key to the
mysteries of the universe?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:10%
For new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
