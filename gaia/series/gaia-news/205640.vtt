>> Vikings dominated the North
Atlantic seas for at least 300

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870 align:middle line:10%
years, but how did they sail
across great distances with

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:10%
incredible accuracy
without a magnetic compass?

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%
A long-held theory about Vikings
using crystals for navigation

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:84%
may have been proven
true with modern science.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The Vikings, the
Great North Sea Men,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
sailed from Norway to Greenland
and many parts in between.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
They were known to have
amazing Maritime navigation

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
skills by using the sun to plot
their position on the globe.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But scientists have
wondered for years, how

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
could they navigate when
they could not see the sun?

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Enter the sun stone, or
solar sign, a crystal

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
that, when held up
to a cloudy sky,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:90%
can help to locate the sun.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
For years, the use
of sun stones have

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
been nothing but a
theory based on a legend,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
such as this mention in
the tale, "Raudulfs Fattr."

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> "The King made
people look out,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and they could nowhere
see a clear sky.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
Then he asked Sigurdur to tell
where the sun was at that time.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%
He gave a clear assertion.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Then, the king made them fetch
the solar stone and held it up

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and saw where the light
radiated from the stone

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and, thus, directly verified
Sigurdur's prediction."

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, two Hungarian scientists
have used computer modeling

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to determine that by using a
sun stone every three hours,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
a medieval Viking could reach
Greenland with 92% to 100%

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:90%
accuracy.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.615 align:middle line:10%
Kaedrich Olsen, author of "Runes
for Transformation," on how sun

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:10%
stones work.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>> The way we think that these
work is since the sun stone

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:10%
doubles the imagery within
it, and it's only with certain

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:10%
polarized light, and
you look through it,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.470 align:middle line:10%
and as you scan the horizon,
you'll be able to pick up where

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.353 align:middle line:10%
the sun is.

00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way you would navigate
off of that is, of course,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.363 align:middle line:84%
you have to be aware of how
many hours the sun has been up.

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So as you're
scanning the horizon,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.738 align:middle line:84%
you're able to get an
idea of where the sun is,

00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
so you get an angle of
where the sun is in the sky.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
You know how many hours
it is, and based on that,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you can sort of do a
bit of a calculation

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
so that you can reorient
the navigation of your ship

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
so that you can stay on
course where you're going.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Viking sailing routes are
notorious for bad weather,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:90%
storms, and cloudy days.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:10%
The sun stone,
researchers have proven,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:10%
was a vital tool for navigation.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And the reason why you'd
want to use a sun stone is, say,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:84%
we're in the North
Sea or, really,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
in the northern hemisphere
trying to navigate around,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
it's really difficult
in that area,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.042 align:middle line:84%
because it's cloudy
most of the time,

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
so you don't know
where the sun is.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
where the sun is,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:90%
you don't know where you are.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the neat property
of the sun stone

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is it can help you detect where
the sun is behind the clouds.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very useful
thing to know when navigating.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Viking tales passed down
through time have mentioned sun

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:90%
stones.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.597 align:middle line:84%
Why have we just recently looked
into the validity of their use?

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of those kind of fun
things in Norse lore where we

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
get a little fragment
of a hint of something,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and unless there's
archaeological evidence

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:84%
to prove it or some sort of
correlating literature from

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
another culture, we just kind
of shrug it off saying we

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:90%
don't know.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
But since we've actually
found chunks of calcite

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
on, basically, Viking ships and
on other contemporary ships,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
we know that they were
there-- used for that.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Viking culture has had a bad
reputation throughout history

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
as bloodthirsty,
violent raiders,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
but is that an
accurate portrayal?

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Since we're talking
around the 900s to 1200s,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
commonly thought of
as the Viking era,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
the reason why the Norse
people, with their Viking boats,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:84%
got such a horrid reputation is
their boats were able to only

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
sink just a few
inches into the water.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
They gave them the
ability that they

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
could navigate across
great seas, where

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
they can effortlessly go up
estuaries and rivers almost

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:90%
silently.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.963 align:middle line:84%
Think of the Viking boat as
the stealth bomber of its day.

00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:90%
People didn't see it coming.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.090 align:middle line:84%
They didn't hear it coming,
and more often than not,

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
really, the Vikings were
trading, mostly peaceful,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
but those times
where they did do

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the raiding and the
conquering, the history

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
was mostly written by the sore
losers rather than the winners.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we get
this inflated reputation

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Vikings being
these really awful,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
brutal, vicious warriors,
when, in truth, the archaeology

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.215 align:middle line:84%
and the history shows us
that they were violent,

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but they were no more
violent than just about

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
every other culture was at
the planet at the same time.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Although they have
had a bad reputation,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Vikings were not just vicious
marauders killing everyone

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:90%
in sight.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Violent?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but no more than any other
civilization of their time.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:10%
They also had complex society,
religion, legal system, and now

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:10%
researchers have proven
their use of technology.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
This is another
example that shows

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
real history is different from
what we have learned in school,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.020 align:middle line:84%
seen in the movies,
and even read in books,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and the history we think we
may not be the full story.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
