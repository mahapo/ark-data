>> Given that heart disease
is the leading cause of death

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.810 align:middle line:10%
in the world, prevention and
treatment has never been more

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.630 align:middle line:10%
important.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.270 align:middle line:84%
While conventional
cardiology relies heavily

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:84%
on pharmaceuticals
and the management

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of cardiac conditions,
music has been

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
shown to have remarkable
benefits without any side

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.020 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Music as medicine.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures understood
the healing benefits of music,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and integrated it into their
promotion of health and healing

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:90%
of disease.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:84%
This practice was mostly lost
in the rise of Western medicine.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Today, that connection
is gradually

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
being restored as a
new wave of research

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
is being done on the healing
benefits of music on the heart.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
One such recent study found
that listening to music

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
is linked to a significant
reduction in anxiety and pain

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:90%
after major heart surgery.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:10%
The researchers concluded that
clinicians should consider

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:10%
music for patients
scheduled for surgery, as it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:10%
has none of the
risks or side effects

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:10%
and many of the
benefits of the drugs

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:10%
most commonly used to aid
in post-surgery recovery.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Other studies have
shown that music

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
modulates blood pressure,
heart rate, and respiration,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and can even lower
the rate of death

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
after a heart attack or stroke.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Stephen Sinatra is a
cardiologist and author

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.996 align:middle line:10%
who has been incorporating music
in his practice for decades.

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:10%
>> What the music does, it tones
down the overactive sympathetic

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:10%
nervous system, and it balances
the sympathetic nervous system

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:10%
with the parasympathetic.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And that in itself is a great
reliever of panic and anxiety.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
When you have the biochemical
alterations going down,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the body responds in a
more appropriate manner.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It has what we call a
positive impact on heart rate

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%
variability.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
It can actually decrease
a person's blood pressure.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that over
and over again.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I have even seen music have an
impact on cardiac arrhythmia.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I've used it over
and over again in my practice

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.025 align:middle line:10%
over the years.

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Joanne Loewy, the
director of the Louis Armstrong

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:10%
Center for Music and
Medicine at Mount Sinai,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:10%
Beth Israel Hospital, had this
take on the effects of music

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.796 align:middle line:10%
on the heart.

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:10%
>> We know, for instance,
in the life cycle,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:10%
the first sound a
premature infant hears,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:10%
a neonate in the
womb, is cardiac.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Its rhythm.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The music brain
formulates neural pathways

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
which have been shown to be
able to have music predominance.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
This means that we can
implement music that's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
indicated in things like
building resilience,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and cardiac strength
and resilience.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Another of music benefits is
creating heart-brain coherence.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:10%
Barry Goldstein is a
composer and author

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:10%
whose music has been used in a
number of therapeutic settings.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.826 align:middle line:10%
He had this to say about
this important phenomenon.

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:10%
>> So music can be used very
effectively in creating heart

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:10%
coherence and also
with brain coherence.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:10%
And coherence, when we're
talking about heart coherence,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:10%
is when our heart
has the ability

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:10%
to move to a smooth
orderly heart rhythms.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The heart has the ability to
dictate that tempo that goes

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
out to the rest of our systems.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Music can engage
the heart to moving

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
into those smooth
orderly rhythms

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:90%
by targeting specific tempos.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we utilize
heart entrainment, which

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
is the heart synchronizing
to the external tempo

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
of the music, we can move
to smoother and more orderly

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
heart rhythms that then set the
tempo for the rest of our body

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
to move into more
coherence as well.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When used therapeutically,
what kind of music is most

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.136 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to the heart?

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Therapeutic music played
in time with the live rhythms.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
This is showing an even deeper
and more profound effect.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
This harbors safety
and harbors security,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and decreases the
stress response,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
which affects the body and
the body's disease process.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Music therapists, such as
those at the Louis Armstrong

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Center for Music and Medicine,
approach the utilization

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of music and an intimate
personalized way.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In general, the rule is to
meet patients in their favorite

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.170 align:middle line:84%
kind of music, and then
to design and prescribe

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
what's going to serve them best
if they're completely stressed

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and their heart rate is
super high and scattered,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to immediately
implode something relaxing.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the promising
findings of recent studies,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
there is much excitement
about future research

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.341 align:middle line:84%
into the healing benefits
of music on the heart.

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of studies are
really talking about music

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:10%
in a general way, that
music helped in this way,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:10%
or music therapy
helped in this way.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But what if we actually
design that studies much more

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:84%
specifically utilizing specific
frequencies in the music that

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
could show benefit, or utilizing
specific tempos within music

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that can be of benefit,
or even new genres

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at
that are specifically

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.156 align:middle line:84%
towards music that
can be researched.

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
>> While more research
is forthcoming,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
it's already clear that
music truly is medicine.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:10%
