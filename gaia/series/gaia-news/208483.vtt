On the Indonesian
island of Flores,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:84%
some locals tell tales of an
animal that is like a human,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:90%
but is not human.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:10%
Some say they are extinct.

Anthropologist
Gregory Forth, who

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:84%
lived with and
studied the people

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of the island for decades,
calls this creature the Apeman.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
For years, it was an
interesting story.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But, as many anthropologists
will tell you,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
stories like this are
often allegory or a way

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:90%
to explain the natural world.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:10%
But, in 2004, the
anthropological world

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:10%
was shaken when the
Hobbit skeleton was found.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
This was a tiny
species of hominin.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:10%
A rebuilt skeleton
stands at just 3 feet

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:10%
7 inches but apparently
lived at the same time

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:10%
as early modern humans.

The tale of how the oral
histories and the fossils,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:10%
dubbed Homofloresiensis,
could possibly be related

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:10%
is the subject of Professor
Forth's new book "Between Ape

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:10%
and Human."

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:10%
Professor Forth, now retired,
was a Professor of Anthropology

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Alberta
for more than three decades.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:10%
He first heard of the Apeman
from the Lio people of Flores

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:10%
in the 1980s.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.086 align:middle line:10%
But what about this story
sounded like it might be true?

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the way that people
were describing them,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:10%
and as animals, as
a kind of animal.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.910 align:middle line:10%
Not human beings, by the way.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The distinction is very
important for them,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:90%
as it is for most people.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But, at the same time, they're
beings that walked erect,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
unlike any other animal and
otherwise looked human-like,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:90%
although they were very small--

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:90%
or they are very small--

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and somewhat hairier
than themselves.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The locals believe these
so-called Apemen are animals.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
What else did they say
about these creatures?

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The Apemen are credited by
some people with supernatural

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
powers, but then so are a bunch
of other animals on the island,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
including very rare
turtles and crabs.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So, too, are monkeys,
local monkeys.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I could go
on and extend the list.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So just to say that some
species have supernatural powers

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
it doesn't exist

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:90%
as a physical natural being.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:90%

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The best explanation,
in terms of the evidence

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:84%
I have and in terms of
reason and logic and so on

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is that they are descendants
of other non-sapiens hominin.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Whether anybody wants
believe that or not,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:90%
of course, is up to them.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the Sherlock
Holmes method.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
You go through all the
possible explanations

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and you exclude them one by one
in relation to the evidence,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and the one that remains
has got to be correct,

no matter how incredible
or improbable it may seem.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can criticize that
methodology a little bit,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
but it is actually the way a lot
of science works as well, too.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:10%

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%

could be other creatures.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence for hominins,
not sapiens obviously,

but hominins on Flores

Now, that would give
whatever was there,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
however it got there, that
would give it a lot of time
