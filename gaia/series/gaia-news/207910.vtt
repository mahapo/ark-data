The oldest known Homo
sapiens in Africa

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.380 align:middle line:10%
pushed back thousands of years,
and an amateur archeologist

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:10%
finds an ancient

Southwestern Ethiopia.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:10%
A mystery nearly a quarter of
a million years in the making

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
has been solved.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Homo sapien remains found near
the Omo river, dubbed Omo 1,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:10%
were originally
found in the 1960s.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:10%
Scientists struggled
for years to establish

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:10%
a date for these remains,
but in 2005, they

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:10%
determined Omo was
approximately 195,000 years old.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, a new study by
volcanologist, Dr.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:10%
CÃ©line Vidal of
Cambridge University,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:10%
pushes that date much farther
back by more than 30,000 years,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:10%
which places modern humans
in Eastern Africa more than

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:10%
230,000 years ago.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Vidal was able
to determine this

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:10%
by comparing the
thick layers of ash

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:10%
left by an ancient volcano from
the top of the remains of Omo 1

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:10%
with ash known to be from
a volcano that erupted

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
about 230,000 years ago.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now that the minimum date for
Homo sapiens in Eastern Africa

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
has been established,
researchers

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
are searching for the maximum.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:10%
As Christine Lane, a co-author
of the study, stated,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:10%
"It's possible that new
finds and new studies

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:10%
may extend the
age of our species

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:10%
even further back in time."

A Polish diplomat has reportedly
found a long-lost ancient city

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:10%
that professional
archeologists and historians

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:10%
have been searching
for for two centuries.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:10%
Robert Rokicki, a Polish
diplomat and history enthusiast

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:10%
stationed in Turkey,
told the Anadolu Agency

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.030 align:middle line:10%
he found the ancient
city of Thebasa

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:10%
by doing what he calls
histracking or off-road hiking

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:10%
in historical places.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Rokicki believes
the ancient city

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is in the Pinarkaya village
of southern Karaman province.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:10%
Thebasa played a role in the
five-centuries long conflict

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:10%
between the Byzantine Empire
and the Muslim caliphates

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:10%
but was destroyed and apparently
abandoned in the year 806 AD.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:10%
The Roman geographer, Pliny,
had written of Thebasa,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:10%
saying it lay in
the Taurus mountains

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:10%
but until now had
never been found.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the best part
is Rokicki found the city

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.960 align:middle line:90%
by accident.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
He says he was looking
for another place

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
altogether when he
stumbled onto Thebasa.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, Professor Stephen
Mitchell, British Academy

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:10%
fellow, said of the amateur
Rokicki's discovery,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.420 align:middle line:10%
he, quote, "Adds a
whole new chapter

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:10%
to the story of the conflict
between the Byzantines

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:10%
and the Arabs in the
10th and 11th centuries."

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now that the site
has been located,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
expect to see many
more discoveries

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
as the professional
archeologists will surely

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:90%
be there soon.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:10%
