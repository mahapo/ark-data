00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.250 align:middle line:10%
>> NASA has committed to putting
humans on the moon by 2024

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.550 align:middle line:10%
and human settlements by 2030.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But what will it take to
achieve this lofty goal?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.680 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Under NASA's Artemis
Program, the Space Agency

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
announced priority of
going back to the moon

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:84%
by 2024, with settlements on
the lunar surface by 2030.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:90%
The program has many goals.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Chief among them,
to learn how to live

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
another planet.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But the moon's surface is a
harsh and hostile environment.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Micrometeorites
pelting the surface

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
like missiles, 400
degree temperature

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
swings, and the constant
risk of radiation exposure

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
from the sun.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
With so many obstacles,
how can humans

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
put long-term settlements
on the lunar surface?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, we
will have to supply

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the same foundations of human
survival as we do on Earth--

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
water, shelter, food, and
on the moon, of course,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
we'll have to
supply oxygen. NASA

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
is partnering with public
and private partners

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:90%
to solve these problems.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.945 align:middle line:90%
So what have we learned?

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:10%
Marc Dantonio, astronomer and
chief photo and video analyst

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:10%
for the Mutual UFO Network
on the challenges ahead.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
First things first, how will
astronaut's access oxygen?

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.848 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, if we go to the
moon we have to make oxygen.

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to be able
to bring oxygen for a colony

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:10%
that's going to last 25 years.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:10%
So we have to make it.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.407 align:middle line:90%
How would you make it?

00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:46.198 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're not going
to take in something

00:01:46.198 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:84%
from the atmosphere
and convert it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
to oxygen. What we have to
do is something different.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
We have to get into
the soil on the moon.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at its
chemical compounds.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have to break
those chemical compounds

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
either in a furnace or
through some chemical process.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And out of that, have as a
waste product that we need

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:90%
the air that we would breathe.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we get water?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
We can bring it
with us or make it.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The latest mission data shows
us that the moon's surface has

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:10%
this dust and soil.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:90%
We call it regolith.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry, it's a word.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The soil on the moon has
actually got water within it.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Not drops of water,
but water compounds

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that are baked into the rocks
that we can get back out.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So we would have to go through
a chemical, and probably

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
heating process, to extract
water from the lunar soil.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> What about sun flares?

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
affect us on Earth,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:84%
but an X flare from
the sun could knock out

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
any habitat on the lunar
surface and shoot right

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:90%
through an astronaut's body.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Knowing this, where could
we live on the moon?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't build a dome or
what I call "inflatatat,"

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
an inflatable habitat
on the moon's surface.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
We build a structure
under the moon's surface

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
where they'll be more
protected underground.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:84%
If we can do that, maybe the X
class flares will not be as big

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.720 align:middle line:84%
a problem, because the deeper
we go on the lunar surface,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
the more we'll be protected
from this radiation.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And that presents
another problem.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Moondust or regolith has
been described as fine

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.763 align:middle line:84%
as talcum powder, but
it can cut like glass.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the astronauts
walking in the moon,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't go on their
last moonwalk because around

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
the ankles the insulation
was cut right through,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the suit was cut right through
actually to the insulation

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:90%
inside the suit.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's from shuffling
your feet in the moondust

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of hours.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So everything in other
words, has to be redesigned.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Our industry here on
Earth works great.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Rocks are soft compared to
what moondust can do to you.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> How will we guarantee the
safety of the astronauts?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:10%
>> We're not going to go to the
moon as humans until a bunch

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:10%
of robots go first and test the
environment to make sure that

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:10%
we can, one, make water.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:10%
Two, make oxygen, Three,
have a sensible habitat

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:10%
on the moon that's safe.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> With space exploration,
every time we solve one problem,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:90%
another problem seems to arise.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Why go there?

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.158 align:middle line:90%
Why go through all of this?

00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's probably the most
important thing for us to do,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
This leads the way to doing
other things, such as resource

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.980 align:middle line:90%
gathering from the moon.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:10%
The moon is full of titanium and
other precious metals as well.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:10%
So what better way
than to establish a way

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:10%
to get to the nearest
neighbor we have

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:10%
that's a beautiful treasure
trove of minerals just waiting

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:10%
for us to go pick them up
then to actually develop

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:10%
the technology to
go there and do it.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Meantime, for some people,
bases on the moon have existed

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.620 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.860 align:middle line:10%
NASA whistleblower Ken
Johnston made this claim

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia's Beyond Belief.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.823 align:middle line:10%
>> By shifting the light with
the modern technology we have,

00:05:13.823 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:10%
you can actually see there are
five little points of light

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:10%
in this one big glow
in the dark center.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So we now have some
proof that what I

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.704 align:middle line:90%
had shown to them back in 19--

00:05:22.704 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:84%
mercy-- 1970-1971, that there
was a base there on the moon.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever the race
to the moon is about,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
NASA plans to have a
presence on the moon on 2024,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
with permanent
settlements by 2030.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But the moon is not
the ultimate goal.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
The next step,
NASA says, is Mars.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So whether NASA's
goal is to get to Mars

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or to catch the public up
on a space program that's

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
been hidden for years,
one thing is for certain,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the space race has
increased more than ever.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
