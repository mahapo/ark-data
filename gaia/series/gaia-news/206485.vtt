00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.380 align:middle line:10%
>> New research into channeling
is getting closer to validating

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.700 align:middle line:10%
and explaining the ancient
practice and is showing that

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.460 align:middle line:10%
everyone has the innate
ability to channel.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> While the practice of
channeling has existed

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of history,
it has always been shrouded

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:90%
in mystery and misunderstanding.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:10%
Dr. HelanÃ© Wahbeh is
the director of research

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:10%
for the Institute of
Noetic Sciences, or IONS,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:10%
whose mission is to reveal
the interconnected nature

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:10%
of reality through
scientific exploration.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Wahbeh has been
practicing and researching

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:10%
channeling for decades.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:84%
She is the author of
the newly released book,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
"The Science of Channeling".

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:10%
>> The way I define channeling
is the process of accessing

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:10%
information and energy beyond
our conventional notions

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:10%
of time and space that can
appear receptive or expressive.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:10%
We propose that
anybody can channel,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:10%
that it's actually this
innate human capacity

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.655 align:middle line:10%
that everybody has.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:10%
The channeling phenomenon
exists on a spectrum,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:10%
from perhaps
intuition and hunches

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:10%
that everyone could
probably say that they've

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:10%
had at one time or another,
to more rare experiences,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:10%
like trance channeling, or
mediumship, or mind over

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:10%
matter psychokinesis.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
everything in between,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
like being able to
sense the future

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:90%
or mind-to-mind communication.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Wahbeh and the team
at IONS have just completed

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:10%
a study in which they analyzed
the characteristics of 500

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:10%
channelers to
answer the question,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:10%
what makes a channeler?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They call the
unique way in which

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a channeler receives
and uses information

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
their noetic signature.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:10%
>> So we coined this term,
the noetic signature,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:10%
that refers to this unique
and diverse fingerprint,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:10%
if you will, of people's
channeling abilities.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And we created a measure
to be able to see

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:90%
what that looks like.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
Noetic Myers-Briggs,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
which is a personality test,
to be able to understand

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:90%
people's channeling expression.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.760 align:middle line:10%
We have 12 different categories
of channeling or noetic

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:10%
experiences that make up
this noetic signature.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Now that the
inventory is complete,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:10%
IONS will soon be making it
available to the public so that

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:10%
everyone can assess their
own unique noetic signature.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:84%
IONS has also been doing
some fascinating research

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.770 align:middle line:84%
on the genetic basis of
channeling abilities.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They recently completed
a study in which

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
they analyzed the DNA of
a group of channelers.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many, many
anecdotes where people share

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:10%
that their experiences of
channeling run in family,

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:10%
so we did a case control study.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We found 13 high
functioning psychics

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.470 align:middle line:84%
who had various
channeling abilities.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We had them give
a saliva sample,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and we looked at their DNA.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So this TNRC18 gene was
statistically significantly

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
different in the channelers
versus the controls.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The controls, the
people who said

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
they didn't have
channeling abilities,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
had the mutation whereas
all of the channelers

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
had the original
version of that gene.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
The notion of this
supports this concept

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that we actually all
have an innate capacity

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:90%
to channel on some level.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Another area of recent
research is around where

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
channeled information
comes from.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people believe that
it is part of themselves,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
the higher self,
collective consciousness.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
highest scored results

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%
for what the sources are.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
We have other people, like
mediums or trance channelers,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
who say it's actually
deceased humans

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and multidimensional beings.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We're working on various
visualization tools

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see if we can
assess that in the future,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
but right now, we
can't definitively

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:90%
say what the source is.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
On some level, it
doesn't really matter

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
what the source is if the
information that you're

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
receiving is supporting
you in some way.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In another fascinating
study, researchers at IONS used

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
the tools of quantum physics
to measure energetic shifts

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
created by channeling.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:10%
Using a quantum noise
generator placed

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:10%
in the room where trance
channeling sessions were being

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:10%
held, they found a shift
away from randomness,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:10%
indicating that there is
an objective difference

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:10%
in the environment in which
channeling takes place.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:10%
More research is underway
to try to explain just

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:10%
how channeling works.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We are developing tools
to be able to sense, perhaps,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
discarnate beings or energy
that's moving during healing

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We're working on this as
part of a biofield sensor

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
using quantum number generators,
random number generators,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:90%
capacitance.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But what we're learning
about how it works

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:90%
is that it's not a force.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not a force,
because we experience receiving

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and expressing channeling
information that's not

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:90%
dependent on time and space.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:10%
So whatever mechanism is
at play with channeling

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:10%
is likely not
working through what

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:10%
we understand of our
materialistic paradigm that's

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:10%
dependent on forces.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.290 align:middle line:10%
>> In her new book, Dr. Wahbeh
outlines practices that anyone

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:10%
can do to develop their
innate channeling abilities,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:10%
which she feels
could be of great use

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:10%
in today's challenging times.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:10%
>> And so any tool that we
have that can support us to go

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:10%
inward and access this much
larger well of information,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:10%
could we perhaps find solutions
that we haven't been able

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:10%
to find thus far to support
humanity in these incredibly

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:10%
intense times?
