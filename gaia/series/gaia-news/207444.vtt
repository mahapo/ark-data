00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:10%
Recently, physicist Pascal
Koiran in Lyon, France

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
published a preprint study
detailing the potential

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:10%
that matter could enter the
event horizon of a black hole,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:10%
pass through a wormhole, and
exit out the other end intact.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:10%
Though still highly
theoretical, wormholes

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:10%
are believed to be
incredibly unstable,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
as they exist as a tunnel
between a black hole

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:10%
and a white hole in another
part of the universe.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But because nothing,
including light,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
can escape a black hole once it
has crossed its event horizon,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:84%
physicists have
believed that matter

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
would need to somehow enter the
wormhole outside of the event

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
horizon in order to
safely pass through.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:10%
Doctor Simeon Hein, director
of the Institute for Resonance,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
explains the
mind-bending physics

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.651 align:middle line:10%
of this theoretical phenomenon.

00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:10%
>> So the idea people were
beginning to think, well,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:10%
what happens to the matter
and energy that gets condensed

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:10%
and condensed and condensed
into a black hole?

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:10%
The idea was that it had to
be ejected somewhere else

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
beyond that point in space.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:10%
And that became the
idea of a wormhole

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
to another point in spacetime,
where all the matter and energy

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:10%
would be ejected
from the black hole.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
To conserve this
idea of symmetry,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
which is the foundation
of modern physics,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a basic
symmetry to the universe.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the other side of the
wormhole is a white hole.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.495 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:10%
>> If wormholes have been
conceptualized by theoretical

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.480 align:middle line:10%
physics for decades, what is
so novel about the mathematics

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:10%
proposed in this recent paper?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Physicist, I believe,
Pascal Koiran in France,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
he looked at another way
to measure what's going

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
on in the mathematics
of black holes.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And he used a different metric
than Einstein would have used,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:10%
and some other
physicists, because back

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:10%
in the 1950s, two different
physicists, David Finkelstein

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:10%
and Sir Arthur Eddington of
the Royal Society in the UK,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:10%
both proposed that
there was this point

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:10%
of no return in the
black hole, where

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:10%
once you got past
a certain point,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:10%
it was no longer symmetrical.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't leave anymore,
and the so-called Schwarzschild

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
radius.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.672 align:middle line:84%
And past this point,
you would just

00:03:03.672 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:90%
keep getting more compressed.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go
through the wormhole.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.832 align:middle line:10%
So using this so-called
Finkelstein-Eddington metric--

00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:10%
and a metric, by the way,
it's just kind of the idea,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:10%
like you're familiar
with a ruler, just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:10%
kind of a standard
unit of measurement,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:10%
kind of a standard unit of
anything, speed or direction

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:10%
or position.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Using this other so-called
Finkelstein-Eddington

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
measurement, Koiran was able
to show that it's actually

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
more stable than you think, that
there is some stability, even

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
at the highest level of
gravitational compression

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
in a black hole,
which would suggest

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
that moving through it, maybe
something really would survive.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> While these abstract ideas
are a fun thought experiment,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
what practical applications
could they have for us here

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're talking about
is creating other types

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
of gravitational fields, objects
that can create their own

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
inertial and gravitational
fields, anti-gravity.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
So could this be dangerous?

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It could result in exotic
propulsion systems.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this could already be
a classified topic within the US

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
military because we
know all the people that

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
have looked at these
gravitational effects,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it has been
funded by the US military,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
going all the way
back to the 1950s,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:90%
including the US Air Force.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
touching on here, I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:84%
mean, potentially a very
important topic for propulsion

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and transportation,
even the possibilities

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of weaponization,
which is something

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to think about.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about real physics

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
here and how matter behaves
when it's compressed

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to a high degree, when the
gravitational metrics change

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So what started out as
something really far away,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
the idea of black holes as
just a theoretical possibility,

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
has now become
something where it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
could be something
that we actually

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:90%
see right here on Earth.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:10%
