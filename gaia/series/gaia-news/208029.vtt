study shows that people with

clairvoyant abilities can see

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:10%
is world-shattering and would
completely revamp our health

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:10%
care system.

The Institute of Noetic
Sciences, or IONS,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:10%
has just released the results
of an important study which

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:10%
shows that energy healing works
and that clairvoyants can pick

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:10%
up information about
the healing by using

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:10%
their extended perception.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.870 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Helane Wahbeh is
the head of research

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:10%
at IONS and the study lead.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Clairvoyance essentially is
the experience of being able

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:10%
to see things around people,
see within their body,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:10%
around their body, and gain
information in a way that is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.850 align:middle line:10%
beyond our normal sight.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes this
shows up as colors.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people can see illness
in others' bodies, what might

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:90%
be called medical intuition.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can learn how to
be a clairvoyant seer.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are
people who teach

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
medical intuitive classes.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:10%
I've talked to many
teachers who say

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:10%
that as long as the person
believes that they can,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:10%
they can actually
learn how to do this.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that everyone's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
going to be excellent at it
but that the baseline level

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
skill is learnable by
anyone who is willing to try

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.662 align:middle line:90%
and believes that they can.

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers sought to
examine these abilities within

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
the context of a study of
Reiki, a popular Japanese energy

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
healing modality.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.610 align:middle line:84%
In the study, 40 participants
with varying health issues

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
were given half-hour
Reiki sessions

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
which were then shown to
improve their well-being.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
While the sessions
were taking place,

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
a group of six experienced
clairvoyant seers observed.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We wanted to answer a number
of research questions through

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:90%
this study.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The first one was, do
the different perceivers

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:90%
perceive in the same way?

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the corroboration
in what they

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:90%
received during the session?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:10%
We looked at four
different types of data

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:10%
for this question.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:10%
And what we found overall
was that the perceivers did

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:10%
corroborate the information
that they were receiving

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:10%
and that this was beyond what
we would expect by chance.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The second question was about
the degree of corroboration

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
with the different
people in the study.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:10%
For example, did the
Reiki master's answers

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:10%
match up with the perceivers?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Did it match up
with the participant

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:10%
on the various forms that
we had them fill out?

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:10%
And these were forms about the
participants' physical symptoms

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:10%
and also the way the energy
was moving in the space.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And we found that yes, they did.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Another really important
question the study sought

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to answer had to do with the
degree of accuracy with which

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:84%
the seers were able to pick
up on the participant's health

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:90%
state before the session.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:10%
>> For this one, the
participants checked what type

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:10%
of symptoms they were having,
and then the perceivers also

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:10%
filled out the same form, seeing
if they could see what was

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:10%
going on with the participant.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And this had a
high corroboration.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what are the
implications of these

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:90%
remarkable findings?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Extended perception is a
human capacity that we are just

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
barely scratching the surface
on in terms of its abilities

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
to support us in health
and other many practical

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:90%
applications.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The idea that we could
use medical intuitives

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
in our health care system to
support diagnostics and healing

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
is world-shattering
and would completely

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:90%
revamp our health care system.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to be
able to validate this skill

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and see how we can apply it
practically in our world.
