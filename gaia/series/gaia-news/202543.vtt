>> Major advancements in
artificial intelligence,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:84%
but our computer's
learning too much too fast.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.720 align:middle line:84%
What will this mean for
the future of humanity?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:84%
The New York Times reports a
new artificial intelligence

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:84%
technology called GPT-3 has
stunned even its programmers.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
This technology operates on
what is called a neural network,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
loosely modeled on
how our brains work,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and used to predict what word
will come next in a sentence.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
After spending months studying
our language, our behavior,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and the internet,
GPT-3 learned not only

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to predict the next word
but whole paragraphs,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
writing fake blogs, tweets,
and even mimicking the writing

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:90%
style of individual people.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:10%
But perhaps, most surprising,
The New York Times

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:10%
writes, quote, "it generates
tweets, pens poetry,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:10%
summarizes emails,
answers trivia questions,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:10%
translates languages, and
even writes its own computer

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:10%
programs all with
very little prompting.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of these skills caught
even the experts off-guard."

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Computers acting just like
humans, what's the benefit?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The only benefits I could
see of creating an AI technology

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:10%
will be to help in different
fields of maybe medicine

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and different types of sciences.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:10%
But the problem with that is
how you keep control of it.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And that this thing can
become completely self-aware,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
it can then realize what does
it even need human beings

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
for if it had the capability
according to somebody's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
articles I read of even
analyzing and rewriting

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:90%
some of its own program?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is because
of the speed of the processing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
capability and its reach,
it could become extremely

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:90%
detrimental to human beings.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Meantime, other researchers
have taken things further,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
creating artificial intelligence
with the ability to manipulate.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The MIT Technology Review
reports researchers

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
at Georgia Tech and
Facebook AI, wanted

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
to make artificial
intelligence that did

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
more than generate
words for a reason.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:10%
Researchers used a
text-based video game

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:10%
where the AI was
given an objective

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:10%
and had to figure out how
to accomplish the task.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
MIT Technology
Review writes, quote,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:84%
"they train the AI to complete
quests just by using language.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
If the AI needed
a sword, it could

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
choose to steal one or
convince another character

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:90%
to hand one over."

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Computers are a major
part of modern life,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
but is this going too far?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:10%
>> They have an article about
the AI where it's being taught

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:10%
to manipulate and persuade.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
The other thing about
this that's so dangerous

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is that they can
actually manipulate

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to make you think
that it's somebody

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually not.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
They can analyze
all the information

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
on a particular person
and they can actually

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
incorporate that into itself
and become that person.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
going on here that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.610 align:middle line:84%
can be used by the
military industrial complex

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to really set people up
in ways that can put them

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.215 align:middle line:84%
in a very bad situation when
they may be totally innocent.

00:03:18.215 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we keep artificial
intelligence from turning

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
against us?

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:10%
>> If we can become conscious
enough as a people on this

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:10%
planet to prevent
this, quote, unquote,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:10%
Skynet from taking over, and
find the possible applications

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:10%
where this can be a
positive thing for humanity,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:10%
it can be a win-win
for everyone.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's an eye-opener for us and
it says to us, hey, humanity,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we need to make a
big change inside.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If artificial intelligence
really is just a reflection

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of human intelligence, with
the right parameters in place,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
could we be the masters of
our own destiny with the help

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of AI?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Think about that the next
time you post on social media.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:10%
