00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.019 align:middle line:10%
>> The long awaited government
public report on UFOs has

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.950 align:middle line:10%
finally been released.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.140 align:middle line:90%
What did we learn?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And what does it say about
the future of ufology?

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.396 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:16.856 align:middle line:90%

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.430 align:middle line:10%
As we've previously reported,
the Intelligence Authorization

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
Act for 2021 called
on the director

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
of National Intelligence
along with heads

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
of other intelligence
agencies to submit

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:10%
a report and
detailed analysis of

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
all unidentified aerial
phenomenon collected or held

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:10%
by the US government.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:10%
That report has
just been released.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope who
worked for the UK's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Ministry of Defense
investigating UFOs on what this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:10%
all means.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:10%
>> The bottom line in this
nine-page report is that, yes,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:10%
these things are real, yes,
they interact with our military

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:10%
jets, our aircraft
carriers, destroyers,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:10%
our pilots see them, our
radar operators track them.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But no, we don't have
the faintest idea

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:90%
what we're dealing with.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, that's
not good enough.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think Congress
will think it's good enough.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So the only good
news in a way, I

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
suppose I would
say this is clearly

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:90%
a preliminary assessment.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So really, we should
not think of this

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
as being any sort of definitive
position statement as opposed

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
to frankly little more
than a holding reply.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there's an acknowledgment
that there's a phenomenon,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
that it's real,
that it's definitely

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
a flight safety issue, probably
a national security issue, too.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.958 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as a
springboard for work

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be taking
place over the next few weeks

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and months.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The report highlights that
the government has not had

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.522 align:middle line:84%
a systematic way of collecting,
sharing, and analyzing data.

00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Essentially, one of the
report's key takeaways is that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.750 align:middle line:84%
there really is no uniform
data collection on this across

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the US military and the
intelligence community in its

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:90%
entirety.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
It's been piecemeal.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But it talks about how
these things are detected

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:90%
across multiple sensors.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And so again, it's radar,
it's electro-optical,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:90%
it's right across the range.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, within the US military
intelligence community,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
there is concern about this.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
things in the report

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
is the acknowledgment
that there is

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
unlikely to be a single neat
solution to the UFO mystery.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So don't expect a
single neat solution.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The government will
now classify UAPs in five

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:90%
categories--

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
airborne clutter, natural
atmospheric phenomena,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
US government or industry
developmental programs,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.110 align:middle line:84%
foreign adversary
systems, and "other".

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.108 align:middle line:10%
Nick also reminds us to
read between the lines.

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the report, we have
what is effectively a new way

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
of categorizing sightings into
a number of different baskets,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So one gets the sort
of misperceptions

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and misidentifications and
the atmospheric phenomena,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
enigmatically named "other".

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the nearest
the report actually

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
gets to discussing
extraterrestrial or alien.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are not
words that appear,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:84%
but I think again,
one has to read

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
between the lines with this.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.670 align:middle line:84%
This was never going
to be disclosure

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
as the UFO community viewed it.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
This was always going
to be an intelligence

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:90%
assessment of the phenomenon.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether this
categorization system

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to prove to be
useful or not, I don't know.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I think the trick is going to
be to try and quickly identify

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
those sightings which appear to
have a technology behind them.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And they are asking
themselves, essentially,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:90%
could this be Russia?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Could this be China?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Or could it be something else?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
If it's something
else, what is it?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:90%
What are we dealing with here?

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll have to park that and look
out for part two when it comes.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that this public
report has been issued,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.122 align:middle line:84%
what can we look forward
to in the future?

00:04:40.122 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there definitely
will be a part two.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:84%
You cannot entitle a document
preliminary assessment and then

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
not deliver the full assessment
when you've got more data

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and had a chance to take
a more considered view.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard mixed things
coming out of Congress

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.275 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
certainly welcomed it.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Others, I think, have been
a little bit more lukewarm

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and have said or implied we
were expecting a little more.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a small move
in some respects

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:90%
but it's an important one.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not
the end of the story.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
of a proper grown up,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
adult conversation about
this phenomenon, which

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
is now quite rightly not being
treated as fringe, conspiracy

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
theory, science fiction,
but is being treated

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
as what it is-- a serious
defense and national security

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.881 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Those expecting full
disclosure from this report may

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:90%
be let down.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:10%
But Nick Pope says there's
reason to be hopeful.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I understand the
disappointment of people who

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
are looking through it and
without wanting to make light

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
of it, sort of saying
to themselves, hey,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:90%
where's the aliens?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Just the existence
of this report,

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the fact that Office of
the Director of National

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence has produced this
for the United States Congress,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that this has gone
to the Intelligence

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Committee, the Armed
Services Committee,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
in both the Senate
and the House.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we should think
of this report as the iceberg.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking
at is the tip of it,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of the
really important stuff.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The classified annex, the
classified briefings going on

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
behind closed doors,
the further work

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Task

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Force is doing as we speak
to take matters forth--

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
all this is not seen and
necessarily appreciated

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:90%
by the media and the public.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.476 align:middle line:90%
So look, it's not all bad news.

00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This short preliminary
assessment may leave some

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
readers wanting more, but Nick
Pope has advice for readers

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:90%
of the report.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though it's only nine
pages, it's worth reading,

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
reading twice, setting aside,
coming back to it a third time.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And every time, you know,
particularly if you're

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
reading this as
somebody who's had

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
any background in the
military and government,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
this is not just objects
unexplained, case closed.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This is objects
unexplained, what the heck?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.621 align:middle line:10%
You know, we need
to engage on this.

00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Not too long ago, the serious
study of UFOs or UAPs was seen

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:90%
as fringe or science fiction.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:10%
This report shows it is
now being taken seriously.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:10%
And as Senator Marco Rubio
said in his statement,

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:10%
"This report is an
important first step

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:10%
in cataloging these incidents,
but it is just a first step."

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:90%
This is just the beginning.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:84%
We'll be watching
for what comes next.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.472 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:07:57.472 --> 00:07:58.272 align:middle line:90%
