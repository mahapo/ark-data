00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>> October 2021, a massive
solar flare unleashed a blast

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:10%
of charged particles
in Earth's direction.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Did this powerful
solar event also open

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.660 align:middle line:90%
temporary energetic portals?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.165 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:10%
On October 28, a category
three geomagnetic storm

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:10%
erupted from the sun's
surface, reaching Earth

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
a few days later.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
A level three geomagnetic
storm is considered strong

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and can result in
minor disturbances

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to high-frequency radio
signals and low-frequency radio

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:90%
navigation.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:10%
It also leads to auroras,
visible at much lower latitudes

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.815 align:middle line:10%
than usual, including as
far south as Oregon and even

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:56.615 align:middle line:10%
Illinois.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:10%
Matias De Stefano, host of
Gaia series "Initiation,"

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.920 align:middle line:10%
happened to be in Oregon during
this profound solar event.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:10%
>> These storms from the
magnetic field of the sun

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
affect all the planets around.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
they hit Earth,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:84%
they change the pattern of the
magnetic field of this planet.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So that opens
portals all the time.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
It moves the energy
of the planet

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and makes the symmetrical
patterns to restore,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:90%
to readapt to something new.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2012, NASA published a
paper titled "Hidden Portals

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:10%
in Earth's Magnetic Field"
in which it explained that

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:10%
a scientist had discovered what
the Space Agency refers to as X

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:10%
points, or portals where
the magnetic field of Earth

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:10%
connects to the sun.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:10%
According to Jack Scudder,
the lead physicist who

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:10%
discovered these
portals, this phenomenon

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:10%
creates an
uninterrupted connection

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:10%
to the sun's atmosphere
93 million miles away.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But what effect does this
have for us here on Earth?

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>> When the solar flares
occur, everything is much more

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:10%
sensitive and faster.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing to do is to
have-- to be perfectly aligned

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
with the positive and
negative in our own body,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
so we can be channels.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And that means to be
meditating and discharging

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
all this energy going
towards the Earth,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
or the portal we
are working with.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Earth typically experiences
periods of heightened solar

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
activity in 11-year cycles.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And scientists are
predicting a ramping up

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of solar activity
in the coming years,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
leading to the next solar
maximum in July 2025.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this a cause for concern?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:10%
>> If it goes straight
to us, of course,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:10%
it could create many
problems in communications

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:10%
and in the internet, the
technology of the planet,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:10%
satellites, everything
could shut down.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we could be
concerned about that.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't be
really worried.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I just would get prepared
for that in just--

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
just in case.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, having the food, and
having all the normal things

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
when something happens that
you should take care of.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:10%
But I wouldn't
really get worried

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:10%
about something terrible
happening, because this

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:10%
happens every 11 years.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What else can we learn
from these solar flares

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and the portals
they open on Earth?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> These cycles
that we are living--

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is living--
is something that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:90%
injects energy to the planet.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The solar flares that
will arrive in 2025

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
will be much more stronger
for us than the previous one.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of new
energy that could

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
help us to build
new philosophies

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and new civilizations, new
technology, many things that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:84%
could change if we know
how to receive them.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the next few years, we
will continue to see increased

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:84%
activity from the sun,
culminating in the peak

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of the current
11-year cycle in 2025.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
While some have
expressed concern

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
with the effect this may have
on the power grid and satellite

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
communications, others
view it as a time

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to become more connected
with the planet

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
by aligning our
bodies to receive

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
solar energetic
downloads transmitted

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
through literal portals that
connect our planet to the sun.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:10%
