00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Stress is part of life.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.850 align:middle line:10%
But before it gets
to be too much,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.310 align:middle line:10%
it's time to take
care of yourself.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Self-care is not selfish.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:90%
We all experience stress.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:90%
It's hardwired into our DNA.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
The fight or flight response
is within each of us.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you've been
cooped up too long

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.390 align:middle line:84%
or events outside your control
weigh too heavily on your mind,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:90%
it can all be too much.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Mental stress can have
serious negative effects

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:90%
on your physical health.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
That is why it's important
to take care of yourself,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
take care of others.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Or if you are the type of
empath that others lean on,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:90%
you need to take a break.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.045 align:middle line:84%
To help others, you must
first help yourself.

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:10%
Naturopathic medical
doctor, Donese Worden,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:10%
on stress and our bodies.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:10%
>> It helps us guide us
into that next phase.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:10%
When it becomes
a problem is when

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:10%
it's chronic, when it's just
continual level of stress.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:84%
When we have that,
we build up cortisol

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
hormones that affect

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
our sex hormones,
testosterone, progesterone,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
estrogen for men and women.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got a mess
with a hormone balance,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and it happened
really from stress.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Many other things
that it causes.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to remember
that our body's pretty smart.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that stress in
a short period of time,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
even if it's really high,
can be helpful for us.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the physical
effects of chronic stress?

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the effects of
chronic stress is your body

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:84%
thinks it needs to run
from the bear all the time.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
That it's in fight
or flight, and it

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get into the
parasympathetic, which is

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
where we heal and repair DNA.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we're turned on
in that stress piece,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and literally telling
our body we're in danger,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
all of those good things get
shut off for the sake of,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
let's survive.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
When we do that, it
causes inflammation,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:90%
the stress hormones rise.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it selfish to want to
take a break when you are taking

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:90%
care of other people?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Self-care is not
something that you're doing

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that's selfish.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you care for
others if you are not

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
caring for yourself?

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Why do we think,
one of our tenants

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
as a physician is
physician heal thyself?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:10%
We have to learn not only how to
help ourselves to help others,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:10%
but we also have
to have the energy

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:10%
to have the empathy and the
ability to care for others.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:10%
Social workers are high on
the list, my cancer patients.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It's their caretakers
that burn out

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
before the patients that have
the life-threatening illnesses.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:10%
So we have to
remember that and know

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:10%
that if you're in the
driver's seat for the moment

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:10%
to help someone else, you
can only do it if you're

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.210 align:middle line:10%
taking care of yourself.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Chronic stress
can cause insomnia.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And lack of sleep
adds to stress.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
How do we break
this vicious cycle?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Insomnia is one of the things
that will really work against

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:90%
us in any situation.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Without sleep, our brain can't
detox, our body can't repair,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
we can't make
hormones, we can't get

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the anti-inflammatory
molecules going,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:90%
we can't repair our own DNA.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
All of that happens when
we're telling our body,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to be
in survival mode,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
we're in peaceful safe mode.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's miraculous
what the body can do.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But we need meditation
time and we need sleep time

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:90%
for that to happen.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't need a spa
weekend for self care.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
To recharge, sometimes it takes
as little as five minutes.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many studies
that prove that listening

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to your favorite music,
taking a walk in nature,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:84%
even carving out five minutes
to really do something that you

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
enjoy, if it's meditation, if
it's exercise, whatever it is.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have 30 minutes,
maybe you have an hour,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
but don't think that five
minutes won't do anything

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It will, it can.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Even a couple of
very deep breaths

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
can be really
restorative for you.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we get
stressed, we forget to breathe.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> If it all feels like
too much right now,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
what can one do if we feel
like we are spiraling?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you spend more time
in what you can do right now

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
instead of what you can't do,
you'll be empowered to say,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
hey, I'm going to come out of
this and I'm and have learned

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:84%
something and I'll be a
wiser person because of it.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:90%
And, I'll be stronger.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are feeling the
effects of chronic stress,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
remember you must take care
of yourself to be able to care

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
for others.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Even a few minutes of
meditation, yoga or walking

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in nature can help
you reset and be

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
ready to face the
challenges ahead.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:10%
