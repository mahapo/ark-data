00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.820 align:middle line:10%
>> One mystery of Stonehenge
may have been solved.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.460 align:middle line:84%
What a legend about Merlin the
magician, giants, and magic

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
could teach us about
history and archaeology.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.305 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
Stones used to construct the
first phase of Stonehenge

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
may have come from
Western Wales,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:10%
more than 100 miles away.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And their journey may
have been explained

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:90%
by a 900-year-old legend.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
The so-called
bluestones of Stonehenge

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
form the inner horseshoe,
not the iconic trilithons

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:90%
that form the outer circle.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:10%
But this interior
area is believed

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.970 align:middle line:10%
to be the first section
of Stonehenge, built

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:10%
about 5,000 years ago.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:10%
For some time, experts have
theorized the bluestones

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:10%
originally came from Wales.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:10%
But in a new paper by
archaeologist Mike Parker

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Pearson published in
the journal "Antiquity,"

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:10%
Pearson and his
colleagues proposed

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:10%
that the stones not
only came from Wales

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:10%
but from a previously-existing
stone circle at a site

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:10%
called Waun Mawn
in southwest Wales.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:10%
This new information
lends credence

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:10%
to a 900-year-old legend, that
the bluestones in Stonehenge

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:10%
came from a stone
circle in Ireland.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:10%
At that time, southwest
Wales was considered Ireland.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
In the legend, the
circle was dismantled

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
by Merlin the magician
and rebuilt in England.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
In some stories, Giants
may have been involved.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:10%
Hugh Newman,
researcher and author

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:10%
of "Stone Circles" on the
legends surrounding Stonehenge.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that
particularly interests me is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:10%
the fact that, if you
look at the legends,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:10%
they talk about this very
tall almost giant race who are

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:10%
involved in building
these sites.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And the tradition is
that giants brought them

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
over from North Africa
to Killaraus in Ireland,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
or potentially Wales.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Then Merlin, thousands
of years later,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
transported them on his
own using magical means

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.425 align:middle line:90%
to Wilkshire.

00:02:22.425 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got to
look at these legends

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
again and kind of have a
bit of reality to this.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The bluestones weigh tons.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
How could they have been
transported 5,000 years ago?

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a coastal theory
that they took it to the coast

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:10%
in Wales, they put it on
boats, went all the way around,

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:10%
and brought into land on them.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But the tradition states
that Merlin brought them.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
And he did it on his own.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
either a technology,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
a secret technology, which
would have looked like magic

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient people.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Or he actually was able
to levitate the stones

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and control their movement
through magical means.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:10%
I kind of go with the
Merlin theory, personally.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Could they have used sound
to move the massive stones?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:10%
>> There are stories of
using acoustics, using sound.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.007 align:middle line:84%
And this could have vibrated
the stone at such a level

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that it could have made
it kind of levitate.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It could have made
it become weightless.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:10%
This may have been one of the
techniques combined, I believe,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:10%
with the power of the mind.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:90%
This is where Merlin comes in.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
We know many of these sites were
actually designed acoustically.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So they actually had
acoustic resonance

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
within the sites
themselves, which would

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:90%
resonate with the human voice.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
That alone could have created
kind of areas of anti-gravity.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Whatever means they used
to transport the stones,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:10%
why did these ancient
people bring the large,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:10%
heavy stones over
such a great distance?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:10%
What significance did they hold?

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:10%
Science and history
writer Andrew Collins.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason why these stones
might have been brought all

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:10%
the way from west Wales to
Salisbury Plain to create

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:10%
Stonehenge goes back to
the idea of the ancestors.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But quite clearly, if these
people living in Wales

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
decided that they wanted
to change their territory,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to migrate, then clearly, they
wanted to bring the ancestors

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> This story has been around
for 900 years but not taken

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Does this prove we should
listen to the legends?

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Legends themselves are
often dismissed by academics.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:10%
But we know that Heinrich
Schliemann, the German explorer

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:10%
who discovered the
city of Troy, was also

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:10%
following myths and
legends that led him

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:10%
to a particular
location which allowed

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:10%
him to excavate and find the
remains of this fabled city

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:10%
of the past.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So these legends are crucial in
preserving ancient knowledge.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And we should never,
ever ignore them.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are we still so
fascinated by Stonehenge?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.546 align:middle line:84%
>> It resonates with people
because, in my opinion,

00:05:29.546 --> 00:05:33.185 align:middle line:84%
it's one of the remaining
artifacts of our ancestors.

00:05:33.185 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
grasp, we're trying

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand
where we came from.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And places like
Stonehenge kind of

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
give us a glimpse into their
mindset, into, like, brilliance

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that they once had.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:10%
>> There is so much to discover
and learn about this place.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the interest in
it is going to go anyway soon.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.080 align:middle line:90%
It may be awkward.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But at least in
this case, it seems

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to have helped lead
to a new finding.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps myths,
legends, and folklore

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:10%
could be the keys to other
discoveries around the world.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:10%
