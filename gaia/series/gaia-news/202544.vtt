>> Hundreds of thousands of
visitors are flocking to a site

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.420 align:middle line:10%
known as the Bosnian pyramids,
discovered in 2005 by Semir

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.870 align:middle line:10%
Osmanagic.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When he announced this
collection of hills

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.130 align:middle line:84%
were built by an
ancient civilization,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Osmanagic became an
international celebrity.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:10%
His theories have since
been dismissed and attacked

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:10%
by mainstream academics.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam TV's Regina Meredith
traveled to Bosnia

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
for an exclusive
interview with Osmanagic

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.153 align:middle line:84%
to learn more about these
mysterious landmarks.

00:00:31.153 --> 00:00:33.931 align:middle line:90%

00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.417 align:middle line:10%
>> There are five basic factors
that are involved in deciding

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:10%
and deciphering whether or not
something is a genuine pyramid.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Just run through
those really quickly,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.827 align:middle line:10%
and then we'll get
to the science.

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So if you want to
call something a pyramid,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:10%
you have to have geometry.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Usually it's four sides,
triangular faces, corners,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:90%
the same slope.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what we have in the
case of the Bosnian pyramids.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
The second are the orientation.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
All pyramids in
China, 250 of them,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
are oriented to
the cosmic north.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So far we thought
the best orientation

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
is the northern side of
the Great Pyramid of Egypt,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
with an error of 0
degrees and 2 minutes.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So precise.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
But in our case, the State
Institute for Geography

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
came to the top of the
same pyramid in Bosnia,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
measured it, and concluded that
the error to the perfect north

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.407 align:middle line:84%
is at 0 degrees 0 minutes,
and only 12 seconds.

00:01:33.407 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> More precise than
the Giza pyramid.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just a fraction
of 1 minute.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the most precise
orientation ever on the planet.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The element number
three, you have

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to have artificial
construction material.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:90%
In Peru they use adobe bricks.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
In Guatemala they
shaped volcanic stones.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%
In Mexico, limestone.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, limestone
in the granite.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
In Bosnia, they made
concrete blocks.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
This is our archaeological
trench number 4C.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We have removed approximately
one meter of layers of soil.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we
discovered the blocks.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
one to be discovered.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The blocks, which is
rectangular in the shape,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
4 and 1/2 meters in
length, 1 and 1/2

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:90%
in width, 45 centimeters thick.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It has seven 7 tons,
or 16,000 pounds.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The element number
four, inner passageways.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Our French geophysicist and
the georadar specialists

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:84%
from Germany, Russia,
Austria, and Serbia,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
they did prove that there is
a network of inner passageways

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and chambers inside
the pyramids.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The element number five,
underground tunnels.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
underground panels as part

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
of the whole construction.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:90%
We had a wall here, 2010.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
It was completely closed.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And then we hit another wall.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:90%
We removed the wall.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:90%
We removed the material.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
first time, we found

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:84%
two open sections,
one to the left,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
45 meters, one to the right,
200 meters, open, opened.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have construction
and structures

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:90%
above and below the ground.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have a big master
plan when they started

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
building the whole project.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the element is
also important, the water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to have water
above the ground,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
underground water streams.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
You always have the water.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You see the lake is about
150 square feet of surface,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and about a couple
of feet in depth.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you see the water there?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that's the
reflective surface.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, uh-huh.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there's the water.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When the pyramid works it
acts also as a water pump.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It sucks the water.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%
The water circles everywhere.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.995 align:middle line:84%
So these are very interesting,
not only structure, but as

00:03:53.995 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we proved here in
Bosnia, the machines.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now we get to, to
me, just the astounding part

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You had more analysis
done on organic material.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe you
said it was trapped

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:84%
between the outer surface,
blocks of the pyramid,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and the sand, and
everything that's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.020 align:middle line:84%
come over time to
revegetate the area.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And you had that analyzed.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Because that would
tell you a lot, right?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And exclusively for you guys
I can give you the results.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:84%
The results is 24,800 years,
plus, minus 200 years.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So we are going
back 25,000 years.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.553 align:middle line:84%
So this is the minimum age of
the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> This is astounding.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It forever changes our
view of the ancient history.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it ever.
