>> New studies show that
optimism is linked to living

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.860 align:middle line:84%
longer and those who feel
younger rehabilitate from

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.660 align:middle line:90%
injury faster.

Health research has always
been overwhelmingly focused

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:10%
on risk factors that
may predispose people

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:10%
to disease and premature death.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
The ever-growing field
of positive psychology,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:10%
however, is focused on
those positive attributes

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
and behaviors which
can on their own

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:10%
promote health and longevity.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
One such recent study, out
of the Harvard Chan School

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
of Public Health, looked
at the trait of optimism

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
as experienced by a group
of women, ages 50 to 79,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
several decades.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:84%
The study was unique
in that it studied

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
a large cohort of
people across a variety

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
of racial and ethnic
groups, to understand

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
whether optimism is affected
by such social structures.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
At the completion of
this multi-year study,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:10%
findings showed that
the 25% of participants

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:10%
who displayed the
most optimism were

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:10%
likely to have a
5.5% longer lifespan

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:10%
and a 10% greater likelihood
of living beyond 90 years.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:10%
These results were found to
have no correlation with race

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:10%
or ethnicity.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And, quite interestingly,
researchers

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:84%
found that lifestyle factors,
such as regular exercise

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and healthy eating, accounted
for less than a quarter

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
of the optimism
lifespan association.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The trait of optimism
also seems to be at play

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
in another recent study.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
In this investigation,
researchers

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
set out to study
whether subjective age,

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or how old people
feel, is connected

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:90%
to how well they heal.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
The study, conducted by
Bar-Ilan University in Israel,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
tracked nearly 200 seniors
undergoing rehabilitation

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:90%
from fractures or stroke.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Patients were interviewed
throughout about

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
their subjective age.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:10%
The findings revealed that
those who felt younger

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:10%
at hospital admission
had considerably better

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:10%
physical outcomes at
discharge one month later.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:10%
Researchers also found
that those who felt younger

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:10%
recovered better because
they were more optimistic

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:10%
about their outcomes.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Most surprising is
that subjective age

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
was the strongest predictor
of positive outcomes,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
even more so than
patients' chronological age

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:90%
and other health conditions.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The study findings
will hopefully

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.530 align:middle line:84%
lead to the design and
implementation of mental health

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.520 align:middle line:84%
strategies to positively
affect people's subjective age

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and a reminder
that how you think

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
can play a major
role in how you feel.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:10%
