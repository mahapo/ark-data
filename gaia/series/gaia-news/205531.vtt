00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.060 align:middle line:10%
>> As the countdown to the
release of the government

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.530 align:middle line:10%
report on UFOs intensifies, new
developments reveal just how

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:10%
uncoordinated the
response has been.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.866 align:middle line:10%
This is "Gaia News."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
With new reports on
unidentified aerial phenomenon

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:84%
coming forward almost daily,
some from high-level officials,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
mainstream media has
gotten in on the coverage.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:84%
As Washington prepares
for the report release

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
at the end of June, the
issue has turned from farce

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to serious inquiry.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And now many questions
are being raised

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
as to the government's
handling of the matter.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope ran the British
Ministry of Defence's UFO

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:10%
project, where he conducted
official investigations

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:10%
into the phenomenon in the UK.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:10%
Having worked within
these infrastructures,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:10%
he gives us his take on the
lead-up to the US UFO report.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>> There are factions here, and
there's a struggle for control

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:10%
of the narrative.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And the believer faction
is making its move

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.080 align:middle line:90%
but is getting some pushback.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Really what's happening
is, of course,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
the struggle for control
of the narrative when

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the report
going to Congress.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is drafting
that for director

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of National Intelligence,
and that's probably

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Task

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Force in the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're not necessarily
speaking with one voice,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's leaking going
on as well, which is always

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
a sign that there's disagreement
over the handling of this

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:90%
within government.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Recent handling of this
policy is 180 degree different

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
from the previous
policy of denial

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and debunking, which
suggests the faction who

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
thinks we need to
get this out there,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:84%
put the information
into the public domain.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And that faction is
certainly struggling

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:90%
for power and authority.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
blood on the carpet

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
at Office of Director
of National Intelligence

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and at the Pentagon on this.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So very interesting
times for sure.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Another clear sign of
this internal divisiveness is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:84%
the three new inspector
general investigations into how

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the government has been
managing the whole issue.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:10%
And at the center of
these investigations

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:10%
is Luis Elizondo, a former
military intelligence officer

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:10%
who, according to some, ran
AATIP, the secret government

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:10%
program to investigate UFOs.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
He's also credited
with bringing forward

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
the three military
videos of UFOs

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
featured on the front page of
"The New York Times" in 2017.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Luis Elizondo is, I think,
the classic all-American hero.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Joined the military,
secunded certainly

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
into various different
intelligence roles

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and working with various
different agencies

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:90%
on a huge variety of subjects.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
His involvement with
AATIP is what brought him

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:90%
to public attention.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And certainly "The
New York Times"

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
breaking the story about
AATIP in the US Navy videos

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is what catapulted him
into people's awareness.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
feeling is that there

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
are people still in the system
who are briefing against him.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:90%
And he obviously-- rightly--

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:90%
feels slighted by this.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:10%
>> In response to
these aspersions,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:10%
Luis Elizondo has
recently retained renowned

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:10%
constitutional lawyer
Daniel Sheehan.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:10%
>> So there was this
whole back-and-forth with

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:10%
representations being made
by certain people inside

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:10%
the Defense Department
indicating that somehow Lou

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:10%
Elizondo was not telling
the truth about the videos.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even acknowledge
that the videos were genuine.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So there was this whole
period of confusion

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:90%
that went on in there.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
But when it got settled
down and actual officials

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
from the Defense
Department acknowledged

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the validity of the videos, that
became an entire second round

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of news, a news cycle.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh wow, now look, the Pentagon
has actually confirmed this.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But there were still elements
inside the Defense Department

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
that kept on, strangely
enough, asserting

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.242 align:middle line:90%
that, well, it wasn't true.

00:04:24.242 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And then they started
taking the position

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that Lou Elizondo
was misrepresenting

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
the mission of the Advanced
Aerospace Threat Identification

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Project.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:84%
What Lou is trying to do
is to have me assist him

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
in getting some clear
clarification of what

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the level of hierarchy
is inside the Defense

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Department with regard to
what the official position is.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> To Daniel Sheehan, this
inconsistency in handling has

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
been a recurring pattern.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:10%
>> It's obvious that
there has been a--

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.012 align:middle line:10%
not a perfectly
coordinated program

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:10%
coming from the Defense
Department, the Central

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence Agency, the
National Security Agency,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:10%
and others, who have
been on again, off again

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:10%
about this whole subject.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And that they're engaged
in some sort of an attempt

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to feather into
the public culture

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:90%
information about this subject.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
One of our objectives
in this is trying

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
to figure out where they're
at in that particular strategy

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Pope feels like there
is in fact a strategic objective

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a playbook.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Some of the statements that
you hear look and sound

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
scripted, and that's
because they are.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But as to the why, that is
much more difficult to discern.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think one possible answer
is people within government,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
they know or suspect
that something is coming.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whether that
is literally something

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
physical and a rival
event of some sort,

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
simply the disclosure

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of historical
information, I don't know.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:10%
There comes a point where
the critical mass of a secret

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:10%
becomes such that
the dam bursts,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:10%
and I think we're
at that point now.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:10%
>> For Daniel Sheehan,
there's a much bigger picture

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:10%
to consider.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:10%
>> This is such an
extraordinarily important issue

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:10%
for our human family.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.930 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the next
5,000 years of human history

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
here and what our
relationship may

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
be with an extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is a critical point
in our human history right now.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> For now, we'll just have to
wait and see if the government

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
report will shed some light or
just lead to more questions.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
