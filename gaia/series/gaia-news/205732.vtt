>> Turkey just made an
announcement about a major

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.870 align:middle line:10%
archeological discovery
at Gobekli Tepe.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Could this finally shed light
on who built the world's oldest

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.350 align:middle line:90%
megalithic site, and why?

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.140 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.330 align:middle line:84%
First unearthed in 1995, the
11,000-year old excavation site

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe has yielded
the most significant collection

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of stone pillar monoliths
ever discovered.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:84%
While most archeologists
agree that the structure is

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the world's oldest
temple, they have long

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.530 align:middle line:84%
debated the origins and
motivations of its builders.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:10%
The recent findings
of 11, possibly

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:10%
12 new sites around Gobekli
Tepe may provide those answers.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins is an
ancient history researcher

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.766 align:middle line:84%
who has written
extensively about the site.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe
is, in many ways,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:10%
the best evidence that we
have of a lost civilization,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
a pre-Ice Age civilization
that existed worldwide and was

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:10%
probably wiped out by the very
harsh conditions and possibly

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
some kind of comet impact
about 13,000 years ago.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And that the sole
remnants of this

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:90%
went on to create Gobekli Tepe.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And this was constructed
from around 9,600

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
BC down to about
8,000 BC by what

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been
hunter-gatherers who had not

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:90%
even invented agriculture.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Little is known about these
people but researchers have

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
theories about
their motivations.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The best evidence would seem
to suggest that the creation

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
of places like Gobekli Tepe and
probably other similar sites

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
in that region was the response
to this cataclysm that has

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%
happened twice.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
what they wanted to do

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
was to have some kind
of failsafe mechanism

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to allow their shamans to
enter into the other world

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and deal with the supernatural
creatures that they believed

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
were responsible for cataclysms.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
creatures, I'm talking

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
about their visible
manifestation

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
in the sky as comets.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What is clear about the
builders is their remarkable

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.866 align:middle line:90%
technological savvy.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The builders of Gobekli
Tepe would seem to have been

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
technologically
advanced in many ways.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Not just from the
point of view of being

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
able to create
these huge monuments

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
with these T-shaped
terminations,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
but they had the
skill to be able to do

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful
high relief carvings

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the stone.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But on top of this was
the smaller objects

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to create
beautiful stone jewelry.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And this and many
other skills tell us

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.576 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
a high tech culture here.

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The significance of this,
according to some scholars is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:90%
far reaching.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You will find in this
area evidence of this lost

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
civilization that basically
seeded us with the rudiments

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
of civilization that are
remembered as being given to us

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
by the Watchers of
the Book of Enoch,

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki of
Sumerian ancient texts,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the so-called immortals
of Iranian mythology.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
All of these things were
invented by the peoples

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
that made Gobekli Tepe.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Given this, the importance
of finding out more about this

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
civilization cannot
be overestimated,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
which is why the recent findings
at the site are being met with

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.372 align:middle line:90%
such excitement.

00:04:13.372 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What has been announced
by the director of operations

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe is that his
team have discovered 11,

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
although he also
refers to them as 12,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
different sites that would
seem to be in a circle around

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
referring to here are

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
so-called occupational maps.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And these are huge mounds
of earth and human debris.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:84%
They're like layer
cakes of human activity.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And what would
happen is that people

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
would build maybe their houses
or enclosures or whatever,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and they would then cover
them up, and either build next

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to them or build on top of them.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
gradually create

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.218 align:middle line:90%
these huge occupational mounds.

00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:10%
>> The findings of the
investigations of these mounds

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:10%
have not yet been made public.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
researchers have ideas

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
about what they could yield.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The new findings at Gobekli
Tepe will give us our first

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:10%
information about who the
builders were of Gobekli Tepe

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:10%
because it is extremely likely
that the 12 sites around

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:10%
the mine hill of which
Gobekli Tepe stands was where

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:10%
the builders lived.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So we will find
evidence of their bones,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
we'll find evidence
of their technologies,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and this will give
us information

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.522 align:middle line:84%
about where they came from
because this is a big mystery.

00:06:02.522 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Some experts also believe
these new mounds may shed some

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:84%
light on the world views of
the people who live there.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What is being suggested is
that there could be a symbolic

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
value in the amount of 12
occupational mounds that is

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:90%
being used.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic, it has
some kind of value.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We divide up the
heavens into 12 parts,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:84%
so what it tells us is
that Gobekli Tepe may

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
have represented
the point of meeting

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:90%
between heaven and Earth.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason
why the symbolism of 12

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
is reflected in the
use of 12 stones.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And why there might have been 12
settlements around the outside

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Gobekli Tepe.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very
significant because it tells us

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that the mindset of
the Gobekli builders

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
was one that was totally fixed
on symbolism and the heavens.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that we should be looking
for answers up there in space

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.218 align:middle line:84%
as to exactly what was
going on at Gobekli Tepe.

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Excitement is building
for the forthcoming findings,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
which are hoped to provide
a deeper understanding

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of the fascinating lost
civilization from which we may

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:90%
have been seeded.
