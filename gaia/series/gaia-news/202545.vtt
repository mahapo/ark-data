00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410 align:middle line:10%
>> In an attempt to know how
organic versus conventional

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:10%
farmed food impacts the
health and development

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:10%
of our children, the American
Academy of Pediatrics conducted

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:10%
an intensive study.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:10%
The report finds
multiple positives

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
for organic consumption but
says the effects of pesticides

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
on human health over a lifetime
still have not been studied.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
To talk more about
this, I spoke earlier

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.412 align:middle line:10%
with Robin O'Brien, a leading
children's health advocate.

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>> First off, Robin,
let's just clarify--

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.853 align:middle line:10%
what is certified organic as
opposed to conventional food?

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a really
great question,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.562 align:middle line:10%
because when I was first
starting to look into the food

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:10%
supply and the recent changes
and new ingredients that have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:10%
been introduced, I thought the
organic symbol was really just

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:10%
a marketing tool that was
slapped on a product that was

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:10%
more expensive.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
But what I learned is that it's
actually a legal representation

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:10%
and that by law, that symbol
means that that product has

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:10%
been produced without the use
of artificial growth hormones,

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:10%
artificial dyes,
high-fructose corn syrup,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:10%
genetically
engineered ingredients

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:10%
that have been made to withstand
increasing doses of pesticides.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And so really, what it means
is that that form of production

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:90%
adheres to a legal standard.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And then if those farmers are
in violation of that standard,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
they're fined for it.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
a seal of approval.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Pesticide-free?

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:10%
>> No, not pesticide-free,
but genetically engineered

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:10%
ingredients are not allowed
to be used in the production

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.080 align:middle line:10%
method.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at that,
you're like, OK, well, here's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:84%
this list of
ingredients that aren't

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.043 align:middle line:90%
allowed into organic food.

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at that list
of ingredients, a lot of them

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
are pretty new, introduced in
the last, say, 20 or 30 years.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:10%
So what we're calling
organic food today--

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:10%
our grandmothers, they
just called it food.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, right.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:10%
So unfortunately,
this study shows

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:10%
that there hasn't
been enough studies

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:10%
of the impact of the pesticides
over a person's lifetime.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:10%
But what pediatricians
are saying

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:10%
is that they definitely know
that pesticides significantly

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:10%
affect the development of
children, in their brains

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:10%
particularly.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, exactly.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And again, these pesticides--
we started with one

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:10%
set of pesticides, and we
introduced a new level.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.797 align:middle line:10%
And we're constantly
engineering new pesticides,

00:02:19.797 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:10%
synthetically creating
them in these laboratories.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And so they're
advancing as rapidly

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.530 align:middle line:10%
as the food industry is itself.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:10%
And what we're realizing is that
as we have modified and changed

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and synthetically produced
all of these new classes

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:10%
of chemicals and
synthetic pesticides,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:10%
we have no idea what the
long-term effect of that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:10%
is going to be.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And the concern right now
is on the developing system

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of a child, whether it's the
developing immune system,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the developing nervous
system, or the developing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
digestive system.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.218 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what those
long-term impacts are.

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears that this study
was done with the mission

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to determine, at least
for the pediatrician.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And so how to talk to
parents and advise them

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
what is a wise food choice?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
What is this truly saying?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
Do we need to be concerned?

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think what we're
realizing is that we're waking

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
up to the fact that the
landscape of childhood has

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
changed and that when you're
dealing with the record number

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
of children we now have
with autism or allergies

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
or diabetes-- or cancer is
the leading cause of death

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:90%
by disease in kids--

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that is completely
changing childhood.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
It's changing a practice
for a pediatrician,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's changing
everything for a parent.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
the landscape of food

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.653 align:middle line:84%
has changed really
dramatically when

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you consider that we
recently introduced

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.612 align:middle line:84%
these genetically engineered
ingredients into our food.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got increasing
doses of pesticides

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.582 align:middle line:84%
being poured on our food
crops out in the field.

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
We've got high-fructose
corn syrup, which

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.718 align:middle line:90%
was introduced in the '70s.

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame, the
artificial sweetener--

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:90%
that was introduced in the '80s.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
These are relatively
new ingredients.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
maybe has happened

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.680 align:middle line:84%
is that perhaps for the American
Academy of Pediatrics, where

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they were schooled one
way for a very long time,

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
they're suddenly confronting
these changes in their practice

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I think this
effort with this study

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:84%
was as much to school them as
it was to school the rest of us

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Appreciate it.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:10%
