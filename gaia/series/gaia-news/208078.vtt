>> Could supernatural
entities encountered during

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.140 align:middle line:10%
a psychedelic trip be
responsible for the dramatic

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.140 align:middle line:10%
psychological healing
that many report?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:90%
New research seeks to find out.

>> You're getting
this very positive,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
loving kindness feeling,
feeling supported,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
feeling cared about or
observed in some way.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
What's very common
is that you're

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
going to encounter
one of these things.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:84%
DMT, or N,
N-dimethyltryptamine, is widely

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:84%
considered the Earth's
most powerful hallucinogen.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the latest
psychedelic to be clinically

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
studied for its potential to
treat mental health issues

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:90%
like major depression and PTSD.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
One frequently occurring
phenomenon of the DMT trip

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
researchers are
particularly interested in

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
is the appearance of entities
whom experiencers often credit

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:90%
with the healing they receive.

Jay Waxenberg is the director of
the DMTx program at the Center

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.415 align:middle line:90%
for Medicinal Mindfulness.

00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Based in Boulder, Colorado, it
was one of the first centers

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to offer legal psychedelic
therapy in the US.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The entities are really
this unique aspect of DMT.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:10%
And they play different
roles for different people

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.320 align:middle line:10%
in that space.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:10%
But what's very
common is that one,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:10%
you're going to encounter
one of these things, and two,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to feel
like they're giving you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:10%
some piece of
information to take back

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:10%
to the regular
consensus reality, also

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:10%
that they are benevolent,
lots of love and kindness.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
These are very common
elements for the entities.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And we have linguistic models to
kind of relate to those spaces,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
whether they're elves
or imps or fairies.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They could be angels,
bodhisattvas, aliens,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.600 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional beings.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
people will come back and say,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of what
that felt like.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of
what that thing is.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The groundwork for current
research on the topic was laid

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:10%
by Dr. Rick Strassmann,
psychiatrist and pioneering

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic researcher, who
first described these entities

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:10%
in his book, "DMT--

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:10%
The Spirit Molecule."

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The beings were beneficent.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:10%
They did healing.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:10%
They gave advice.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Some predicted or showed
volunteers the future.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:10%
Some were examining
the volunteers.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.740 align:middle line:10%
But one of the hallmarks
of the interaction

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:10%
was the strength
of those beings.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> A recent study surveyed 2,500
individuals who encountered

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:90%
entities after taking DMT.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:10%
The researchers
found that, quote,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:10%
"The experiences were rated
as among the most meaningful,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:10%
spiritual, and
psychologically insightful

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:10%
lifetime experiences,
with persisting

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:10%
positive changes in life
satisfaction, purpose,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:10%
and meaning attributed
to the experiences."

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> People will refer to
the entities as guides,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, that they're
trying to teach something

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:84%
or give some piece
of information.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You're getting this very
positive, loving kindness

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
feeling, feeling supported,
feeling cared about or observed

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And that comes back and
can be really beneficial.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the groundwork
of like, wow, I am loved.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Or I am supported
in some kind of way.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you can build
on that therapeutically.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of
theories about the nature

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
of these DMT entities,
from neuroscience research

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
into activation of specific
brain regions to more

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical ideas about
extradimensional visitations.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The most mundane explanation
of what these things could be,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I think, comes from Carl Jung,
who talks about the collective

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:84%
unconscious and autonomous
pieces of the collective

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:90%
unconscious.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interacting
with an archetypal energy,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.940 align:middle line:84%
like the warrior, the
healer, whatever that is,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:84%
that interaction itself
can be the healing.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Further research into
this space is underway.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:10%
For Jay Waxenberg and his
team at Medicinal Mindfulness,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:10%
that will take the form of a
fascinating new program called

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
DMTx.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So DMTx, the X
being extended--

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
so we're looking to
extend the DMT state.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
We're really focusing
in on the fact

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that these experiences,
like the peak experience,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:90%
is less than five minutes.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes
to therapeutic benefit

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
or problem-solving
or even understanding

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
if that space is real or
these entities are real,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
five minutes is
not really enough.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.015 align:middle line:90%
DMTx is kind of--

00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
we're pioneering the research
that Rick Strassmann and Andrew

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Gallimore wrote up, which is
this pharmacokinetic model

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of basically putting
an anesthesia machine

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and running DMT through that
and keeping somebody in the DMT

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
state for extended
periods of time to allow,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
essentially, more healing
and more understanding

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
of that space to maybe
even possibly map

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:90%
that space in some capacity.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> As DMT is still considered a
Schedule I controlled substance

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in the US, the DMTx program will
take place in a country such

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
as Jamaica where this
kind of use is legal.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
For proponents of
DMT therapy, hopes

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
are high that exploration
will yield definitive findings

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
about the therapeutic
value of the psychedelic

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.000 align:middle line:84%
so as to ultimately make
healing available to all

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
who could benefit.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:10%
