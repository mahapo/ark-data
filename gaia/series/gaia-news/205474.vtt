>> For centuries, humans
have tried to determine,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.130 align:middle line:10%
what is consciousness?

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.250 align:middle line:84%
How are we able to think
and have free will?

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.160 align:middle line:84%
A new scientific theory
says consciousness

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:90%
may be electromagnetic.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Philosophers and scientists
have debated the nature

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness for years.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness, put simply,
can be defined as "capable of,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:10%
or marked by, thought, will,
design, or perception."

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But where does this
ability come from--

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
inside the brain or
some external force?

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Johnjoe McFadden, Professor
of Molecular Genetics

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Surrey, has a new theory.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
He calls this the Conscious
Electromagnetic Information,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
or CEMI, Field Theory.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Professor McFadden explains.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The CEMI Field Theory is
simply that consciousness,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:10%
the physicality
of consciousness,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:10%
is actually the brain's
electromagnetic field.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic fields
unify all of the information

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the most important
feature of consciousness.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:90%
It's our unified thoughts.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And accounting for that the
binding problem has always

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
been the biggest problem
of consciousness,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
the CEMI Field Theory solves
it with a physical structure

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:90%
that we know is in our brain.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> His theory states
electromagnetic energy runs

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
through our brains like
radio wave signals.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, every time
a neuron fires,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:84%
it sends a little pulse
of electromagnetic energy

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:90%
into the surrounding space.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
The physical entity
that you detect with EEG

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is the pooled
electromagnetic field

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
created by the firing of
a hundred billion neurons

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
All the other theories
of consciousness

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
have always assumed that it's
the matter of your brain.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a
really big problem

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
with how is it all bound
together to make our thoughts.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That happens automatically
when neurons fire information

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:90%
into the electromagnetic field.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like radio signals
and analog TVs and radios.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the information that
travels through the airwaves.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%
It's unified.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
You can pick it up at
any point in space,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's got all
of the information

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:90%
for movies, for radio shows.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
All of that is there.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.905 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
that's what our brain is.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a transmitter
of its thoughts

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:90%
into the electromagnetic field.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the receiver
for those thoughts.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And going through that
circle of being transmitted

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
into the electromagnetic field
and then picked up by the brain

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:90%
is what our thoughts are.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The classical theories
of consciousness have been

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
characterized as
something intangible.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Professor McFadden says
his theory can actually

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.481 align:middle line:90%
be tested in a lab.

00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So we know that
electromagnetic fields--

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
external
electromagnetic fields--

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:90%
influence the way we think.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Even without the
external stuff--

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the helmet on your head,
or anyone else firing

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic
fields at the brain--

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
it's making its own
electromagnetic fields,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and that is influencing
how it works.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So that-- we have
already demonstrated

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
what we need to demonstrate--
is its functional significance,

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that that is
particularly associated

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.295 align:middle line:90%
with the conscious stuff.

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
circumstantial evidence

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that
that's the case.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But it does need more
experimental data as well.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> This could be more than
just an interesting theory.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
If proven correct,
Professor McFadden

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
says there are real world,
practical applications

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
for this study on consciousness.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We know, for example, that
how physicians try to identify

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
whether patients in coma
are still active mentally is

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
actually looking at the
brain's electromagnetic fields

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
by techniques such
as EEG and MEG.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at the
dynamics of their activity,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
they predict whether a
patient is thinking or not.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So we use that
information already.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
It's just not translated into
the language of the CEMI Field

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Theory in saying that the
reason why that's so useful--

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
looking at these
electromagnetic fields

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to assess the level
of consciousness--

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
is because those electromagnetic
fields are consciousness.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's all
being used already.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
change our thinking

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we're not just
a measure of consciousness--

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
field dynamics

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.425 align:middle line:84%
in the brain-- they
are consciousness.

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this controversial
theory put to rest the debate

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
over the nature
of consciousness?

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Does the electric
field generated

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
by our brain's neurons
result in our ability

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:90%
to think and have free will?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Professor McFadden hopes
to have laboratory test

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
results on his theory
within the next two years.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:10%
