00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Water has been confirmed
on the sunny side of the moon.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the
first real step

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:90%
in human colonization of space?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Or could this discovery probe
an even bigger understanding

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.570 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.775 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
NASA has known of
the existence of ice

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:84%
in permanently cold,
shady craters of the moon.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But for the first
time, the Space Agency

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
has confirmed water in sunlit
areas of the lunar surface.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:10%
H2O molecules were detected
in the Clavius crater

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:10%
on the moon's
southern hemisphere.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Using a modified plane with
a high-powered telescope,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
NASA detected the
specific wavelength

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.550 align:middle line:84%
unique to water molecules with
a relatively large concentration

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:90%
in the sunny Clavius crater.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:90%
But don't pack your bags yet.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:10%
The concentration of water is
100 to 412 parts per million.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:10%
That's about a 12-ounce
bottle of water

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:10%
per cubic meter of soil.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Compare that to
the Sahara Desert,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
which has about 100 times that
amount of water in the Earth.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
With such a small
amount of water,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:90%
what does this discovery mean?

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:10%
NASA's Casey Honniball
said in a statement,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:10%
"Without a thick atmosphere,
water on the sunlit lunar

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
surface should just
be lost to space.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:10%
Yet somehow we're seeing it.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.370 align:middle line:10%
Something is
generating the water,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:10%
and something must be
trapping it there."

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
NASA is investigating
theories as to how

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%
the water got on the moon.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But for the host
of "Initiation,"

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
MatÃ­as De Stefano, who has
researched ancient records

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, the evidence of water
on the surface of the moon

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
connects with a much deeper
understanding of where life

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
on Earth might have come from.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:10%
>> During the formation
of our solar system,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:10%
there were a lot of
planets and planetoids,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:10%
which are like dead planets,
very small and no straight

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:10%
orbit.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So this was during
the organization

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
And the moon was just moving
around in between the planets,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and that was something
that helped the moon

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:90%
to receive many comets.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Comets are basically
the ones that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
bring water, ice to
different planets.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So the moon was able to catch
many of them during its travels

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
through the solar system.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And it started to crush,
to break, and, of course,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
it loses a lot of
its mass and weight

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
when it crashed with
the Earth, bringing

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
all this material of
the comets that she

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:90%
brought towards our world.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If this ancient
history is correct,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
what can we learn from
this discovery and this new

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
perspective to understand
the universe we live in?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The main things that
will help us to understand

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:10%
because of this discovery is
that water is one only element

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:10%
of life throughout
all the cosmos.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.305 align:middle line:90%
And it's not only here.

00:03:10.305 --> 00:03:11.105 align:middle line:90%
It is everywhere.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It is in many
worlds, many planets.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And this also explains
that every planet

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
is in some way
connected through water.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And life is not
only what we know

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
being like this in this
shape, but life is basically

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:90%
water changing its shapes.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I guess this will open a
portal to understand that life,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:90%
it goes all through the cosmos.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Will NASA find more
evidence of our ancient past

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or a reliable source
for a new space base?

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Could this just be the beginning
of discovering more water

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:90%
on seemingly dead planets?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for certain--

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
this big discovery has humans
questioning their place

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
