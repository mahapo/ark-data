Dr. Ed Park, author of
"The Telomere Miracle,"

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:10%
explains how telomeres, aging
and stem cells could possibly

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
be affected by
oxygen treatments.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time a cell divides,
telomeres have to shorten.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And stem cells are
the kinds of cells

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:10%
that have an enzyme
that can relate to them,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:10%
making them kind of immortal.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.208 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're
getting older,

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
they're getting older at a much
slower rate than the non STEM

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
What we do see, is an incidental
shortening of the telomeres,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and that reflects where they
came from, because their stem

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:90%
cells are getting older.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:10%
So if we can have something
like breathing hyperbaric oxygen

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.440 align:middle line:10%
and it shows up in the
blood cells at least,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:10%
the inference, the
hope, is that it

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:10%
would show up in other cells.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>> A recent study out of Tel
Aviv University and published

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
in the journal, "Aging,"
claims promising results using

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
hyperbaric oxygen treatments to
lengthen telomeres and reduce

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
the accumulation of old
and malfunctioning cells

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in the blood of test subjects.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
In the study, 35 healthy
adults aged 64 and older

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
received 60 daily
hyperbaric oxygen treatments

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
over three months.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
The hyperbaric oxygen
treatment sessions

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
included breathing 100%
oxygen by mask for 90 minutes,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
with five-minute air
breaks every 20 minutes.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Blood samples from
the test subjects

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
showed an increase in
telomere length and a decrease

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:90%
in senescent cells.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Park weighs
in on this study.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at their study,
they look at two factors,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
which are telomere
length and senescence.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:10%
What they showed was a
very impressive drop-off

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:10%
in senescent cells, which
is old or damaged cells,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:10%
and an increase in
the telomere length.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
also, was at 30 days,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
it was significant,
and at 60, even more.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.445 align:middle line:10%
Specifically, we'd
like to know perhaps

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:10%
if they could look at
the epigenetic markers

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:10%
where the gene is silenced.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we could
look at other organs

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
where the telomeres in
other organs improved.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> What is hyperbaric oxygen
treatment as it relates to this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:90%
study?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The oxygen we breathe from
the Earth's atmosphere is about

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:10%
21%, mostly nitrogen. So
they can crank it up to 100%

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:10%
dissolved oxygen at higher
than 1 atmospheric pressure.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:10%
But if this study can
be repeated, it's valid,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:10%
it suggests a
decrease in old cells.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How could this and other
studies about telomere length

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
help us fight
diseases like cancer?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> When your telomeres shorten,
the next time a cell divides,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
they don't separate properly,
which can lead to any number

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:90%
of infinite mutations.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So you don't ever want those
telomeres to get that short.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of cancer,
you have a lot of mutations,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and yet somehow, the
surveillance and the suicide

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%
mechanism is disabled.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.898 align:middle line:84%
So in the future, they'll
be able to say, oh, OK, you

00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:90%
have this type of cancer.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's missing these genes,
for whatever the period is.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We'll introduce the
MRNA for those genes

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and your cancer will be
able to execute itself.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where I wish people

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
would go with the science.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What does the future hold
for studies like this regarding

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:84%
telomere length, aging
slower, and living healthier?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming down the pike
hopefully, supplements,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
certain senolytics hopefully
to kill off dead cells.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:10%
Maybe hyperbaric oxygen
could be a thing.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of these
bespoke or custom MRNA

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.440 align:middle line:84%
packages, not just for one
spike protein on one virus,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
but we can have proteins to be
packaged in exosomes message

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
RNAs to help with
nerve regeneration

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.857 align:middle line:90%
and other chronic illnesses.

00:04:11.857 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's really an exciting time.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> More study is needed,
but this may be another step

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in the battle against
aging and disease.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
What if something like
concentrated oxygen

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:84%
could be the answer to
preventing and curing disease

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.920 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll be watching the science
and keeping an open mind.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:10%
