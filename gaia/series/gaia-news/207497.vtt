>> A cutting edge new
study by Dr. Joe Dispenza,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.780 align:middle line:10%
the connection
between meditation

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.690 align:middle line:10%
and our body's capacity
to heal itself.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Our nervous system tends
to be the greatest pharmacy

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.190 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe Dispenza
has spent a career,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
as he puts it,
demystifying the mystical.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
To that end, after leading
week-long meditation retreats

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:84%
for years, he noticed miraculous
changes among the participants,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
with some even claiming to have
longstanding afflictions cured,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:90%
seemingly by meditation alone.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to put that
claim to scientific testing

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and partnered with the
University of California San

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Diego biology department.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:10%
They tested advanced
meditators, novice meditators,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
and a control group, and the
results have been fascinating.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Joe Dispenza on the results.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We started looking
closely at cellular function,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:10%
and we started measuring
thousands of cellular

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
metabolites that determine
whether a cell is in growth

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:10%
and repair or a cell
is in breakdown.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
At the end of seven days, I got
a call from our senior research

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:10%
analyst, and he says we have
some really compelling things

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.610 align:middle line:10%
to show you.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And we saw dramatic
changes in the biology

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:90%
of advanced meditators.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So when we started looking
at the cellular function,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
we noticed, along with the
change in the cellular function

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
for those people
that watch "Rewired,"

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
there was this arousal
that was taking place

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
in the person's brain and
in the nervous system.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the arousal wasn't pain
and the arousal wasn't fear

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and the arousal wasn't
anger or aggression, which

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
typically causes an arousal from
the sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The person was
reporting an arousal,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and the only word they could
use was ecstasy or bliss.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
They had made some
connection with something.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:10%
So when we captured the
blood of these people

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:10%
and when they made some
type of connection,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:10%
we noticed some really,
really powerful effects

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:10%
in their blood plasma.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But when they took the blood
samples of these meditators

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
into the lab, they were
in for a big surprise.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:10%
>> We created a pseudovirus,
and we put that virus

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of the blood of
advanced meditators and looked

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:10%
at it under an
electron microscope,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:10%
and we saw a resistance.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the virus
could not enter the cell.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:10%
And when we looked
at novice meditators,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.410 align:middle line:10%
we saw some of the
virus inside the cell

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.672 align:middle line:10%
and some of the virus
outside of the cell.

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:10%
And when we looked
at the controls,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.950 align:middle line:10%
all the controls were infected.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> On a cellular level, how
could blood from advanced

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.888 align:middle line:84%
meditators appear to
fight off disease?

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so we knew that there
was something in the blood

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:10%
of advanced meditators that
caused this kind of immunity.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So we went through
several different assays

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and biological tests
to actually isolate

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
a protein, a very
specific protein

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that has profound effects
on the immune system.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:10%
In fact, when we
take that protein

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:10%
and we put it in the infected
blood of the controls,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:10%
we noticed that all of the
infection in the controls

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:10%
was reversed.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:10%
In other words, it
reversed the infection.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And so we've isolated
this protein.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How do these advanced
meditators create this

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
disease-fighting protein?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:10%
>> And the person who's having
that inward experience is not

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:10%
having that experience from
anything in their environment.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:10%
Their eyes are closed.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.997 align:middle line:10%
There's music playing
in the background.

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:10%
They're not eating.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:10%
They're not smelling.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:10%
They're not tasting.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:10%
They're not moving around
and experiencing and feeling.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They're disconnected from
their outer environment.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, when
they connect, there's

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
some type of order
that's taking place

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
in their nervous system
that causes a frequency.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency in
their nervous system

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
must be carrying information
that transcends their senses.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one place
where we can name that,

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:90%
and that's the quantum field.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.190 align:middle line:10%
And so somehow,
there is some type

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:10%
of connection
between the biology

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:10%
of the brain and the body
and the physics of the field.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:10%
And somehow, we're
demystifying that process.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe Dispenza has
studied this subject for years.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
What does he hope this
discovery will bring people

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.670 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Nothing changes in
our life until we change.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:10%
And giving people the
formula on how to do that,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:10%
it no longer becomes
about healing.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It really becomes about what
stands in the way between you

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and becoming healed.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we're
demystifying that process

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and turning it into a
solid practical application

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
so that people have
within their reach

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
all the tools to make measurable
changes in their life.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time in history
where it's not enough to know.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:10%
This is a time in
history to know how.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:10%
>> On Friday, January 14 at
10:30 Eastern US time, Dr.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:10%
Joe Dispenza and his scientific
team are holding a live stream

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:10%
event open to the public to
provide all the data behind

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:10%
this discovery and what they
say is the future of health

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:10%
and healing.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:10%
