the rise and has become one

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.560 align:middle line:10%
of the more alarming
public health issues.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But what if, by using a holistic
approach to treating this

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
disease, there was a way
to prevent and even reverse

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:90%
the onset of Alzheimer's?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So there's a background.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:84%
All of this new work,
this new exciting work,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is because we have a foundation

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have studied the
disease for over a century.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And while they've come to
understand the mechanisms that

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
lead to Alzheimer's,
there haven't

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
been significant breakthroughs
in finding a viable treatment

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
to prevent patients' decline
into dementia and death.

Program in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rusk is one of
many doctors who

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
now ascribes to the protocols
of Dr. Dale Bredesen, which

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
show that a personalized
holistic approach

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
to Alzheimer's can not
only prevent the disease

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
but even reverse its
onset in early phases.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
But when she began
her work, they

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:84%
were looking for
one single cure.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I started in this
field in the '80s looking

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.267 align:middle line:10%
at single-targeted strategies
for dementia thinking that

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:10%
there would be a silver bullet
because that's the way we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:10%
thought-- receptor's specificity
working particularly with

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:10%
a targeted approach
to one brain chemical.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:10%
For example, acetylcholine
would be the answer.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:10%
It turns out it
isn't the answer.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:90%
So there's a background.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
All of this new work,
this new exciting work

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
in the area of dementia, is
because we have a foundation

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:90%
of what doesn't work.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
If you spoke to any neurologist,
any neuropsychologist,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
any physician,
they would say, no,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
we don't really
have anything that's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:84%
disease modifying for
Alzheimer's disease and nothing

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that slows progression
rates significantly.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
It certainly lends
credence to a new approach.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And the new approach
to me emerged in 2016

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
when I read a paper
by Dr. Bredesen.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In a proof of
concept trial, Dr.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Bredesen looked at 25
patients suffering from

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:10%
Alzheimer's disease and
evaluated their cognitive

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:10%
ability before and after they
followed protocols that focused

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:10%
on a number of lifestyle and
environmental factors believed

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.310 align:middle line:10%
to contribute to Alzheimer's.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of those root causes
are nutritional imbalances,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
difficulties with gut health,
toxins in food and air

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
and water--

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:84%
things like mold,
air pollution--

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
the effects of combined
prescription medication--

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:90%
polypharmacy, for example.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that there are external
mediated root factors too,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
root causes, and
modifiable contributors,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:90%
like how much we exercise.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I said that the food we
eat, but the nutrition

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
we derive from the
food we eat as well.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And remember that Alzheimer's
disease particularly

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
seeds itself very early.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So the amyloid and tau
begin to create problems up

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to 20-plus years prior to
the actual clinical symptoms

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:90%
of the disease.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly, Dr. Bredesen
found a large contributor

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to Alzheimer's was a
lack of neuroplasticity,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
or the brain's ability to
grow new neural pathways.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity has been found
to be boosted by activities

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that challenge the
brain, particularly

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
those that fall outside our
daily habits and routines.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Neuroplasticity
requires a challenge--

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
what I like to call a
disorienting dilemma

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
for the nervous system,
which means stress,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:90%
which means good stress.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Good stress provides
healthy neuroplastic change.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Bad stress provides negative
neuroplastic change.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to a lack
of activity supporting

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:84%
neuroplasticity, improper
sleep has also been found to be

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
a major factor in the onset of
Alzheimer's, so much so that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
some studies have found a
20% to 30% increased risk

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
in the development of
Alzheimer's and dementia

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
in patients who don't
get sufficient rest.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think sleep is one of the
most modifiable and important

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
contributors-- what
happens at night,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
what we take to sleep with
us, whether we're stressed,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:90%
whether we have sleep apnea.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we're losing
oxygen at night,

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
we're a little bit hypoxic,
a little low on oxygen.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
That can really affect
our brain health.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is a huge contributor
to cognitive decline

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:90%
and then to later dementia.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a recent
study has shown

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that sleep patterns in mid-life,
so earlier in life prior

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to people getting dementia,
contribute to later dementia

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
risk.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So basically if you're getting
less than six hours of sleep--

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's less than seven
hours of sleep in your 50s

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
or 60s-- it can contribute
to later cognitive

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
decline and dementia.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
You're 30% more likely to
get dementia later in life.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> As more research considers
this personalized multi-factor

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
approach that assesses
the various root causes

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
of dementia,
practitioners like Dr.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Rusk says she believes will
be able to drastically reduce

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the number of new Alzheimer's
sufferers, with Dr.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Bredesen going so far as to
say we may someday eliminate it

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%
altogether.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:10%
