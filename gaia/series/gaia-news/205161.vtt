>> The US Government UFO
Disclosure Report is due this

summer, but did a former
government intelligence

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.320 align:middle line:10%
official just reveal too much?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We're reading between the
lines and unpacking what

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%
his statements really meant.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.340 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
As we've previously reported,
the Intelligence Authorization

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:10%
Act for 2021 included
language calling

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:10%
on the director of National
Intelligence along with heads

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:10%
of other intelligence
agencies to submit a report

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:10%
and detailed analysis of all
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:10%
collected or held by
the US government.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:10%
That report is due
in June of this year.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:10%
But in a recent interview with
Fox News' Maria Bartiromo,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:10%
the former director of National
Intelligence, John Ratcliffe,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
had some interesting
comments regarding

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:10%
the report and UFO
activity including,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:10%
quote, when we talk
about sightings,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:10%
we are talking about objects
that have been seen by Navy

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:10%
or Air Force pilots, or have
been picked up by satellite

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:10%
imagery that frankly
engage in actions that

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.570 align:middle line:10%
are difficult to
explain, movements

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:10%
that are hard to replicate
that we don't have

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:10%
the technology for,
or traveling at speeds

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:10%
that exceed the sound
barrier without a sonic boom.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:90%
What's the takeaway here?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:90%
What did we really learn?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope, who worked for
the UK's Ministry of Defense

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:10%
investigating UFOs, weighs
in on the importance

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:10%
of Ratcliffe's statements.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I really think the impact
of this can't be overstated.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here, there
were a number of things.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It was fairly short,
the interview,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
but a number of different
related revelations in them,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
which to me was
the bombshell, was

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:84%
we track these things
on multiple sensors,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:90%
including satellite.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was just this
throwaway remark.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, you know, what?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one
sighting from a pilot here

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:90%
or a satellite there.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And you could say, if you
look at the Intelligence

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Authorization Act for 2021 where
this requirement was originally

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
articulated, it does say,
we want data from sources,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
including geospatial
intelligence.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So for people who are looking
closely, it was there,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
but this was absolutely
the first time that really

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:90%
for the public and the media.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.672 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, we tracked
these things on satellite.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What about his
statement regarding, quote,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
movements that are
hard to replicate?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And the implicit point here
was that it almost implies

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
a new physics or certainly a
new understanding of the laws

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And for him to specifically
mention, for example,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
traveling through
the sound barrier

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
but with no sonic boom, what
he's really saying there,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and I think with all these
statements with people

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
like this, you need to
read between the lines.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
As I say, what
he's really saying

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.060 align:middle line:84%
is that these things
behave in an unusual way,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
in ways that our own
technology doesn't behave in.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
When we accelerate an aircraft
through the sound barrier,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:90%
there was a sonic boom.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So he, Ratcliffe here, is
specifically pointing out

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
where these things don't
align with our understanding

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.955 align:middle line:84%
of things from
terrestrial craft.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> At one point in the
interview, Ratcliffe said,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
quote, I actually wanted
to get this information out

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and declassified
before I left office.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But we weren't
able to get it down

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:84%
into an unclassified format
that we could talk about

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.242 align:middle line:90%
quickly enough.

00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a huge admission
because, of course, for years,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
the US government position was
nobody's interested in UFOs,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
nobody in government is
researching and investigating.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
If there were
programs, they just

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:90%
had sightings from the public.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Mr. or Mrs. Smith seeing
some vague lights or shapes

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
in the sky and they turn
around and say, well, it's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
probably just aircraft
or weather balloons.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But to say, look, this
whole UFO phenomenon,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
we've got information
whether at pilot, satellites,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
UFOs behaving in ways that
our own technology does.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But not only if we
got this information,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
but we're struggling
to get it declassified.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:10%
>> When we see
interviews like this,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:10%
what should we watch out for?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>> When any of these
intelligence officials start

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:10%
talking about this, watch
for the examples they give.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Join the dots.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Look for those commonalities
in the language they use,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the words and phrases,
the examples, and then

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
see who else has used the
same or very similar ones.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can join the
dots between these people

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can kind of
sometimes figure out

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:90%
who's talking to who.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And if not, who's
been briefed by who,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
certainly who's had
the same briefing.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
That's not just interesting,
that's important.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:10%
>> In December of
2020, Haim Eshed,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:10%
the former head of the Israeli
Defense Ministry Space Division

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:10%
claimed that a galactic
federation had been in contact

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:10%
with the United States and
Israeli governments for years.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Adding, the Trump administration
was going to disclose it,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
but the aliens ask humans
not to reveal their presence

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
because the general
public was not ready.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this statement from a
former intelligence official,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.626 align:middle line:90%
what's the connection?

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an extremely
interesting and important

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
connection between Haim Eshed's
interviews and then the former

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
director of National
Intelligence for Trump says,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we wanted to get this out
but there wasn't time to get

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
this into an
unclassified format.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of the
same thing but wrapped up

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:90%
in different phraseology.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what I mean about
looking for the same thing said

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
by different people but where
you figure that they're either

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the same insiders who
know the same things,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
or they have been privy to
the same classified briefings.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of information was
revealed in this interview

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:90%
but there is more to learn.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Did this former director
of National Intelligence

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:90%
accidentally reveal too much?

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Or was this plan to prepare
us for bigger things to come?

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:90%
That remains to be seen.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The full report is due
in June but some experts

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
warn it could be
extended or delayed.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And still, we don't know
what will remain classified

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and what information will
be released to the public.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But we'll keep reading
between the lines

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and connecting the dots as we
continue to follow this story.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.318 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.118 align:middle line:90%
