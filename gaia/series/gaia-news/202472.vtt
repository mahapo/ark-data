00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> A significant development
in the field of psychedelics

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and the treatment of major
depressive disorder--

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.520 align:middle line:90%
this is "Gaia News."

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:10%
A recent study at Johns
Hopkins University published

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:10%
in the journal "JAMA
Psychiatry" has

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:10%
shown psilocybin,
the active ingredient

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:10%
in psychedelic mushrooms,
is successful at treating

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:10%
major depression
disorder, and has

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.990 align:middle line:10%
proven to be more effective
than traditional pharmaceutical

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:10%
therapies.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
In the trial, patients received
two doses of psilocybin

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
on different days, coupled
with about 11 hours

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:90%
of psychotherapy.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:10%
Alan Davis, author of the
study and an adjunct professor

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:10%
at Johns Hopkins, had this
to say about the results.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at both
groups after everyone received

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:10%
the treatment, 71% of the sample
had a clinically significant

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:10%
response at the
four week follow up.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:10%
And that response is
defined by at least

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:10%
or more than a 50% drop in
their depression scores,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
again rated by blinded
clinician raters.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And we also found
that 54% of the sample

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:10%
was classified as being in
remission from depression

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:10%
completely at the
four week follow up.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.226 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is the greater
significance of these findings?

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:10%
>> This is incredibly
significant.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Of course, there's
some 300 million people

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
who suffer from
depression worldwide.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:10%
There is about 16 million
people in the United States.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
This can be efficacious
in two or three sessions.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is disruptive
psychedelic technology.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a game changer.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
This is why, since they don't
have any other solution,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin for depression and
MDMA for post-traumatic stress

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:84%
disorder have been fast
tracked by the Food and Drug

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Administration as
breakthrough therapies which

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.089 align:middle line:84%
are showing improvements
that no other therapy can do.

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers have known
psilocybin has been effective

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
in the treatment of
depression in cancer patients.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:10%
But this study showed it
is effective in the larger

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:10%
population of patients with
drug resistant major depressive

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:10%
disorder.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
What could this finding mean
for the future of psychedelics

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
for treating other disorders
and for society as a whole?

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason why things are
changing today are similar

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:10%
to the process that's
happened with cannabis.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:10%
Legalization follows
medicalization.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Once people-- conservative,
progressive, Republican,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Democrat-- everyone
wants to be healthy.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And once people
understand that there

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
are medical and clinically
proven medical and scientific

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
benefits to
psychedelic substances,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
the attitude has shifted.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen
decriminalization movements

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
be effective in Denver,
in Oakland, in Santa Cruz.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And now we've seen the first
ever psilocybin services

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
initiative get approved by 55%
of the voters on November 3

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:90%
in the 2020 election.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it is not too
long in the future

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to see therapy
centers that have integrated

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic therapeutic
procedures into their work

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
with depression, fully
approved by the FDA

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.425 align:middle line:84%
and by the licensing
boards in their states.

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Although this
study shows promise,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.230 align:middle line:84%
don't self medicate to
cure your own depression.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:10%
"Limitless" host
Ben Stewart warns,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.275 align:middle line:10%
don't lose the mysticism when
it comes to this medicine.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope that we can open our
minds to the fact that these

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
medicines aren't scary.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not summoning demons
from these plant medicines.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
However, I hope we
never lose the sacred.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred is that,
let's never pretend

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
like we have these
things fully understood.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:10%
If we can find a reverence
for these things as sacred,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:10%
but also not mystify them in
a way that they are these,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:10%
again, called magic mushrooms.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
If we can get away from
the mysticism a little bit

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
but not go into a rigid,
formulaic way of looking

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.835 align:middle line:84%
at them, that's the kind of
future I hope we step into.

00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the mainstream
understanding of psychedelics

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
is growing, the understanding
of its purpose in society may be

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.680 align:middle line:90%
the next step.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:10%
