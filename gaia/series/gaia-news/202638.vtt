New technology

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.020 align:middle line:10%
is showing how algae could be an
answer to clean and inexpensive

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.730 align:middle line:10%
fuel in the future.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.190 align:middle line:10%
An American and French
collaboration so far

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.820 align:middle line:10%
shows it's possible using
wastewater as the catalyst.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE REPORTER: US company
OriginOil and French firm

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Ennesys have joined forces
to launch a unique energy

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:90%
generating project.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
They're producing algae from
wastewater in a high rise

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:10%
Paris office block, and turning
it into energy and clean water.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:10%
The wastewater comes from the
block's bathrooms, kitchens

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:10%
and toilets.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.730 align:middle line:10%
It's the medium in
which the algae is then

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:10%
grown in flat-paneled
bioreactors on the building's

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:10%
facade.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:10%
Ennesys CEO, Pierre
Tauzinat, says

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:10%
it may just be slime to
some, but to his company,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:10%
algae is the future of
clean, inexpensive fuel.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:10%
>>PIERRE TAUZINAT: Waste
water are full of nutrients,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:10%
and we prepare the
waste water in this way

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:10%
that phytoplankton microalgae
will nourish themselves

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:10%
from everything that is
inside this waste water.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
What you will have
is two things--

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
biomass made of the
phytoplankton that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
has grown in 24 to 48 hours.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.913 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand,
you will have pure water.

00:01:26.913 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE REPORTER:
From the biomass,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
fuel is extracted for
use in the building.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:84%
France's sustainable
energy law, the RT-2020,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:84%
requires all major buildings
to become more energy efficient

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:90%
by the end of the decade.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
OriginOil CEO, Riggs
Eckelberry, says

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the law has given the
project added momentum.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:10%
>>RIGGS ECKELBERRY: France has
a major thermal regulation that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:10%
is requiring builders to meet.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:10%
So builders
throughout France now

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:10%
have to show more
energy coming out

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:10%
of a building that
is going in, and they

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:10%
have to clean the sewage water.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:10%
These are big challenges.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:10%
Algae is a perfect solution
for both generating energy

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.942 align:middle line:10%
and cleaning up
the sewage water.

00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MALE REPORTER: The block,
based in Paris's business

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
district, Le Defense, contains
around 38 million square feet

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:90%
of office space.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:10%
The two partners believe that
integrating algae production

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:10%
into large building
complexes will help firms cut

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:10%
or even eliminate their
emissions, while also

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:10%
helping them save money and
water that would otherwise

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:10%
get poured down the drain.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.765 align:middle line:10%
>>FEMALE REPORTER:
Algae is still

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:10%
being studied as a possible
biofuel for large scale US

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:10%
transportation needs,
but the reality

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:10%
may not be so sustainable.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:10%
The US National
Research Council warns

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:10%
the process may use up more
energy, water, and nutrients

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:10%
than it creates.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Biofuels, made from
algae and cyanobacteria,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:84%
are possible alternatives
to petroleum-based fuels

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and be more cost
efficient for consumers.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:10%
However, to grow
enough currently

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:10%
takes a ton of water and
more energy to produce.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:10%
The USNRC says more research
and development is needed.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:90%
