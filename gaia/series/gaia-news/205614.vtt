may rewrite the history books

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.800 align:middle line:10%
on how and when North
America was first populated.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Historians and archaeologists
have tried for years

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question, how
did our ancient ancestors first

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.660 align:middle line:90%
populate North America?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
The most prevalent theory has
been the Bering Land Bridge,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that Ice Age migrants crossed
an ancient landmass from Siberia

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%
to North America.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But a new theory states
that Ice Age migrants

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
may have used a series of
islands, the Bering Transitory

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Archipelago, to
make the crossing

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and use these islands
as stepping stones

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
to get to North America.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Using a method called a
retrospective sea level

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
mapping, the scientists
found evidence

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of an archipelago
nearly 900 miles long

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that existed up to
30,000 years ago.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:10%
This theory could debunk the
nearly 100-year-old land bridge

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:10%
theory, change our understanding
of early human migration

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:10%
to North America, and shine a
light on maritime technologies

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:10%
they may have possessed.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:10%
Science and history writer
Andrew Collins on this theory.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The significance of this
latest theory is that we now

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:10%
have another means for people to
have traveled from the Eurasian

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:10%
continent into the American
continent at a very,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:10%
very early date.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We're talking as much as
20,000 to 30,000 years ago.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
What we're suggesting
now is that there

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
were a series of islands along
the edge of that Bering Land

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Strait, and that our earliest
ancestors were using these

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to island hop from Asia all
the way into North America.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the 1930s, the Bering
Land Bridge theory has been

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the most commonly accepted idea
explaining ancient migration

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
into North America, believed
to be about 13,000 years ago.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But in recent years, newly
discovered archaeological sites

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
have found evidence of
settlements thousands of years

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:90%
before this time.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Why hasn't this island hopping
theory been explored before?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the reasons why this
has not been properly looked

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
at before is because it
gives our ancestors maritime

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
capabilities, which a lot of
archaeologists are not happy

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:90%
to accept.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But I think that as we now know
that the Neanderthals, possibly

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
even Homo erectus, were
navigating across straits

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
as much as 50 to 60 miles in
different parts of the world

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
in the past, that
there's no reason why

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
our own modern human ancestors,
or indeed, those of hybrids,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:84%
like Denisovan or even
Neanderthal hybrids

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.585 align:middle line:84%
with modern humans
could not be achieved

00:02:55.585 --> 00:03:00.570 align:middle line:84%
in those same maritime
capabilities 30,000 years ago

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is probably a
little silly today.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> As new evidence is uncovered
that predates the existing

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
mainstream timeline of
history, why would it be

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
so controversial to re-examine
the data we've had for years?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why American
archaeologists cannot accept

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that people were in North
America prior to about 20,000

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
years ago is simply because it's
so far away from the so-called

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
pre-Clovis, or the
Clovis horizon,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
which is to date around
13,000 years ago,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%
that it's anathema to them.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you ask many
of these archaeologists,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and they will say that they've
discovered even older tools,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
going back to 30,000 years,
possibly even 50,000 years,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:90%
at these sites.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But they can't bring
them to the fore,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
because they would
be so controversial

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that these
archaeologists would lose

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
their positions at universities,
institutions, places like that.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So they'd rather just ignore
them for the time being

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate
on the tools found

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that are after
20,000 years ago down

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to the time of the Clovis
horizon, about 13,000 years

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So what does this all mean?

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:10%
As we gain a better
understanding of our human past

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:10%
and learn how we got here, what
can we learn from this theory?

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The big takeaway, I think,
from these latest ideas is that

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
it's pushing back the date that
modern humans first entered

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the American continent,
and I mean properly.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
There's been some archaeological
evidence from paleolithic sites

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to suggest activity going
back 20,000 years, possibly

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
even older than that.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
But now the archaeologists have
to sit up and take seriously

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the
Americas were peopled

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:84%
as early as 30,000 years
ago, and I would say

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:90%
as early as 50,000 years ago.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Looking at the
bigger picture,

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:10%
this theory is yet another
example that although some

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:10%
theories might
stand for some time,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:10%
when new evidence
comes to light,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:10%
we should follow that thread
without prejudice in search

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:10%
of the truth.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:10%
