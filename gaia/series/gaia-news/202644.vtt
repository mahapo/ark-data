00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.280 align:middle line:10%
>> The fields of neuroscience
and technology are emerging

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.750 align:middle line:10%
in amazing ways.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:10%
Researchers are finding ways
to use human thought to control

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:10%
everything from
smartphones to robots,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:10%
but there is also a dark side
to mind control technologies.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.620 align:middle line:10%
For more, we spoke with
journalist, Jon Rappoport.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:10%
He's written extensively
on the subject.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Jon, my first
question to you would

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:10%
be, how powerful is the mind?

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The potential is unlimited,
especially if you combine it

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:10%
with imagination or
the creative potential.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:10%
It isn't just about
thinking thoughts,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:10%
it's about inventing,
creating realities.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a reality
here, somebody made it.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We tend to accept that
this is all there is.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But realities are
created, and individuals

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
can create new realities through
imagination, through the mind,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.830 align:middle line:90%
through work.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, technology on the
forefront right now is that we

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:10%
would be able to interact with
computers through our brains

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:10%
itself moving cursors,
logging into our computers,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:10%
just thinking it.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> To the degree that it
actually works, why not?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.025 align:middle line:90%
Terrific.

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It gives people the
sense, my thoughts

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
are more powerful
than I believed.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That's a good thing if that's
all we're talking about.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the bad side?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the bad side is that
when other people begin to see

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
people in positions of
power, for example--

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
they say, well gee, we have
to control people's thoughts

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
because look at what thought can
do when hooked up to a machine.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:90%
This is an area of danger.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
We want to see what
people are thinking,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and we want to control
these thoughts.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get to
the dark side of this.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You've done a lot of
investigation on mind control

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
government experiments.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Why does it appear that, wow,
this is a great technology,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to do these
things, see thoughts perhaps?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:90%
What is really the bad part?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The bad part comes from
people who have bad intentions.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
They're always
looking to control.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's their game.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
They see somebody can do
something with a mind machine

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
hook up and they say, how
can we control that process?

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Not how can we liberate people
so that their thoughts manifest

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
new realities, but how can
we take over this whole area

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
and make it ours and control it?

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
That's not good.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure we're going to
be talking to you more

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:90%
about this topic in the future.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
