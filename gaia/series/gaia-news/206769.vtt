Shamanism is considered to be
the most ancient recorded form

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
of healing and
spiritual practice.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:84%
While science has been
studying the healing

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
benefits of the psychoactive
plants used by shamans to enter

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state
of consciousness,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
there have been very
few studies to look

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
at the neurological nature
of the state itself.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
A groundbreaking new
study investigated

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
this shamanic state
of consciousness

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
accessed without the
use of psychedelics.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Carlos Tanner is
a longtime student

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:10%
of traditional shamanism
and the director

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:10%
of the Ayahuasca Foundation,
an educational and ceremonial

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:10%
center in Peru.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Shamanism refers to
an alternate dimension,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:10%
a dimension where
spirits reside,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:10%
where communication is possible,
where greater insights can be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.470 align:middle line:10%
acquired and brought back
to the waking day life.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And so a shaman
would be someone that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
can enter into a
different dimension

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and then pull that back.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The process by which shamans
access this state is rooted

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
in the rich tradition of what
Carlos Tanner calls a science

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness enhancement.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Oftentimes, there is the
term ceremony to describe

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
the intentional entrance
into this shamanic state.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there would
be a preparation

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
where there might be rituals
to essentially prepare.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Certain clothing might be worn,
and the use of certain tools,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes like a musical
instrument, might be used.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.760 align:middle line:84%
All of those are this
really beautiful science

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
enhancement that I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
think has been developed
through the continual use

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:90%
of a psychotropic substance.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Although in many cases,
to the point where

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
the psychotropic substance
is no longer needed

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to enter that state, because the
consciousness enhancement that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
was provided by the
psychotropic substance

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:90%
can be accomplished without it.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Richard Harris is a
researcher at the University

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:10%
of Michigan who conducted the
recent study on the shamanic

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Harris and his team were
interested in investigating

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:84%
this state in its purest form,
uninfected neurologically

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
by the use of any
exogenous substances.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
To facilitate the entrance
into the altered state

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
without the use of
psychedelics, the practitioners

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
all listened to a recording
of shamanic drumming.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:10%
>> So we did a study with 24
shamanic practitioners and 24

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:10%
normal control individuals,
and we collected EEG data--

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:10%
Electroencephalograph
data, brain activity data--

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.440 align:middle line:10%
while each participant
was having their eyes

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:10%
closed, while they
were listening

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.963 align:middle line:10%
to classical music, which
was the control condition,

00:03:22.963 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:10%
and then while
they were listening

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:10%
to the shamanic drumming
music, which was the more

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:10%
experimental condition.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're doing
with the shamanic drumming,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
we're using the
person's own physiology

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:90%
to engender the state.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition, researchers
compared the brain scans

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
of the shamanic practitioners
in this study to scans

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
of participants on
psychedelics in other studies.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:10%
>> We found key differences
between entering the shamanic

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness and
altered states engendered

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:10%
by things like psilocybin,
and ketamine, and MDMA.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:10%
It's important to
know that, even

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:10%
though,
phenomenologically, there's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:10%
some similarities
in the experience,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:10%
like out-of-body
spiritual, blissful state,

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:10%
like some of those
experiences are the same.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:10%
But the underlying
neurobiology is different.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Specifically, the researchers
found increases in gamma

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
brainwave activity in
shamanic practitioners not

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
on psychedelics without the
typical decrease in alpha

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
brainwave activity seen
in those on psychedelics.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Just what are the implications
of these findings?

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That's kind of
what it's showing,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
is that that shamanic
state of consciousness,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you can get there
without taking a drug.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that's important
for the average person.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:10%
And that might give them more
insight into how they tick.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:10%
>> For Carlos Tanner, there is
an even greater implication.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the benefits
from this study is clear,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
that it helps us to
acknowledge, from our paradigm,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
from our materialist
perspective,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:90%
that shamanic states are real.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
They are verifiable,
scientifically proven to exist.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And where we're at, that's
a huge step forward.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to
see studies like this.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And the understanding
or the recognition

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:84%
that shamanic states and
altered states of consciousness

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
have the potential to provide
this benefit to us in our lives

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
is definitely the direction
I want to see us going.
