00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> A CIA UFO document
dump, nearly 3,000 pages

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:90%
of declassified material--

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:90%
but what will we learn?

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.340 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:10%
The CIA has released
almost 3,000 pages

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:10%
of documents from
their records on UFOs,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.370 align:middle line:10%
dating back to the 1980s.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
According to the agency, this
is everything the CIA has on

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:90%
UFOs dating back decades.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence agency
released the documents

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.810 align:middle line:84%
after John Greenewald
of TheBlackVault.com

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
filed multiple Freedom of
Information Act lawsuits

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:10%
But what new information can
we learn from all of this?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:10%
Futurist and
entrepreneur Paul Hynek,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:10%
son of famous ufologist
J. Allen Hynek,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.666 align:middle line:10%
has studied UFOs and
disclosure his whole life.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>> The last couple of
years, there's been a lot

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:10%
of interesting revelations and
disclosures and data dumps.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And it really forces us
to ask the main question.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Does the government have
smoking gun information-- alien

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
autopsies, reverse engineered
propulsion systems?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at all
sure that they do.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.060 align:middle line:84%
The next question,
then, is let's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
say that they do
have information

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that we feel is meaty, that
we can sink our teeth into.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:84%
We tend to simplify
things and say, hey,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:90%
the government's holding out.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
The government is comprised of
warring fiefdoms and factions

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:90%
that don't like each other.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
They're all warring, and they
have very different feelings

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
about what information
to reveal and not.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to imagine that,
A, they've got the smoking gun

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:90%
secrets.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And that, B, they will
act in a concerted effort

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to get all that
information to us

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:90%
in a ready-to-digest fashion.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Why release
these documents now?

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some confusion around
how much of this was a FOIA

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
request and how much was
prompted by the insertion

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of the language in the
stimulus bill last year.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:10%
Chris Mellon has a large
role in recent disclosures

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:10%
of government information.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that stimulus
bill, there's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
language that says
the government really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
needs to do deep
analysis and provide

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:84%
comprehensive information,
basically by July.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
This could be in keeping
with that first sort of wave

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
of information that
they'd released.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, we've seen an
increase in activity that seems

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
to be leading towards disclosure
from the government regarding

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:90%
UFOs and potential alien life.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
From the US Navy video
of UFOs, to the formation

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
of an Unidentified Aerial
Phenomenon Task Force,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and former government
officials claiming we

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.226 align:middle line:84%
are in contact with aliens,
is this part of a larger plan?

00:03:02.226 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>> The last couple years--

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and even more, I
think the cadence

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
has increased in the last year--
of information coming out.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You can make the
case that this is

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
part of the editorial schedule
of the government acclimating

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
us to a capital-D disclosure
that would be coming,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they can kind of
control the narrative landscape.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to have that
signal event of a flying saucer

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:10%
landing on the White
House lawn, and, you know,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Walter Cronkite
interviewing the occupants.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It may get to the point
where the population is ahead

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
of the government on what they
believe and what they know.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know that
the government, whatever

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
information they have,
really has that much ability

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to shape the narrative
going forward.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And Paul's biggest takeaway,
if not from this document dump,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%
from events of the past year.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Something I found interesting
last year when listening

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to ESPN, the two hosts
were talking about, hey,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:84%
if there is a Super Bowl
at the end of this season,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
will the winning team need to
have an asterisk by their name.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
And the other host, without
skipping a beat, said, look,

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you
need to know about 2020

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is that the Pentagon
admitted that UFOs are real.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
That was a really
interesting indication

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that the sort of
zeitgeist is changing.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
That not only are
beliefs evolving,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:84%
but that the ability
to talk comfortably

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
about this, on a
Disney-owned radio

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
station in the middle of a day
during a football discussion,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
was both appropriate
and interesting.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The Black Vault has
categorized and made

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:90%
the documents searchable.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
to find there hidden

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:90%
within the thousands of pages?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps they are just waiting
for independent investigators

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:10%
to connect the dots between
seemingly unrelated events.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Or could more documents and
evidence be coming soon?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:90%
