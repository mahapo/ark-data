>> Mars and Jupiter in
conjunction in Aries,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.350 align:middle line:10%
how you can take advantage of
the energy produced by this

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.920 align:middle line:10%
meeting of planets.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Mars and Jupiter uniting
an Aries is a boost of fire.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.325 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Gaia News.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:84%
On May 29, Mars and Jupiter
will be in conjunction

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
where they will appear
to be close to each other

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:90%
when observed from Earth.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they will both be in
Aries, something we have not

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:90%
seen since April of 2011.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:84%
What will the conjunction of
these strong planets in Aries

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:90%
mean to us?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer, Mercedes
Arnus Arraut.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:10%
>> To understand this
conjunction in a personal

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:10%
level, we need to understand
that Mars is our drive

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:10%
and Jupiter expands
everything that it touches.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:10%
And these two
planets are aligning

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:10%
in the constellation of Aries.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:10%
What is Aries?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:10%
Aries is the energy of birth.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:10%
It's the energy of beginnings.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:10%
It's the fire, where
the fire starts.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that gets us
going, that gets us moving.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
By Mars being in
Aries is the warrior

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:90%
entering in the battle field.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So we can be
feeling very feisty.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We can be feeling
a lot of energy,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
especially because
Jupiter is going

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
to highlight all that warrior,
all that warrior energy.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
So when Jupiter touches Mars,
all our fire is highlighted.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:90%
We feel a very strong drive.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
We feel like our
energy is on fire.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's very beautiful because
2022 has been a year, so far,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
that has been very sensitive.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.060 align:middle line:84%
We felt very emotional,
especially since the Jupiter,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Neptune conjunction.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, by Mars aligning
with Jupiter in Aries,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of
brand new beginnings.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the push that we needed to
leave behind all those waters,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
all those Piscean waters.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're heading
towards building a new life,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
creating a new life because we
have all that fire within us

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and all the cosmic
energy guiding us

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
towards starting something new.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> This conjunction in
Aries starts on May 29.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But we may start to feel
it sooner than that.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And how can we use the energy?

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to start
feeling this energy one week

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that to
prepare for this energy,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%
we calm ourselves down.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We try to have a little
compassion with others,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
but we use it to
go after what we've

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
wanted for such a long time but
we were a little shy to do it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:84%
or we lacked the confidence
or we lacked the strength.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So use it wisely to go
after your wildest dreams.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Use it wisely to do everything
that excites you in your life

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and that you didn't feel
confident enough to go after.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What can those of us who
are apprehensive about taking

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
the next step or for stepping
into the unknown do at this

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:90%
time?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I really suggest you take
advantage of this transit

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
to start a new life,
create a new project,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:90%
give birth to something new.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.942 align:middle line:84%
Do all these things that
you were afraid to do before

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
or those things
that you were like,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting for the right
time to do this, because this

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:90%
is the time to launch.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the time to use all
this fire, all this force, all

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
this strength to give an impulse
to whatever area in your life

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the conjunction
begins on May 29 and you may

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
feel it about a week before,
Mercedes says the energy will

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
last for about a month
after the conjunction.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So get your ducks
in a row and get

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
ready to take that cosmic leap
into your next phase of life.
