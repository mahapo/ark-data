>> A former CIA director reveals
he believes extraterrestrials

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.600 align:middle line:10%
could exist and shares
his incredible story.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.145 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:10%
Ambassador James Woolsey,
the former CIA director

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
under President Bill
Clinton, recently

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:10%
appeared on "Inside the Black
Vault" with John Greenewald

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:10%
to promote his new book,
"Operation Dragon,"

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:10%
about the JFK assassination.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
But when the conversation
turned to UFOs and secrecy,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%
he had this to say.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>> There has been over the
years now events of one kind

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:10%
or another, usually involving
some kind of aircraft-like

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:10%
airframe.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:10%
There was one case in
which a friend of mine

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:10%
was able to have his
aircraft stop at 40,000 feet

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:10%
or so and not continue
operating as a normal aircraft.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody know?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:90%
We'll have to look into it.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When asked to clarify,
Ambassador Woolsey continued.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I talked to someone whom I
respect who says that there was

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:10%
some event in which an
aircraft was paused.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:10%
And basically, that's
all I know about that.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:10%


00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:10%
>> "The Black Vault's"
John Greenewald has studied

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:10%
and revealed government secrets,
including UFOs, for 25 years.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
This was his first interview
with the former director

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:90%
of Central Intelligence.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to "Gaia News"
about his revealing interview

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.317 align:middle line:90%
with Ambassador Woolsey.

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So it's not every day for
me where I get to reach out

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:10%
to former government
officials and those members

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:10%
of the government,
either current or former,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:10%
to do an interview.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:10%
Ambassador Woolsey
was the first one

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:10%
that I would say
is at that level.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:10%
I've done television
work for many years

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:10%
and got to interview quite
a few different people.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:10%
But for my own show, this was
a once-in-a-lifetime very first

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
opportunity.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:10%
When he set up the fact that
there was disinformation

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:10%
about UFOs, again, to
be honest, in my head,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:10%
as the one interviewing
him, I thought, OK, this

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:10%
is where he's just going
to say it's all bunk.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:10%
The conspiracies are created
for disinformation purposes,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:10%
whatever purpose that
may be, and essentially

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:10%
dismiss the entire topic.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:10%
So he prefaces his
answer with that,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:10%
but then segues into but I
have this friend of mine,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:10%
a pilot, who was flying at
40,000 feet, that essentially

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:10%
had his plane pause in midair.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:10%
And he had his hand up in my
video frame and made the--

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:10%
made the hand gesture that
this thing stopped in midair.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:90%
He threw me off.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea that was coming.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, former intelligence
officers around the world have

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
hinted at or said outright that
we have more information about

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.150 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Haim Eshed, former head of
Israel's Defense Ministry,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:10%
said we are in contact with
the Galactic Federation.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:10%
Former CIA chief John
Brennan said, quote,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:10%
"it's a bit presumptuous
and arrogant for us

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:10%
to believe that there's no
other form of life anywhere

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:10%
in the entire universe."

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:10%
And former director of National
Intelligence, John Ratcliffe,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:10%
said we have seen aircraft,
quote, "traveling at speeds

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:10%
that exceed the sound barrier
without a sonic boom."

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
With that in mind, the
ambassador was asked--

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So can I add your name to the
list of those that are speaking

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:90%
out about this?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
What are your overall
thoughts about whatever

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:90%
that phenomena is?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
And what are we dealing with?

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:10%
>> The only list I'm comfortable
going on is one that would say

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:10%
these people have reported very
curious behavior by aircraft.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:10%
And it may be
something real that

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:10%
is an extraordinary change
for some unheralded reason.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:10%
I just don't know.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:10%
But I'm not as skeptical
as I was a few years ago,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:10%
to put it mildly.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I have been in conversations
with several individuals who

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
have been close to an
aircraft performing

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
in an extraordinary fashion.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
That's about as far
as I'd like to go--

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> --which is openness
to new things,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
willingness to examine them,
hope that we can be friendly

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
in terms of dealing with our
fellow human beings or with

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:90%
other creatures if they exist.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Some new possibilities
are frauds.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't think this one is.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But over history, there
have been a lot of frauds.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And we could have another one.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming from a former head of
the CIA, that is saying a lot.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
What was most significant?

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:10%
>> So these pieces of
information that he has seen,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:10%
maybe more of these news
articles and news pieces that

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:10%
are more of a serious tone, has
convinced a former DCI, hey,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:10%
this UFO UAP thing, it's not
something to be laughed at.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And so when ambassador
Woolsey then

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:10%
had talked about being friendly
with either other humans

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:10%
or, in his words, what he said
creatures, should they exist,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:10%
that was another
moment of the interview

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:10%
that my jaw just went down.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:10%
I had to push it
back up a little bit,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:10%
simply because former DCI is
talking about the possibility

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.080 align:middle line:10%
of alien life.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.450 align:middle line:10%
And as crazy as
that might sound,

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:10%
he was very genuine
with what he was saying,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:10%
that we shouldn't just
start blowing things up

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:10%
because we don't know
who or what these pilots

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:10%
or whatever this phenomena
is, the root of it

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:10%
all, that we just
start shooting at it,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:10%
that essentially he's saying he
hopes that we can be friendly.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet another former
intelligence official

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
commenting on the possible
existence of extraterrestrial

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Are we moving towards
full disclosure?

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We could learn more
in the coming months,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
as we're looking forward to
the government UAP report.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, in the
words of Ambassador Woolsey,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
we must be open to new
things, have the willingness

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to examine them, and hope that
we can be friendly to whatever

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:90%
we may find in the universe.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:90%
