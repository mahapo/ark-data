>> The US military confirms
the first interstellar object

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.510 align:middle line:84%
to hit Earth was years before
Oumuamua and corroborates

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.020 align:middle line:84%
research done by a
famous astronomer.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.185 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:10%
We have reported
before about Oumuamua,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:10%
the first interstellar object to
enter our solar system in 2017.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
And Harvard Professor Avi Loeb's
book arguing that Oumuamua

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:10%
might be extraterrestrial.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, its
existence was remarkable

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as the first interstellar object
to enter our solar system.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, we are
learning Oumuamua

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:84%
was the second
interstellar object

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:90%
to enter our solar system.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And this discovery was made
by none other than Avi Loeb.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:10%
In 2019, Professor Loeb, working
with his student, Amir Siraj,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:10%
combed through the
database of meteors looking

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:10%
for other interstellar objects.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
When they found evidence of
a fast moving meteor that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
hit the Earth,
they wrote a paper,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
arguing it was interstellar
too, and precedes Oumuamua

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.085 align:middle line:90%
by almost four years.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:10%
Harvard Professor
Avi Loeb explains.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:10%
>> The referees of the
paper that we wrote rejected

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:10%
the paper, argued that it
should not be published,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.560 align:middle line:10%
because they don't trust
the government and perhaps

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:10%
the uncertainties, which
are often quantified

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:10%
in the scientific
literature as error bars,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:10%
which they are just the level of
uncertainty in the measurements

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:10%
are unknown.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So, the paper could not
go through peer review or be

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
published because although
they used a public government

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
database, the level of
uncertainty or error bars were

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:90%
kept classified.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The US military does not
reveal that information,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
as it could give away the
sensitivity of their equipment.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
The paper was stuck in
academic limbo, until now.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The US Space Command
just released

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
a memo sent to
NASA's Science Chief

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
confirming Avi Loeb
and Amir Siraj's work.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Sharing in a tweet that
they, quote, "confirm

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that a previously-detected
interstellar object was indeed

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:90%
an interstellar object."

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Besides proving Avi Loeb
right, that the meteor in 2014

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:84%
was interstellar, what is the
significance of this event?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:10%
>> First of all, the government
helps progress of science,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:10%
which is quite a
watershed moment in a way,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:10%
because this was classified
information they're willing

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.735 align:middle line:10%
to release part of it.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:10%
They are not giving us
the full measurements,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:10%
but they are saying
at the 99.999%

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:10%
that we were right in our
2019 paper with my student.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
The second point is, this is
actually the first interstellar

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
object to have been detected
because it predates Oumuamua

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:90%
by almost four years.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Oumuamua was
about 100 meters in size,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and we discovered it
with telescopes because

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:90%
of the reflection of sunlight.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
In the case of a meteor,
you see the fireball

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
generated as it drops against
the atmosphere and burns up.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.007 align:middle line:10%
And so, you can
see smaller objects

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:10%
because you are not relying
on reflection of light

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:10%
from the sun.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So, what's next?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Can we find this
object on Earth?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Any meteor is
disintegrating into fragments.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can go off the
coast of Papua New Guinea where

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
this meteor landed and look for
the fragments from this meteor

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:90%
and study it.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a very
expensive expedition.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Much less than the billion
dollar space mission

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
needed to land on an
object like Oumuamua,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
the first interstellar
object reported.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So, it offers a
completely new way

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that is not so
expensive at learning

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
about the composition of the
material that made the object,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
about perhaps
whether it's natural

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:90%
or artificial in origin.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We can put our hands on
whatever is left from it

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to laboratories
at a relatively modest cost.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What does this whole
series of events show us about

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:84%
the future of science
and space exploration?

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Science is supposed
to be guided by evidence,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
not by prejudice, and not by
the number of likes on Twitter.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Altogether, I think it's
a celebration of science

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that
the government is

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:10%
willing to declassify
some information that

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:10%
is of national
security importance.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And second, that we
found a new avenue

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
for exploring the
nature of objects

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
the size of a meter that came
from outside the solar system.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:10%
It's very likely that in terms
of artificial objects produced

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:10%
by extraterrestrial
technological civilizations,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:10%
there are many more small
objects than big objects.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Loeb
and Amir Siraj argue,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
studying interstellar
meteors could provide proof

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial life.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Saying in their paper,
that meteors could, quote,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
"deliver life from
another planetary system."

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:10%
