>> The mystery
signal from space--

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.930 align:middle line:10%
what was actually broadcast
from Proxima Centauri?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.505 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:84%
December 2020, news breaks
of a mysterious signal

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
coming from the area
of Proxima Centauri.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Ufologists and astronomers
were excited by the news

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
as the planet Proxima B
may be able to host life.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The signal was originally
detected in the spring of 2019

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:84%
by the Breakthrough
Listen project

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
using the Parkes
telescope in Australia.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But the significance
of what they found

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:90%
was only recently made public.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
What was so intriguing
about this transmission?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia news
contributor Marc Dantonio.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The universe
is a noisy place.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
We hear the universe
all the time.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.375 align:middle line:10%
Radio telescopes
listen to the universe.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we're listening
in the radio world

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
and we hear stuff
in the universe,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:90%
usually it's a big wide patch.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.695 align:middle line:84%
We hear it through lots and lots
of frequencies, lots of stuff.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like noise.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:90%
You know, pshhh-- noise.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:90%
That's lots of frequencies.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
This is one frequency.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's 982.02 megahertz.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
That does really beg the
question what is this?

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Could it be real,
like a real phenomena

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
understand yet or could

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:84%
it actually have
been generated by

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:90%
a technological civilization?

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been some notable
false alarms in the past,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
even at the Parkes telescope
where this signal was detected.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Could that be what's going on?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a problem
that occurred at some point

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
in the past where they actually
thought they were getting

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.785 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial signal.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It turned out it was
actually the microwave

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:90%
in the kitchenette.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And that signal
transferred through

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the electrical circuitry to put
a signal into the stream coming

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:90%
from the telescope.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:90%
They fixed that since then.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:90%
So this one isn't a microwave.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
If the Proxima signal is any
indicator, and if the Proxima

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
signal stands up to
scrutiny, then, perhaps, this

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
means that we have seen a
true extraterrestrial signal

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
at 982.02 megahertz, a
very specific frequency.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't know any phenomena
that sound off like that.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
They usually sound off in a
huge range of these frequencies,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
like white noise,
a whole broad band

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff coming at you.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:90%
This is different.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
makes it so exciting.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> As a professional astronomer,
what is your best guess

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
as to what's causing
this phenomenon?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> When I'm asked to
guess what this signal is,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you right
now, I don't know.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
That is the most wonderful
thing that you can say--

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible that
we'll figure out what it is.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It's very possible that
we'll get an explanation.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
This here-- a very
specific frequency--

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
is very, well,
specifically strange.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do the
diligence to find out

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%
if it's a human signal or not.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you're
asking me to hazard a guess,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to say we don't know.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's the exciting part.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The signal
remains unexplained.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:10%
Could it just be an
interstellar interference

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:10%
or a message from a
technologically advanced

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial civilization?

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:10%
Researchers at the
Breakthrough Listen project

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:10%
are working to figure
out just what it was.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
They're expecting to
publish results this year.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But as one team member told
the "New York Times," quote,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.210 align:middle line:84%
"This is extremely exciting, no
matter what comes out of it."

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
