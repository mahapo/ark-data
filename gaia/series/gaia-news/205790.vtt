extraterrestrial life is

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.790 align:middle line:10%
getting a boost from scientists.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Could this grassroots,
transparent effort

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.560 align:middle line:84%
answer the biggest question

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
The quest to find evidence
of higher life forms

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is getting a boost
from higher education.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:10%
Harvard Professor
of Science Avi Loeb

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
has just launched The Galileo
Project, the goal of which

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:10%
is to bring the
search for, quote,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:10%
"Extraterrestrial
Technological Civilizations

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:10%
from accidental or
anecdotal observations

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:10%
and legends to the mainstream
of transparent, validated and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
systematic scientific research."

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:10%
Professor Loeb, who published
his controversial book

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:10%
"Extraterrestrial: The
First Sign of Intelligent

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:10%
Life," which claims Oumuamua,
the first known interstellar

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
object to pass through
the solar system,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:10%
could be an
extraterrestrial artifact.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:10%
His research, coupled
with the recent release

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.280 align:middle line:10%
of the US government's report on
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:10%
spurred him to action.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I decided that the
subject should move away from

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:10%
the talking points of
politicians and military

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:10%
personnel to the
realm of science.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
At around the same time, the
head of NASA, Bill Nelson,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
said, indeed, it's about
time for scientists

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:90%
to look into this.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
So I contacted people under him.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm here
to serve, and I can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:90%
help you make your boss happy.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't
gotten back to me.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And around the same time, a
few individuals approached me

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
with funds that they
provided to my research,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:90%
no strings attached.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I decided,
then, I can do it myself,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
including scientists only,
no government officials.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to place
a network of telescopes

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:90%
that would look at the sky.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:90%
The sky is not classified.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Only the government-owned
sensors are classified.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we can get
the high-quality data

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
by a network of instruments
that we control.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> His book on Oumuamua and
his hypothesis that it may have

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:84%
been an extraterrestrial
artifact was met with

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
skepticism by many in
the scientific community.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
What has been the reaction since
launching The Galileo Project?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What is exciting about this
project is that the day after

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
it was announced, I received
thousands of emails from people

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that are excited about
contributing to the project,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:84%
both scientifically
and financially.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And this illustrates
two points--

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
one, that the subject is of
great interest to the public,

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and young people will
be attracted to science

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
if we define it as
part of the mainstream.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
that new funds can

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:90%
be brought to pursue science.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:84%
On both counts, I see it
as a win-win proposition.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And we will learn
something new no matter

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
what, because even if Oumuamua
was a hydrogen iceberg,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
a natural object that
we've never seen before,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.870 align:middle line:84%
we will learn that there are
nurseries making such objects

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:90%
that we have never imagined.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And even if unidentified
aerial phenomena

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
are some exotic events
in the atmosphere,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
we will again learn something
new about our atmosphere

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't know before.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And in either case,
even if it's not

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial technology,
we will advance our knowledge.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And so getting
additional evidence

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is obviously a
win-win proposition.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The Galileo Project plans
to use off-the-shelf technology

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and, to remain transparent,
will not be funded by any

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.093 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no
government funding.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are not planning to use
classified data, because that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
would limit our freedom in
terms of making our data open

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
When you tell a kid
what the truth is,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
a kid often refuses
to believe that

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and tries to get the
information on his or her own.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And science allows us to
maintain our childhood

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
curiosity and basically
collect new data.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Science is about
reproducibility of results.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So we should be
able to see if there

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.090 align:middle line:90%
is anything unusual in our sky.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be the ultimate
find for the scientists

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
involved with The
Galileo Project?

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Unidentified objects
may have been a mixed bag.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe most of them have
some mundane explanations,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.700 align:middle line:90%
natural explanations.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But even if one belongs to an
extraterrestrial technological

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
civilization, that would have
a huge impact on society.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It will change the way we
view ourself in the universe.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
It will change our
relations with each other,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
because very often,
we are engaged

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
in actions that are
trying to demonstrate

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that we are superior
relative to other people.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And that would make
little sense if there

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is an advanced civilization
that is far more superior to us.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, it will change our
theological and philosophical

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
beliefs.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, there is
no bigger question

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in science than this one.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Are we the smartest kid
on our cosmic block?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:10%
>> To place hundreds
of independently-owned

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:10%
and controlled telescopes
around the world,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Avi Loeb says The Galileo
Project needs to raise about 10

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:10%
times the amount of
money they have received.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The project has just
begun, and they hope soon

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
to identify what or
who is in our sky.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:10%
