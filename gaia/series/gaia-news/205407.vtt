00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The highly anticipated
mission to Mars is off

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.080 align:middle line:10%
to an excellent start, with
a series of record-breaking

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.230 align:middle line:10%
firsts.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So what does this mean
for getting humans

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.190 align:middle line:90%
to the Red Planet?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.962 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.878 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
What began in
February 2021, with

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.750 align:middle line:84%
the suspense-filled landing
of the Perseverance Rover

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:84%
on the Red Planet is now
a mission in full swing.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Within the course
of just a few weeks,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
the 4-pound
helicopter, Ingenuity,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
the first powered aircraft
on a world beyond Earth,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:84%
successfully completed
three flights.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time ever
on an extraterrestrial planet,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
oxygen was created
from carbon dioxide.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
Robert Zubrin, former
aerospace engineer, author,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
and founder of the Mars
Society, talked to us

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:10%
about the significance
of these feats.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The MOXIE experiment is a
system that takes in Martian

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:10%
atmosphere, which is
95% carbon dioxide,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:10%
and splits it into carbon
monoxide and oxygen,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:10%
throws the carbon monoxide
away, but it keeps the oxygen.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:10%
And oxygen, of course,
everybody knows,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:10%
is essential for life support,
but it's also the majority

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:10%
of rocket propellant.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
If you were, for instance, to
use a SpaceX Starship, which

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:84%
runs on methane and oxygen, 75%
of that mixture is the oxygen.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're literally making rocket
propellant out of the air.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Another major milestone of
the mission is the successful

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
completion of three helicopter
flights, with more to come.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Ingenuity is the first
aircraft that has gone to Mars.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's the first
powered aircraft

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
that's gone to any planet.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
On Mars, it's very hard to fly.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Martian atmosphere is 1% as
thick as the Earth's atmosphere

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
at sea level.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
They went up, they
traveled 50 yards on Mars,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and they took photographs from
the air, for the first time.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:10%
They're going to take this on
ever more aggressive flights.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What makes this part of
the mission so significant?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The potential of
this is fantastic

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're rovers.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.130 align:middle line:10%
They can travel 200
yards in a day or so.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%
This little helicopter
could probably

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%
travel 200 yards in a minute.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Bigger helicopters,
which will follow,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
if this thing
continues to work well,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
we'll travel 200 miles in a day.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
They'll be able to use a
ground-penetrating radar

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
from the air to look
for underground,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:90%
water underground, caverns.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's so much more
you can do with an aircraft

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:10%
than you can with
a ground rover.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what does this mean
for the possibility of a human

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:90%
expedition to Mars?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Mobility is the key
to effective exploration.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And people like me, who've
designed human Mars missions,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
have designed it assuming that
the best mobility we would have

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:90%
would be ground cars.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But now, what if we can make
helicopters that astronauts

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:90%
can fly around on Mars?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%
They'll be as free as birds.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:10%
And they will be thousands
of times more effective

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:10%
as explorers than if they
were restricted to the ground.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:10%
>> What's next for this mission?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:10%
>> First of all, Ingenuity
is going to continue to fly

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:10%
and make more and more
aggressive flights.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The Perseverance Rover,
though, is powered

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
by a radioisotope generator.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:90%
It can travel for years.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it can be expected
to go at least a decade.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It has a microscope
that it can use

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
to examine minerals to
see if, in fact, they

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
might be microfossils
left behind by organisms.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
So it can do fossil hunting.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It's going to do
sample gathering.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
It has a variety of
other instruments on it.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For many like Robert Zubrin,
the real work of searching

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
for life on Mars will be
done when we get humans

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Human explorers on Mars have
a much better chance of finding

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
fossils on Mars.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Going beyond fossils,
finding extinct life on Mars,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
will require drilling because
if there's life on Mars today,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:90%
it's not at the surface.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:90%
The surface has no liquid water.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
We set up drills.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
We bring up some of the
samples of that water.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We see if there's
life, and we subject

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:90%
it to biochemical examination.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need to do to
discover the nature of life

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:90%
on Mars.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
This is something way beyond
the ability of robotic rovers.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have to send
human explorers to Mars.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:90%
If we don't go, we won't know.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In the meantime, the hope is
that this mission will get us

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:90%
one step closer.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:10%
