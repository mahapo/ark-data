00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>> NASA has just announced
they will launch their own

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.010 align:middle line:84%
independent study of UFOs,
a major change in policy

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:90%
for the agency.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Is this the next step
towards full disclosure?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a dramatic U-turn.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't overstate
the importance of this.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.855 align:middle line:90%
>> This is "Gaia News."

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
On the heels of the
first public UFO

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
hearing on Capitol Hill
in more than 50 years,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:84%
NASA has just
announced they will

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:84%
form their own
independent team to study

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:84%
UFOs, or UAPs, as the
government now calls them.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Writing in a release, NASA
says they will study, quote,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
"observations of events in the
sky that cannot be identified

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
as aircraft or known natural
phenomena from a scientific

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:90%
perspective."

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:10%
And Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's
Associate Administrator

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:10%
for Science, added, quote, "We
have the tools and team who

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
can help us improve our
understanding of the unknown.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the very definition
of what science is.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do."

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:10%
For context and
perspective, we turn

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:10%
to Nick Pope, who served at
the UK's Ministry of Defense

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:10%
covering UFOs.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:10%
How big is this news from NASA?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this NASA
announcement is groundbreaking.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:10%
I very much welcome it.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
I think it's long overdue.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very interesting.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You could read it
a number of ways.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:10%
Firstly, you could say that this
was just filling an obvious gap

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:10%
that the military and the
intelligence community

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:10%
are actively researching
and investigating

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:10%
as a result of
congressional interest.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:10%
And more than
interest, of course.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.020 align:middle line:10%
It's in the Defense
bill, so it's a mandate.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So you could just say that,
well, they want a science plan.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:84%
In all of this, NASA is
logically the place to do it.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.905 align:middle line:84%
But there's another way that
you could interpret that,

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and NASA doing their own inquiry
is arguably a sort of statement

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
that they don't perhaps
have confidence in the way

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
that the DoD and the
intelligence community

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
are moving ahead, and they
want to do it their own way

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and use their own
resources and capabilities.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a major break with
the past for the space agency,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
who has avoided any serious
discussion of the aerial

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:90%
phenomena for decades.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So why are they doing
this, and why now?

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a complete
180-degree turn.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
NASA previously
said, we are looking

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial life,
but it's a scientific search.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
We are not as part of
that looking at UFOs.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
We are not interested
in UFO sightings.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We have not investigated
and will not.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like,
oh, yeah, we'd

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:90%
better take a look at this.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So either they realize that
they've been missing a trick,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
or the doubters are correct
when they say, come on.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:90%
They were always in this game.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just now they've
got to be open about it.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But either way, this
is a dramatic U-turn.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't overstate
the importance of this,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were absolutely
adamant that they were not

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
going to touch this
subject, and now here they

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
are at the heart of it.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Pope has been involved
with UFO study for nearly 30

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
years, looking at
the bigger picture.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
What does this
announcement mean?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Could this lead
us to disclosure?

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> This is vindication.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
This announcement is really,
I think, a validation

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:84%
of what a lot of people
know, suspect, believe,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
depending on who they are
and what access they've had.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's another
piece of the puzzle.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think four or
five years ago, nobody

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
would have realistically thought
we'd be where we are now.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
revelation after revelation.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
The existence of the
Pentagon's AATIP program,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
the US Navy videos
and photos of these,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
classified briefings
in Congress,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:84%
a report from the Office
of the Director of National

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence, public hearings,
open hearings in Congress,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and probably more to come.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And now this NASA announcement.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.860 align:middle line:90%
All I can say is, my goodness.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The team will begin their
study this fall and should last

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:90%
about nine months.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:10%
