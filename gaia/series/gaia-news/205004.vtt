00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.920 align:middle line:10%
>> October 2017, an object
hurtled through our solar

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.410 align:middle line:10%
system at a blistering speed.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Many thought it was an
asteroid or a comet,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:84%
but one Harvard astronomer
argued it was extraterrestrial.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
October 19, 2017, the University
of Hawaii's observatory

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
picked up an oblong-shaped,
comet-like object.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
A quarter of a mile wide
and up to 10 times as long,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the object flew at
196,000 miles per hour.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:10%
At that speed, it was determined
to be the first object

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:10%
to come from outside
our solar system.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:90%
But what was it?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Named 'Oumuamua, a Hawaiian
word roughly translated

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
meaning scout, the object
was thought to be a comet.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:10%
Except, as Harvard professor
of science and chief astronomer

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:10%
Avi Loeb argued, 'Oumuamua
didn't show the characteristics

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:10%
of a comet.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
He argued it behaved
more like a light sail.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
A light sail uses the
pressure of sunlight

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:90%
to propel a spacecraft.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:10%
He believed this was not
an asteroid or a comet.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
'Oumuamua was either an
extraterrestrial probe

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of an
extraterrestrial probe.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:90%
This was met with controversy.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:10%
He spells out his reasoning
in detail in his new book

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:10%
"Extraterrestrial--

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:10%
The First Sign of Intelligent
Life Beyond Earth."

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:84%
What was the first clue that
'Oumuamua was not a comet?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The most striking evidence
at the time was the variation

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:10%
in the amount of light that
is reflected off the object,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:10%
implying a very
extreme geometry,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:10%
and also the fact that it's the
first object from outer space

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:10%
that we see near us that
doesn't show a cometary tail

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't behave similar
to the objects we have seen

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:10%
already.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And there was a report that this
object shows this excess push

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
away from the Sun, even
though it has no outgassing.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
We have to summarize all the
different properties that

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
make it unusual, so I did that
in a "Scientific American"

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:90%
article.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I wrote
a scientific paper

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
with a postdoc of
mine, Shmuel Bialy,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the light sail
as a possible explanation

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:90%
for all these problems.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't some objects in
space naturally behave this

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
way?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The suspicion that it might
be artificial is basically that

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:10%
it has properties that make it
different from everything that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:10%
we have seen before.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
The reason it looks
peculiar is because it

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
had a very extreme geometry--
at least 10 times longer than it

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:84%
was wide, most likely flat,
with a high reflectivity

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
at the high end of objects that
we see in space, and exhibiting

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
an extra push away from the
Sun without any outgassing,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
implying that perhaps
it's very thin

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and is being pushed by
reflecting sunlight.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And how did the scientific
community react to these ideas

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that 'Oumuamua was not
naturally occurring?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The scientific community
has a taboo on discussing

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
technological signatures
as possible explanations

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:90%
for anomalies.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
My point is lay out all the
possible interpretations,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and then we collect more
evidence, more clues,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and narrow down
the possibilities.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
The artificial
origin looks to me

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
as more appealing than
any of the proposals that

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:90%
were put on the table.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
In the case of space, most
of the objects we might find

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
could be billions of years old.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And one way to find
out is by monitoring

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
all the new objects that enter
the solar system from outside.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we fix the problems
Professor Loeb sees with

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:90%
scientific culture today?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>> The purpose of writing my
book was in part to change

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:10%
the current culture, to allow
discussions on topics that are

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:10%
tabooed right now, and benefit
from those discussions in terms

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:10%
of planning our own future.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We have an obligation to
answer these questions

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
within our lifetime, and it
would make science much more

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:90%
exciting.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And by writing the
book, my hope is

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that I will convince at least
one kid around the globe

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:90%
to become a scientist.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And if I do so, I
would be satisfied.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What question should the
next generation of scientists be

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:90%
asking?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest question
that we can ask is,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:90%
what is in our neighborhood?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone?

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And if not, how smart are
the other kids around us?

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:90%
And can we learn from them?

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We could also learn
from their mistakes.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
If we find dead civilizations
that destroy themselves,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
we can figure out why
and avoid a similar fate

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:90%
ourselves by behaving better.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So altogether I'm very hopeful
that the young generation

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
of today will find
evidence for our neighbors

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.575 align:middle line:84%
and bring us a better
future than our past.

00:05:21.575 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Professor Loeb believes
now that we know interstellar

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
objects do visit
our solar system,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
the next time we'll be ready
and could intercept them with

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
cameras and equipment that could
positively identify exactly

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:90%
what they are.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
As for the health and
science of academics,

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:84%
he is hopeful that
things will change.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And he hopes scientists
in the future

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
will take to heart
what he wrote in 2020--

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:84%
"When you are not ready to
find exceptional things,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.140 align:middle line:90%
you will never discover them."

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:10%
