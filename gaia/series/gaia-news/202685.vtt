00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The Christmas Star
on the winter solstice,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.520 align:middle line:10%
a great conjunction
centuries in the making.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.080 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Look to the night
sky on December 21st

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to see a once in a lifetime
astronomical event.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The Christmas Star will
appear in the southwestern sky

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.480 align:middle line:90%
about an hour after sundown.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The so-called star
is actually two

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of the brightest planets in
our solar system, Jupiter

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
As they come together, they
will appear as one large star

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
or a double planet.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter and Saturn travel
together across the sky.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But about every
20 years, Jupiter

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:90%
will catch up and pass Saturn.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:10%
When this happens it's
called a great conjunction.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But the last time the planets
passed so closely to each other

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and in the night sky
was about 800 years ago.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
This event will
remind many Christians

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:10%
of the story of the Star of
Bethlehem, which led the three

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:10%
wise men to the baby Jesus,
hence the name Christmas Star.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:10%
But many people
throughout the world,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:10%
not just Christians,
will celebrate

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:10%
this profound occurrence
and on the winter solstice.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins, science and
history writer and author

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
of "Gobekli Tepe,
Genesis of the Gods,"

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:10%
on how people will celebrate.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:10%
>> The winter solstice, where we
have this incredible planetary

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:10%
alignment, where Jupiter and
Saturn will be so close that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:10%
they will virtually
appear like one beautiful,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:10%
brilliant star in the sky.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So to some people,
it's saying that this

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is the true point of entry
into the age of Aquarius.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
quite extraordinary.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> For the best chances
to see the phenomenon,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
NASA recommends, find a spot
with an unobstructed view

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
of the sky.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
An hour after sunset, look
to the Southwestern sky.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The planets can be seen
with the unaided eye.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But with binoculars, you may
see Jupiter's four moons.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Do your best to see this
phenomenon this time,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
because the great conjunction
won't pass this close again

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
until March 2080.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
