00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Never before have we lived
so out of sync with the rhythms

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.860 align:middle line:10%
of nature.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.189 align:middle line:84%
Can the resulting damage
to our health be reversed?

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.560 align:middle line:10%
The new science of
circadian medicine

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.490 align:middle line:10%
shows great promise
in doing just that.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.266 align:middle line:90%

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
Until the Industrial Revolution,
humans lived in accordance

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:10%
with the natural cycles of light
and dark, or circadian rhythms.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:84%
That all changed with
the advent of electricity

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:90%
and artificial light.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Today, our modern
lifestyles, and especially

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
our exposure to blue light
from electronic devices,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
have been making
a major impact on

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:90%
our internal biological clocks.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Research in an
emerging field called

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:10%
circadian medicine
is finding that there

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:10%
are ways to reset
our circadian systems

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:10%
and bring us back into balance.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:10%
Dr. John Douillard is a
renowned Ayurvedic practitioner

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:10%
who has been
following the latest

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:10%
developments in the
field and incorporating

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:10%
what he calls circadian wisdom
in his practice for years.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
>> So the research is telling us
that there is biological clocks

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:10%
in pretty much every
cell of our body.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But those biological clocks
have to stay-- like every clock,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
you have to set the clock
to make sure it's right

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:90%
and telling the right time.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So the biological
clocks are in sync

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
with the circadian
rhythms, which

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
are the light/dark cycles,
both daytime light/dark

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
cycles and the seasonal
light/dark cycles.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're really regulated
by a molecule called melatonin.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
When you see light, the
melatonin levels shut down

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and things like vitamin D that
you get from the sun activate.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Cortisone levels activate.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So the body gets
energized during the day.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
In the nighttime, when the sun
sets, the opposite happens.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Your cortisone levels
start dialing down,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
because melatonin levels,
as darkness approaches,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:90%
starts to increase.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> As most people today extend
their bedtime way past sunset

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and are exposed to blue light
from electronics throughout

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the day, their melatonin
production is drastically

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.590 align:middle line:84%
lowered at night when
it's most needed.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And as numerous recent
studies have shown,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
this can cause significant
circadian dysregulation.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not allowing
your circadian cycles to kick

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
in, those certain biological
clocks won't turn on or turn

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
off at the right time.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.765 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going into what's

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
called a circadian
medicine imbalance.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article
about, you know,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
the things that can happen with
a circadian medicine imbalance.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have excess blue
light and low melatonin,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
which happens with teenagers
and people who are up a lot.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And the main symptom was
anxiety, worry, depression,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
obviously insomnia.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is the
detoxifier of your brain.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Your brain drains 3 pounds
of plaque and garbage

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
out of your head every
year while you sleep.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you're not
getting enough melatonin

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:10%
to do the night janitor
detox and rebuild and repair

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:10%
and rejuvenate,
then you're going

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:10%
to start to accumulate more
toxicity in your brain.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The field of circadian
medicine came out of studies

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
that showed that certain
medications work better

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:10%
at different times of day.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
This research won a
Nobel Prize in 2017.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It has since been generating
further exploration

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
of circadian regulation and the
behavioral and pharmaceutical

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.870 align:middle line:84%
interventions that
may promote it.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
For John Douillard,
these insights

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
have always been a central focus
of the ancient Indian science

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:90%
of Ayurveda.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What I love about the
circadian medicine science is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's starting to match
up with some of the Ayurvedic

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
I call it the daily
Ayurvedic clock.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, in Ayurveda, there's
a thing called prakash sandhi.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And prakash sandhi means
the junction of light.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the junction of light
is sunrise and sunset.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The new circadian medicine
research points to other

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle factors also
prescribed by Ayurveda.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The ideal day would be waking
up before the sun would rise.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.095 align:middle line:84%
Then you can do some yoga,
some breathing, meditation.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That would be a great thing
to do to start the day.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Then after that, breakfast.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
After you have your breakfast,
probably the most important

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
thing we can do after we eat
our food is go for a walk.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Then a nice big relaxing
lunch somewhere in the middle

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%
of the day would be ideal.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Then in the afternoon, you
know, with a full tank of gas,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
if you eat it in
a relaxed way, you

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
won't get tired
after that big meal.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Then a light supper, if needed.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're calorie restricted
or intermittent fasting,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:90%
that would be the meal to miss.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But you definitely want
to get to bed early.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to get to bed
usually before 10 o'clock.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to burn
fat all night long and break

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the fast in the morning
with that next breakfast.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
circadian clock works.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Ayurveda
predicted thousands

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years ago.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For a complete reset
of one's biological clock,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
studies have shown that time
in nature may be the solution.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one week of
camping with no cell phones

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and artificial light, up with
the sun, bed with the sun,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
reset the circadian
rhythms 100%.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
You can do that at home.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I call it a no artificial
light weekend, where you just

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
turn off all the wi-fi,
don't use any electricity.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Use candles.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And just for an entire weekend,
just go off the grid 100%.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And according to
the research, you

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
got a 68% restoration of
your circadian rhythms.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> With groundbreaking new
research into topics like

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
the effects of melatonin and
the impact of the microbiome

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
on the biological clock, the
future of circadian medicine is

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:90%
promising.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the future of
circadian medicine is where

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda was thousands of
years ago and still is.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
They talked about these
rhythms in such great detail.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
important thing

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.398 align:middle line:84%
to do is live in sync
with the rhythms.

00:05:55.398 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
To be out of sync was to
be out of balance, which

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
means to be distracted, to
be unhappy, to be, you know,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.552 align:middle line:84%
unable to digest and all
these imbalances of health.

00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Ayurveda
was really about

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:84%
is to bring the
body into balance.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Realize it's like a subtle
energy perceiving instrument.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep it
in balance, the body

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
can perceive the
difference between being

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in circadian rhythm and
out of circadian rhythm.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And circadian medicine
is about us getting--

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
taking the struggle
out and getting

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
us to go downstream
with the current.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So, we're headed, you
know, towards the ocean

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:90%
where you're ultimately free.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:10%
