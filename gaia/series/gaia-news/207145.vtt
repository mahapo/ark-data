hovering above US Space Force

Base in Colorado.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980 align:middle line:10%
UFOs have allegedly interfered
with nuclear weapons sites

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.820 align:middle line:10%
before.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:10%
But what is their
interest in Space Force?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.602 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
An alleged UFO caught on camera
by local UFO spotter Jason

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Suraci and posted
on social media

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:10%
appears similar to the Navy's
Tic-Tac video from 2004.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And according to
Suraci, the UFO also

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:10%
shape-shifted into another
figure all together.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
All of this is happening in
the highly populated area

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of Aurora, Colorado,
just east of Denver

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:90%
around Buckley Space Force Base.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
UFO activity around government
facilities is nothing new.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:84%
They have shown an
interest in or concerned

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
with nuclear weapons
and testing grounds.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:10%
In 1967, Bob Salas, then
a US Air Force weapons

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:10%
launch officer at Malmstrom
Air Force base in Montana

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:10%
says UFOs were spotted in the
area followed by something

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:10%
alarming.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:10%
>> I was on alert duty at
the time, March 24, 1967.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
There were two of
us in the capsule

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and I got one call first
that they were seeing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
strange lights in
the sky, and they

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.500 align:middle line:90%
weren't behaving like aircraft.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I kind of dismissed that,
didn't take it too seriously.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But the second call
was very serious

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
because the main security
guard upstairs was then

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:84%
screaming into the phone and he
was very frightened, obviously.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
He was looking at a glowing
red orange object hovering

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.180 align:middle line:90%
above the front gate.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And right after that call, all
kind of our missiles shut down.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So the object was above
us when that happened.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
This was not supposed to happen.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Our systems are very reliable.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
They are not interconnected in
a way where if one missile goes

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:90%
down, they would all go down.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They're independent and they all
went down for the same reason.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.391 align:middle line:84%
That was guidance and
control system failure.

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It wasn't until 1996 when
Salas started speaking publicly

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
about what happened.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And learned there
were more people who

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.111 align:middle line:84%
had the same experience
internationally.

00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:10%
>> As a result of
my coming forward,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:10%
I can say that other people
have also come forward and come

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.850 align:middle line:10%
to me with their stories.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
validate some, others not.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Those that I was
able to validate

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
are in my latest book,
Unidentified UFO Phenomenon,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
including incidents at
NATO bases overseas.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Turning back to the recent
sightings around the Space

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:10%
Force Base in Colorado,
what can we make of this?

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I saw real
quick, it looks authentic.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
As far as the
shape-shifting goes,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I've seen that
many times in UFO videos

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
where the object
seems to change shape.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, Space Force
would be tasked to--

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%
if they believe that these
things are a potential threat

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to our military systems
or defense systems,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
they're going to try to
protect against that threat.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of amusing to me
that a UFO would hover over

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:84%
their facility and say,
well, we're listening to you.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, October 19, 2021
at the National Press Club

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
in Washington DC, Bob Salas and
a panel of former US Air Force

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
officers are holding a
news conference to discuss

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.200 align:middle line:84%
their experiences with
UFOs and nuclear sites.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.936 align:middle line:90%
What do you hope to gain?

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:10%
>> What I look forward to
is public demands for open

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:10%
hearings.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
a lot of pressure,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
I think, from the public to get
Congress to have open hearings.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
By that, I mean, bring in other
witnesses, other documents

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
from open sources,
public sources.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And also bring in witnesses from
various agencies, intelligence

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:84%
agencies, military agencies
who have monitored and tracked

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:90%
this subject for decades.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:10%
We can't just have a secret
group within government

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:10%
deciding what to do about
this very profound reality

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:10%
that indeed we are being
visited by extraterrestrial

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.905 align:middle line:10%
civilizations.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> As someone who has studied
the UFO and extraterrestrial

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.530 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon for
more than 50 years,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:90%
what can we make of this?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're in a new
era now with respect to UFOs.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
any going back now

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:90%
on just ignoring the UFO issue.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But I see a bright future
in moving closer and closer

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:84%
towards disclosure, government
disclosure of what they know.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Our UFO community, let's
say, has to keep at it

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and keep pressing our
government, like I say,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:90%
for open hearings.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And that will open things up.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:10%
