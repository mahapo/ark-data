00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>> A new message for
extraterrestrials,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.280 align:middle line:84%
sending a cosmic hello to any
intelligent life in space.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
How and what to say to
start the conversation

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:90%
with our galactic neighbors?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.265 align:middle line:90%
This is a "Gaia News Breakdown,"

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:20.466 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:84%
When we make contact
with extraterrestrials,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
how will we
communicate with them?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
What if we sent them a
message showing information

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:84%
about Earth, humanity, and our
technological capabilities?

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:10%
That was the idea
behind the Arecibo

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:10%
message in 1974 designed by
Frank Drake and Carl Sagan.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:10%
The now famous message was
the most powerful broadcast

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870 align:middle line:10%
sent into space from the Arecibo
Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The binary message contained
a series of ones and zeros.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:10%
This graphic of
the message shows

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:10%
it consists of our solar system,
strands of DNA, a human figure,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:10%
and chemicals related to
Earth among other things.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, nearly 50 years later,
an international team

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of researchers
introduced a new message

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
intended for extraterrestrials.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:10%
The team led by Jonathan
Jiang of NASA's Jet Propulsion

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:10%
Laboratory felt it was
time to update the Arecibo

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:10%
message since we have come so
far technologically since 1974.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:10%
The proposed message, dubbed
The Beacon in the Galaxy,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:10%
will include some similar
information as Arecibo,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:10%
including, quote, "basic
mathematical and physical

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:10%
concepts to establish
a universal means

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:10%
of communication
followed by information

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:10%
on the biochemical
composition of life on Earth."

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:10%
And it continues, "The message
concludes with digitized images

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:10%
of the human form, along with
an invitation for any receiving

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:10%
intelligences to respond."

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:10%
But how will they transmit
the message into space?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:10%
The Arecibo Radio Telescope
collapsed in December of 2020.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:10%
The researchers proposed using
the Chinese Five-hundred-meter

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:10%
Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope, also known

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:10%
as the FAST Telescope.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:10%
The FAST Telescope is
larger than Arecibo,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:10%
and its performance
and sensitivity

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:10%
are higher than any other
radio telescope in existence.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:10%
Also the SETI Institute's Allen
Telescope Array in California

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:10%
could be used.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But the main problem with both
of these telescopes is that

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
they are receive-only and
cannot yet transmit messages.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The research team
argues both satellites

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:84%
could be upgraded to send
messages with new cutting edge

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Writing, quote, "If so profound
a goal as communication

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
with alien civilizations is to
be realized the powerful tools

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
of FAST and ATA must be paired
with an equally well designed

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and constructed
message to transmit."

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:10%
This thinking is in line
with many experts in space

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:10%
and the search for
extraterrestrial life,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:10%
including Harvard
professor, Avi Loeb,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:10%
who when talking about the
concept of intelligent life

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:10%
in the universe and how
we should look for it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.365 align:middle line:10%
had this to say.

00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:10%
>> AVI LOEB: Well, the most
important thing for us is

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:10%
to recognize the possibility
that we are not alone and that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:10%
we might not be the
smartest kid on the block.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
you have to keep your eyes open

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.548 align:middle line:84%
rather than assume that
we are unique and special

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
and there is nothing out there.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like closing
yourself off at your home

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and not looking
through the window.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do
that, you would never

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
recognize that you
have neighbors.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
That will not make
the neighbors go away.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Just like the fact
that philosophers

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
didn't look through the
telescope of Galileo

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
didn't make the sun
go around the Earth.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They didn't look, they
remained ignorant,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth continues
to move around the sun.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.455 align:middle line:84%
Reality doesn't care
whether we ignore it or not.

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no timeline yet for
when The Beacon in the Galaxy

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:90%
could be transmitted.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:10%
But as research team
lead, Jonathan Jiang,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:10%
told Scientific American,
"This is an invitation

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:10%
to all people on Earth to
participate in a discussion

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:10%
about sending out this message.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.900 align:middle line:10%
We hope, by
publishing this paper,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:10%
we can encourage people
to think about this."

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a "Gaia News Breakdown."
