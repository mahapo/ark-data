The Institute of Noetic Sciences
or IONS has for nearly 50 years

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:10%
been studying the
nature of reality

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
through rigorous
scientific exploration.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
In their latest
study, IONS scientists

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
set out to validate both
the practice of Reiki

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and the phenomenon
of clairvoyance

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:90%
or extended seeing.

Dr. Helane Wahbeh is the
head of research at IONS.

She has been studying
energy medicine for decades.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:10%
>> People who are energy
medicine practitioners might

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:10%
call energy this system that
runs throughout the body that

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:10%
they experience energetic,
magnetic, tingling,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:10%
et cetera around the body.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And one type of
energy medicine, which

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:10%
is commonly used now around
the world is called Reiki.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:10%
And Reiki is a technique
that originated in Japan.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:10%
And it's based on the principle
that the therapist can actually

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:10%
channel energy into the
patient and activate

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:10%
their natural healing
process, their innate ability

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:10%
to heal themselves,
often releasing obstacles

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:10%
and allowing an optimal
flow throughout the body.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Reiki is one of the best
studied energy medicine

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
modalities, having been shown
in clinical studies to be

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:84%
effective in conditions,
including pain, anxiety,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:90%
depression, and others.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:10%
In this IONS
experiment, researchers

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:10%
wanted to study
the effect of Reiki

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:10%
on people with a variety of
physical and mental health

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:10%
conditions.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:10%
To test the principle that the
modality uses a universal life

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:10%
force energy and can
therefore be applied

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:10%
to anyone for any condition.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We had six Reiki masters
with extensive experience give

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
30-minute sessions
to 40 participants.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:90%
The participant would come in.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They would lay down in
this reclining chair,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and the Reiki practitioner
would say that they were

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:90%
going to start their session.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
place their hands

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
on different parts of their
body and direct the Reiki energy

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:90%
for 30 minutes.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> The results were profound.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We saw that, yes, well-being,
which is our primary clinical

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
outcome, significantly improved
from the session immediately

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:90%
after and also one week later.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And that negative
affect also improved.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:10%
The participants had
multiple different types

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:10%
of health conditions, memory
impairment, depression,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:10%
anxiety, and acute injury.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:10%
So these are four very different
types of health issues.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:10%
And yet, across all
of the participants,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.650 align:middle line:10%
we saw an improvement
in well-being,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:10%
and this supports the notion
that Reiki practitioners

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:10%
suggest, which is that
Reiki is universal.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal life force
energy and can help anybody.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>> While these results
were significant

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in and of themselves,
researchers incorporated

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
another fascinating component
into the experiment.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
While the Reiki sessions
were being conducted,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
six experienced clairvoyant
seers observed the sessions.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Various forms of data
were then collected

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether the
information the clairvoyants

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
were receiving through
their extended perception

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:90%
was accurate.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:10%
Researchers then
analyzed the data

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.900 align:middle line:10%
to answer several
important questions.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the different perceivers
perceive in the same way?

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:10%
What is the corroboration
in what they

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:10%
received during the session.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:10%
Did the Reiki masters answers
match up with the perceivers?

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Did it match up with
the participant?

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:90%
