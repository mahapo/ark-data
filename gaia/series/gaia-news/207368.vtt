00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Laser mapping reveals nearly
500 ancient ceremonial sites

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.450 align:middle line:10%
hiding just under the
landscape of modern day Mexico,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and lead scientists to
revise their understandings

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.930 align:middle line:10%
of the origins of the
Maya civilization.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.595 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Eastern Mexico is home
to the ancient Maya,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
renowned for their striking
pyramids, written language,

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and complex calendar system.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It is there that scientists
first discovered Aguada Fénix,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
the largest and oldest
known Maya construction.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:10%
Professor Takeshi Inomata is an
archaeologist at the University

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:10%
of Arizona, who led the study,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:10%
>> We did lidar, which
is airborne laser mapping

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:10%
technique.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Using this technique,
we found Aguada Fénix,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
which is the oldest monumental
construction in the Maya area.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It has a huge plateau,
artificial plateau,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:84%
which has a perfect
rectangular shape

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
measuring 1.4 kilometers
long and 400 meters wide,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:84%
which represents the
largest construction

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:90%
in the entire Maya history.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And then also, it dates to
probably 1100 BC to 800 or 700

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
BC, which makes it the oldest
monumental construction

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Maya area.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So interesting part is
that the largest building

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
happened at the very
beginning all the stage

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:90%
of Maya civilization.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Having made this
extraordinary find,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:10%
the team recently expanded
their search to a broader area,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:10%
using the same cutting
edge lidar technology.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:10%
They were specifically
hoping to find

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:10%
sites built by the Olmec
people, an older civilization

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:10%
thought to have influenced
the development of the Maya.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
What lidar revealed
was groundbreaking.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we found nearly
500 ceremonial complex,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.540 align:middle line:84%
which look like Aguada Fénix,
although they are not as big

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:90%
as Aguada Fénix.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
This distribution
shows they shared

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
similar concept of
space, ritual, and then

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
probably about the worldview.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that people in the
Olmec area and the Maya area

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:90%
really exchanged ideas.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then that kind
of interaction

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:84%
was very important for
the initial development

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of Mesoamerican civilizations.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Just what do the findings
show about these early

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Mesoamerican people?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the earliest evidence
for the gathering of really

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
large number of people.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Those people probably did not
have too much hierarchical

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%
organizations.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
They most likely did not
have kings or elites.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have very much
marked social inequalities.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So those people, without
clear social inequality,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
gathered and they
organized themselves.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then made these
huge constructions

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
which really make us rethink
about the development

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and possibility of
human societies.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Not just about Mesoamerica but
the human societies in general.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Freddy Silva is a researcher
and author who has extensively

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:10%
studied these ancient people,
tracing their roots to a much

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:10%
older civilization.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a big remnant
of a very large civilization,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:10%
which it began after this
sort of island continent

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the Eastern ocean,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:10%
called Atl back in the day.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Sank and we received the
survivors in 9600 BC.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
It's a very specific date at
the end of the Great Flood.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just that they
came from the Atlantic.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The survivors also
came from the Pacific.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So now we're looking at
something much bigger.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a story because not
only are these cities that

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
are being discovered by lidar,
as a remnant of a civilization

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that came from the East,
they also came from the West

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.075 align:middle line:84%
We have the migration
of two different groups

00:04:37.075 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
of people, which
made up the Mayan

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:90%
culture into what it became.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What is known about
these groups of people?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:10%
>> These people arrived
in groups of seven.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:10%
There were various teachers.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They were experts
in their field.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, these were people
who were really much more

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:84%
into the nuts and bolts of what
the spiritual system is all

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:84%
They want to know more
than the average person.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So they became part
of a priesthood,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
which is open to men, women,
and anyone who is curious.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And they would spend years,
anywhere between 5 to 10 years,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:90%
learning the mysteries.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
These are people who
settled down and spread

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
the culture across the whole
of Yucatan and into Guatemala.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I quote, "As a mirror
image of the sunken homelands

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:90%
of the gods."

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:10%
So what we see
today in the jungle

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:10%
are essentially copies
of the originals,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:10%
which are now thousands
of feet under the ocean.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Much more remains to be
known about the history of these

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
fascinating civilizations, and
plans are underway for further

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't get
away from digging.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Discovering the past is a very
difficult and time-entailed

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
As a researcher, I can
tell you it's not easy,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
unless you actually look at
the past from different lenses.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at it from
the point of view of mythology

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and folklore, climatology
and how people

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.157 align:middle line:90%
were thinking at the time.

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And that requires talking to a
lot of people with an open mind

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:90%
to bring a kind of consensus.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
For my part, I would like to see
the lidar and the archaeology

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
go to the deepest
parts of Guatemala

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.780 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
Itz eventually settled.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect this lidar
becoming much more of a tool.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find some
very, very big news coming out

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
of Guatemala, Belize
and even further south.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
This is just a tip
of the iceberg,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm concerned.
