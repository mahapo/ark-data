00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.900 align:middle line:10%
- A possible resolution
to the Fermi paradox

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:10%
and new targets to search
for extraterrestrial life

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.500 align:middle line:10%
in space, this is a
Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:10%
- Anyone curious about the
existence of extraterrestrials

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:10%
has heard about
the Fermi paradox,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:10%
named after famed
physicist Enrico Fermi.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The story goes: in a
lunchtime conversation

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
with other scientists
who reasoned

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that given the vast size
and age of the universe,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
it stands to reason there
must be other intelligent life

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
out there, to which Fermi
asked where is everybody?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, astrobiologist Michael
Wong of the Carnegie Institution

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:10%
for Science and Stuart
Bartlett of the California

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:10%
Institute of Technology
offer their hypothesis.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's a bit dark.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Using studies of the
growth of cities on Earth,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
they argue that
civilizations grow infinitely

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:90%
but in a finite time.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
This infinite growth of
population and overuse

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
of energy will eventually
lead to the death

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
of the civilization, or
possibly saving themselves,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
writing, quote, "we propose
a new resolution to the Fermi

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:90%
paradox.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations either
collapse from burnout

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
or redirect themselves to
prioritizing homeostasis,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
a state where cosmic
expansion is no longer a goal,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
making them difficult
to detect remotely."

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:10%
So they argue if an advanced
civilization in space

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.980 align:middle line:10%
has grown like cities on
Earth, they have died out

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:10%
or, if they recognized their
dire situation early enough,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:10%
have shifted priorities from
interplanetary exploration

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:10%
to planetary survival
through homeostasis.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The authors note that
this is just a hypothesis

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and is intended
to, quote, "provoke

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
discussion, introspection,
and future work."

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Meanwhile, a possible
new target in the search

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:10%
for extraterrestrial life.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
A new study out of the
University of Copenhagen

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
shows nearly half of
sun-sized stars are binary.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Since Earth, the only known
planet with intelligent life,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
orbits a single star,
the sun, astronomers

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
have looked for
Earth like planets

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
with a single star
in their search

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
for extraterrestrial life.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, professor Jes Kristian
Jorgensen, who led the study,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:10%
says planetary systems that
form around binary stars

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:10%
do so in a way that
is much different

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:10%
than around single stars,
saying in a statement, quote,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%
"the result is exciting
since the search

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:10%
for extraterrestrial
life will be equipped

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:10%
with several new, extremely
powerful instruments

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:10%
within the coming years.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This enhances the
significance of understanding

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
how planets are formed around
different types of stars.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Such results may
pinpoint places which

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
would be especially
interesting to probe

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
for the existence of life."

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The researchers note that the
system is too young for planets

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to have formed but hope
to observe the formation

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:90%
of planetary systems.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps there, we will
see the first evidence

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent life
growing in outer space.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
