Results from a new
galactic survey

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.210 align:middle line:90%
may have narrowed the search.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%
A recent study analyzing
the work of the Kepler Space

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Telescope and the European Space
Agency's Gaia Space Observatory

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
found that about half of
sun-like stars in our galaxy

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.990 align:middle line:10%
could host Earth-like rocky
planets capable of supporting

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:10%
liquid water on its surface.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
According to NASA, the
conservative estimate

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
puts that number at about 300
million potentially habitable

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%
worlds in our galaxy.

Astronomy and Astrophysics

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:10%
at Penn State
University on the study.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:10%
>> What this study does, it
takes the final release of all

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:10%
that Kepler did, the very best
version of the data that's been

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:10%
worked on for years, and
combines it with precise

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:10%
properties measured of all of
those stars by the European

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Space Agency's Gaia
mission, measured distances

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:10%
and brightness of
stars very precisely.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And they put all
of this information

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
together to try
and estimate what

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
fraction of all
stars in the galaxy

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
have Earth-like planets
around sun-like stars.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So they've picked a
pretty generous definition

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
of what makes a
planet Earth-like

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and a star star-like,
sun-like, and the temperature

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:90%
kind of like Earth.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking
at any planet that's

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
as small as half of
the size of Earth

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to as large as 1 and 1/2
times the size of Earth,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:90%
around a wide range of stars.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But all of them at about
the right distance where

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
if the planets had an atmosphere
like Earth's, it would have

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:90%
liquid water on the surface.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't know what fraction
of those are going to have it.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Why does water on the
surface of a planet matter?

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.988 align:middle line:84%
What's the significance of
finding an Earth-like planet?

00:02:10.988 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The Kepler mission was
designed to look for a planet

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
like Earth.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for our
context in the universe.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.133 align:middle line:84%
We want to know if there
are other planets out there.

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
reason is, because we

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
want to know if
there's life out there.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we really
want to know, is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
if there's intelligent life
out there that perhaps we

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:90%
could someday communicate with.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
But along the way,
we need to know where

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:90%
to look and study these things.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.184 align:middle line:84%
And so we're working our way
through the Drake equation.

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Marc D'Antonio, astronomer
and chief photo and video

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:10%
analyst for the
Mutual UFO Network,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:10%
was excited to hear this news.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:10%
>> The most exciting thing is,
that there may be an awful lot

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:10%
of other Earths out there, an
awful lot of other habitable

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:10%
worlds just in our galaxy.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you think about that, that's
really wonderful to know that,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:90%
hey, maybe we're not alone.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:90%
I personally don't think we are.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's, my
book is about the fact

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that life in the universe is
the rule, not the exception.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is, that there's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
another one or two trillion
other galaxies besides our own.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.497 align:middle line:84%
Now the numbers just
stagger and boggle the mind.

00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And it really tells you that
the universe might actually

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.893 align:middle line:84%
be teeming with
life, but they just

00:03:31.893 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
can't communicate
with each other.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that we have
this information,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
what does this mean
for the search for life

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in the universe?

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that we have studies
indicating that there might be

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
a certain definitive number of
habitable worlds like the Earth

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in our galaxy, we would want
to study those worlds to see

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
if they're not just
rocky like Mercury,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
but actually have an
atmosphere like Earth.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So to do that, we have the
James Webb Space Telescope--

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
--Which is going to
be going up and it'll

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
be parked about a million miles
away from the Earth in what's

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:90%
called a Lagrange point.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like a parking spot in
space for all the gravity

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
sums to 0 and you can just sort
of hover with minimal effort

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:90%
stay in the same spot.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it can do
that, then it'll

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.835 align:middle line:84%
be able to have a
wonderful vantage

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
point from which
to start looking

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
at some of these potential
habitable worlds.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> This study is just the latest
in the search for life in outer

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:10%
Scientists around the
world are using every tool

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:10%
and inventing new ones to
explore our galaxy and beyond.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The James Webb Space Telescope
is scheduled for an October

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
2021 launch, and
with it, we may just

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
find the next piece of evidence
to answer the question,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:90%
are we alone in the universe.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:10%
