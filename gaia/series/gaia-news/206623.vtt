>> Scientists have created a new
phase of matter known as time

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.700 align:middle line:10%
crystals, a quantum phenomenon
appearing to defy the laws

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:10%
of thermodynamics.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Could this discovery
uppend our understanding

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 align:middle line:90%
of classical physics?

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
A team of researchers developing
Google's Sycamore quantum

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:10%
computer announced the
successful creation

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:10%
of a time crystal that
lasted for 100 seconds.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:10%
This novel phase
of matter appears

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:10%
to defy the second law
of thermodynamics, which

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
states that entropy,
or chaos and disorder,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:10%
always increases in
an isolated system.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:10%
In other words, energy must
be put into a system in order

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:10%
to maintain structure or
motion, but time crystals

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
have been observed to maintain
a constant state of flux

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:10%
without losing any energy.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Simeon Hein, director of
the Institute of Resonance,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
explains the science behind
the strange phenomenon.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Crystals are in everything
that we do, because--

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
they're in watches--
they're in so many things

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:10%
because they're regular.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:90%
They create evenness.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:90%
They create this consistency.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Just like their pattern
is very consistent,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
the energy that
crystals transmit

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
turns into a very
regular pattern,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
which is why you can use a
quartz crystal in a watch.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
You can put kind of a
noisy electrical signal in,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.200 align:middle line:84%
but it'll come out as
a very consistent beat.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that created the
idea for some people,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
in this case Frank
Wilczek from MIT in 2012,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to propose the idea that you
not only had crystals in space,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
you could have crystals in time.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
You could create a sort
of oscillating circuit.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Using specific
quantum principles,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you could create a very
constant quantum beat.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Time crystals have been
described as the first

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:10%
out-of-equilibrium
phase of matter,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:10%
meaning they maintain order
while in an excited state.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:10%
But how do time
crystals accomplish this

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:10%
without expending energy?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> At a quantum level, they're
getting energy from something

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
we call the zero
point energy field.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The zero point energy field
is the lowest ground state

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:90%
of quantum matter.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But the lowest state
doesn't mean, like,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
absolute zero, like
nothing is happening,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
because the quantum
ground state is actually

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
the base state of the universe
where, even though there's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:84%
nothing happening, the
field itself generates

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
energy and causes
random fluctuations,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and particles to
pop out of nowhere,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of really
interesting effects

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that normally, I should
say most of the time,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
we don't see in our
regular physical reality.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So these coherently
entangled particles

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
would be deriving their energy
from the quantum vacuum field.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But if they're getting their
energy from the quantum

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:84%
vacuum instead of
our classical world,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
you can't see any reason
why they would eventually

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
have to wind down, like
our regular clocks would,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and energy would dissipate.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>> With this new discovery of
time crystals appearing to defy

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
the second law of
thermodynamics,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
how has mainstream science
reacted or tried to reconcile

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:90%
this paradox?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of these quantum
phenomena seem to defy

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:90%
classical physics.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
quantum entanglement

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
suggests faster-than-light
interaction or communication.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Einstein called it "spooky
action at a distance."

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And experiments later
confirmed that you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
could take pairs of
particles and separate them,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and you would do something
to one of the particles.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The other particle would,
you know, immediately react,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
instantly react, at farther
and farther distances away.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As scientists continue to
examine the baffling mechanisms

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
of particles at
the quantum scale,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
what implications could this
have at the macro scale?

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Could this explain
paranormal phenomena

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
or lead to the creation of
a perpetual motion device?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It suggests that things
could be possible that you

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe in before,
things like remote viewing

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and phenomena around UFOs
and things like this.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:84%
It could tell us about
some of these phenomena,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps there's
a quantum component

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to some of what's called
paranormal phenomena.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And this sort of
research gets it going.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the real issue
in quantum mechanics.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Where do quantum
principles apply?

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be poltergeists
or some of the weird time

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
anomalies people experience
around-- you know,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the missing time phenomena
that people experience

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:90%
around UFO encounters.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And other encounters
like that, even Bigfoot,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a quantum component
to them, Bigfoot encounters,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the effects on
electronics and batteries.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So this sort of
questioning in research

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.600 align:middle line:84%
could possibly lead
in that direction.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:10%
>> While researchers work
to create time crystals that

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:10%
maintain coherence for
more than a few minutes,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:10%
this latest iteration lasted
exponentially longer than when

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:10%
they were first
discovered in 2016.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Will the Google team
be able to create

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
a state of significant
coherence for time

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:90%
crystals in the future?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And what else can we learn
from these enigmatic quantum

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:90%
crystals?

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are continuing
to study the implications

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:90%
of this discovery.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
