00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:10%
January 2021, wealthy aerospace
entrepreneur Robert Bigelow

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:10%
announced a contest.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.770 align:middle line:10%
Provide the best
evidence of, quote,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:10%
"the survival of consciousness
after permanent bodily death"

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:10%
for almost $1 million
in prize money.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Over 1,000 entrants
sought to prove life

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:90%
after physical death.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jeffrey Long has studied
near-death experience

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:10%
for 20 years and was a
runner-up in the contest.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:10%
In his essay, Dr.
Long broke down

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
12 lines of evidence for life
after physical death common

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:10%
among near-death experiencers
around the world.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Of the three most
important, first

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is cardiac arrest
and brain death.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Immediately, when your
heart stops beating, of course,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:10%
blood instantly stops
flowing to the brain.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:10%
10 to 15 seconds after blood
stops flowing to the brain,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:10%
maybe up to 20 seconds, the EEG,
or electroencephalogram, which

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:10%
is a measure of brain electrical
activity goes absolutely flat.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.973 align:middle line:10%
There's no measurable
electricity

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:10%
going on that's
measurable in the brain.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:10%
It should be, in
those circumstances,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:10%
impossible to have any kind of
a lucid memory at that time.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by the
hundreds, we have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
people reporting near-death
experiences exactly

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
at that time, highly lucid
and organized experiences

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
consistent with near-death
experiences occurring

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
under all other times, and that
should be medically, absolutely

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:90%
impossible.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Next, the sensation of
floating above the physical

00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.075 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The initial event is what we
call an out-of-body experience.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness rises
above the physical body

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and from that vantage
point over the body,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.460 align:middle line:84%
they can see ongoing,
earthly events or hear them.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And they often are visualizing
people frantically trying

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
to bring them back to life.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
What they see in that
out-of-body experience

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is overwhelmingly accurate,
down to the finest details.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if their consciousness
leaves the area of their body

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and goes some place far
from their physical body,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:84%
far from any possible physical
sensory awareness, what they

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
can see and hear is
almost invariably--

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about my
study-- about 98% accurate

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:90%
down to the finest details.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> His third line of evidence
is near-death experiences

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:90%
in the blind.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I've studied and interviewed
an individual who was born

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:10%
totally blind.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:10%
When she had her
near-death experience,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:10%
it was stunningly visual.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I have a series
now of people

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
who are severely visually
impaired or legally blind

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and in all of those
cases in my series,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
their vision during their
near-death experience

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
is either normal or even
super-normal awareness,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
dramatic, kind of,
supernormal vision,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
supernormal sensory awareness
that we see over and over again

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
in near-death experiences that
would be absolutely beyond what

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:90%
anybody could normally imagine.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
All lines of evidence and
others that I have all

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
converging on the conclusion
that near-death experiences

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.760 align:middle line:90%
are, in a word, real.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we learn from the
phenomena of shared near-death

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We now have a series of
about 16 near-death experiences,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
where two or more people had a
simultaneous life-threatening

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.930 align:middle line:90%
event.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
They had near-death experiences,
and remarkably, they

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
were aware of each other during,
with their consciousness,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
apart from their body, each
having a near-death experience.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Able to communicate with each
other, typically, and able to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
talk, aware, that they
were-- their physical bodies

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
were down there.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
In general, in this series of
shared near-death experience,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
one person dies irreversibly,
they're not resuscitated.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The other person
comes back to life

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.969 align:middle line:84%
and is able to share a very
remarkable shared near-death

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's important
because that's

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
some of the strongest evidence
we have so far from any source

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:84%
that what's described in
the near-death experience

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
may well be that initial step
towards permanent irreversible

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%
death for all of us.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest
unanswered question--

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
why do some people have
an out-of-body experience

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and others do not?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
One possibility--

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a
near-death experience,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:84%
like the Rosetta Stone, of
understanding why some do

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and don't, but this very
dramatic near-death experience

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.558 align:middle line:84%
was in an unearthly, if
you will, heavenly realm.

00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were
communicating with what

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.510 align:middle line:84%
they very firmly believed to
be God and asked God directly--

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
it was an overwhelmingly,
blissful, peaceful, loving

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.288 align:middle line:84%
near-death experience
emotions beyond anything

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
they could have
experienced on Earth,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:84%
which is very common in
near-death experiences.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And because this was such
a positive experience,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:90%
she asked God directly, why me?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Why was I so special that
this should happen to me?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And God answered to her, in
the near-death experience,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:90%
love falls on everyone equally.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what you needed
to live your earthly life.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's a possible explanation
of why some have near-death

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:90%
experiences and some don't

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Long hopes the field of
near-death experience will move

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
from reactive study
to proactive study--

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
being able to speak to people
after being resuscitated

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:84%
about anything
they may have seen

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
or felt while technically
dead as standard operating

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:90%
procedure.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps then, humans
can definitively

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
prove there is an afterlife.
