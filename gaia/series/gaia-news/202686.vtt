00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.200 align:middle line:10%
>> A galactic federation of
extraterrestrials exists,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.260 align:middle line:10%
and world leaders know about it.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:10%
Haim Eshed, the former head of
the Israeli Defense Ministry's

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.910 align:middle line:10%
space division, made this
claim in a new interview

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
with Israeli paper,
Yedioth Ahronoth,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
telling the paper aliens have
been in contact with the United

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
States and Israeli
governments for years,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
but asked humans not to
reveal their presence

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:10%
because the general
public is not ready.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
He went on to say aliens
and human astronauts

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
are working in underground
bases on Mars, their mission

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
fabric of the universe,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
to find out what this all means.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:10%
We turn to Nick Pope
who worked for the UK's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:10%
Ministry of Defense
investigating UFOs

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:10%
in the 1990s.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Frankly, there's not much
middle ground with something

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:10%
like this.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:10%
This isn't some vague
hint that's been dropped.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:10%
This is up close and
personal direct allegations.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a Galactic
Federation, an alien presence.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:90%
We're being visited.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Governments know all about it
and were about to disclose,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
but drew back at
the last moment.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Underground bases
on Mars, I mean,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.990 align:middle line:84%
either this is some sort
of elaborate practical joke

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
or publicity stunt, or
somebody genuinely in the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:90%
know is breaking ranks.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Haim Eshed's claims
may be extraordinary,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
but he is not the only high
ranking government official

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to come out with
disclosure stories.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some interesting
parallels here with Paul

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Hellyer.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Hellyer, of course, was
the former Canadian defense

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:90%
minister.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And indeed at one time
Deputy Prime Minister,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and he went on the
record some years

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
ago as saying,
absolutely, there's

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
presence and some people,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
within particularly the
United States government,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:90%
know all about it.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
There have been some previous
high level whistleblowers.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:10%
One who comes to mind is
Admiral of the Fleet Lord Hill

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Norton, Britain's most
senior military officer, who

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:10%
some years ago said,
again absolutely firmly,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:10%
there's an alien
presence, there's

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:10%
an associated
government cover up.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
These were extraordinary
statements from somebody

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
who effectively was the
British equivalent of Chairman

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Joint Chiefs.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> If humanity is not
yet ready for disclosure,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:84%
how will alien life
reveal themselves to us?

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I think these Israeli
revelations have to be

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
contextualized, and there's
a lot of other things going

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
on right now.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
The Senate Intelligence
Committee earlier this year

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
demanded a report
from the director

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:90%
of National Intelligence.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.140 align:middle line:84%
In response, the Pentagon set
up something called the UAP Task

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Force.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena, that's the term

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:90%
we use in government for UFOs.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
some intriguing leaks

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
from this organization.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
it's disclosure

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, my fellow
Americans, people of the world,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
we're not alone, but
it's pretty darn close.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> With these latest revelations
as well as the US establishment

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of a UAP Task Force,
what will come next?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Within governments,
the military,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence community,
and specifically within people

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
who have had some exposure
to this phenomenon,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:90%
is there more to come?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, watch this space.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:10%
We are on one hell
of a ride right now,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:10%
and it's going to get even
more interesting, I guarantee.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Another high ranking
government official speaking

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:10%
out about aliens among us,
this time not just claims

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:10%
of extraterrestrial life,
but of human interaction

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:10%
and the government cover up.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Will we see disclosure?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
According to this report,
when humans are ready.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
