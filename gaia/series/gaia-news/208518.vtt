00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>> New research suggests that
times of global unrest present

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.039 align:middle line:84%
a unique opportunity
for neurological growth

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and profound behavior change,
but only when leveraged

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.970 align:middle line:90%
correctly.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important
for us to become aware

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:84%
of our psychologically and
neurologically vulnerable state

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Kayla Osterhoff is a
neuropsychophysiologist

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:10%
who studies the interaction
of the mind and brain, which

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:10%
she calls the human
operating system.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the greatest mysteries
in modern neuroscience is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:10%
actually how the brain
produces the mind.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
we have not been

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with
the answer for this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
is because that's
not how it works.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
These two are actually separate
systems that interact together

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to produce what I call
the human operating

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
system, which is responsible
for our version of reality

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:90%
as human.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Osterhoff has recently been
researching the hypothesis that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:84%
times of social unrest
provide a valuable opportunity

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to neurologically upgrade
this human operating system.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now we have this very
unique opportunity to upgrade

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
our human operating
system globally,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and that is because as a society
around the entire world we are

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:90%
experiencing this social unrest.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And this has caused a couple
of significant cognitive

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
and neurological
shifts that have

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
provided an opportunity
for us to grow and evolve

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
as a society.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Osterhoff points to several
fascinating factors that

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
contribute to this phenomenon.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So studies are showing that
acute states of stress like

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
shock or trauma or something
surprising like what

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
we're currently experiencing in
our world cause this cognitive

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
psychological shift that
actually makes our subconscious

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670 align:middle line:84%
mind more suggestible meaning
that our subconscious mind is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:84%
brought forward, so to speak,
and it's more malleable.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It's more programmable.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If you look back at
clinical hypnosis research

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and Eriksonian
research-- he was kind

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
of the father of
clinical hypnosis--

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
he found in his research that
shock and surprise are actually

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
a form of hypnotic
induction that

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
can be utilized to reprogram the
subconscious mind or increase

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
subconscious suggestibility.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Another contributing factor
Osterhoff has uncovered has

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
to do with the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So neuroplasticity refers
to the way that our neurons,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
our brain cells fire
and wire together.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And neuroplasticity
increases our ability

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
to change and reshape
these neural pathways.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The second opportunity
that we have right

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
now is a global increase
in neuroplasticity.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Now in these times of unrest,
our lives have been upended

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and our patterns have shifted,
and we're experiencing

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:90%
things for the first time.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So because of this our
globe is experiencing

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
heightened neural plasticity
and heightened subconscious

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:90%
suggestibility.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the implications
of these findings?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the opportunity here is
that we can leverage these two

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:84%
abilities to change and grow
and evolve and shift and learn

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to our benefit, or if we
remain unaware of this,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
we can be shifted in a way that
is detrimental to us as well.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.570 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you
want to quit smoking

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
or you want to change
some kind of behavior,

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
you have a greater
ability to do that

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:90%
right now than ever before.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And on the opposite
side of things,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
if you're spending this
time in fear or in worry,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
you risk hard-wiring in those
behaviors into your physiology.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Because this is happening
on a mass scale,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
our world has a greater capacity
to evolve and shift and grow

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:90%
than it ever has before.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:90%
So we need to leverage this.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
We need to take
advantage so that we

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
can make the positive
changes that we want

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:90%
to see in the world happen.
