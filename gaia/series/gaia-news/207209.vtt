00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.660 align:middle line:10%
>> What do near-death
experiences suggest about

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.930 align:middle line:10%
the ultimate source of
reality, spirituality,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.660 align:middle line:10%
and what many call God?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:10%
Psychiatrist Raymond Moody
explains in his new book,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:10%
"God is Bigger Than the Bible."

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.925 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Raymond Moody has spent
more than four decades

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:10%
studying the afterlife.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:84%
In his 1975 book,
"Life After Life,"

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.680 align:middle line:84%
he first presented his research
on the Near-Death Experience,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
or NDE, the transcendent
experience of death

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that radically transforms
the life of the person who

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:90%
lives to tell about it.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
In his new book, "God is
Bigger Than the Bible,"

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Moody presents
his thoughts on God

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:10%
drawn from the accounts
of the thousands of people

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:10%
he has interviewed about
their near-death experiences.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was a kid, I
didn't think about God.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:10%
I can't say I was an atheist
because I never really

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:10%
thought about God--

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:10%
then went to college
and got interested

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:10%
in these near-death
experiences through Plato

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:10%
and, subsequently, have heard of
thousands of these from people

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:10%
all over the world who have
this same kind of experience.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Many of them have
conversations with God.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
how I came to God.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And God has become just
a big part of my life

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:90%
in the last few decades.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Moody's motivation for
writing his latest book is

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.370 align:middle line:84%
to provide readers with an
understanding of God or source

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that is entirely outside the
realm of organized religion.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
To Dr. Moody,
ideological religion

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
can present a
fearsome image of God

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
that has scared many
away from developing

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
a personal relationship
with the divine.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before I started
hearing people with near-death

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
experiences, my notion of
God was that people had this

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
imaginary figure who was
watching their every step with

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
a little book, trying to see
if they're going to stumble

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
hearing these people

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with near-death experiences,
it was a whole different take

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:90%
on God.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
People say that when they
had their cardiac arrest

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:90%
or whatever--

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that they left their bodies and
they dissolved into this light,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
almost.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
People say that what kind of
love that you have experienced

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
while you're alive--

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that this is just absolutely
beyond description.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
You go through a passageway into
this light of complete comfort

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:90%
and peace and love.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:90%
You feel just wrapped up in it.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> A common component of the
NDE is what is known as the life

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
review.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> People say they are
surrounded by holographic

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:84%
panorama consisting of
everything they've ever done.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And they witness
it from the point

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
of view of the other people
with whom they've interacted.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
being experienced

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of a being of
complete compassion and love

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
who sees all those things
they've done there,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:84%
but there's no judgment
coming from this--

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that this being is helping
you evaluate these things.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
there are no words,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but that the thought
comes through.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The question that
comes from this being

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
is, how have you
learned to love?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
People learn a lot
about themselves

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%
from these encounters with God.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Through his research, both
with near-death experiencers

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and the elderly, Dr. Moody has
come to an understanding of God

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.560 align:middle line:84%
as the writer of
our life stories.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your
life but your story?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Your whole consciousness is
geared to create a story.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
As soon as some new event
happens in your life,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
your mind immediately starts to
weave it into your life story.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
What this life has to
do with is our stories.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And we go through one
story, and then we

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
go through some sort of
incomprehensible process.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we come back
on another story line.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:90%
What degree God is--

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
helps us choose the
plot, I don't know.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
My guess would be
that there would

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:90%
be a kind of advice process--

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:90%
is what-- the sense I get.

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> After decades
of research, Dr.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Moody feels like there is now a
growing shift in understandings

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We are beginning to
understand, I think,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
better what it might mean to say
that our consciousness can go

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:90%
on even after we die.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.380 align:middle line:90%
The world is about to open up.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
We will have whole
new ways of addressing

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
the question of an afterlife.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
People say that in their
near-death experiences,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
when they get over
to the other side--

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
that God is much more
accessible there.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And my question is,
if we get closer

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to a rational comprehension
of life after death,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
will that bring
us closer to God?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
When people begin to
comprehend the whole notion

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
of an afterlife with entirely
new systems of thinking,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.440 align:middle line:84%
then that will open them up more
to personal contact with God.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And for Dr. Moody, it is that
personal contact that makes all

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:90%
the difference.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:10%
