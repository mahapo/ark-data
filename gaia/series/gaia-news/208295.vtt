>> A new study records the
brain waves of a dying person

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.200 align:middle line:10%
in detail for the
very first time.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Can the findings explain what
happens during our transition

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.550 align:middle line:90%
into death?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we can learn about
the brain and its relationship

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to a phenomenal
experience, the better.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
While there is plenty of
anecdotal evidence from people

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
who have had Near-Death
Experiences or NDEs,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:10%
there is little to no
hard scientific data

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:10%
on what happens in the
brain as people are dying.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Now researchers who recorded 15
minutes of brainwave activity

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in a dying man are speculating
that the findings may

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:84%
explain the phenomenon
of life recall

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
or review that
many NDErs report.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon
who in 2008 experienced an NDE

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:10%
as he lay in a coma
caused by a serious case

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:10%
of bacterial
meningoencephalitis.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:84%
After a miraculous
recovery, he went on

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to study and write
about the experience

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:90%
in several bestselling books.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a tremendous amount
of evidence that at the end

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:10%
of life, our consciousness does
not just disappear as one might

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:10%
assume if the brain
created consciousness.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, our
conscious awareness

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:84%
seems to expand
in dramatic ways.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is where a
deeper understanding of NDEs

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
is crucial for us to understand
the mind-brain relationship

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
consciousness itself.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> To Dr. Alexander, while the
study is a step in the right

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
direction towards understanding
what happens when we die,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
it is fraught with
some misunderstandings.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there are many
problems with the study,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and the main things that I'll
point out here is first of all,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
do not confuse correlation
with causality.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a common
mistake in neuroscience,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and it results from the
unproven assumption-- in fact,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I would say a
disproven assumption--

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
creating consciousness.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, to
find any change

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
in phenomenal
consciousness, we must

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
look for a neural correlate,
some physiologic change

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And modern studies just show
that that reasoning is false,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that we have to--
there's more to it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:84%
than just what's
going on in the brain.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the strongest
evidence for this thinking

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
comes out of recent studies
using sophisticated brain

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
imaging of participants
on psychedelics.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:10%
>> They universally show a
decrease in brain activity

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:10%
and a dissolution of things like
the default mode network that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:10%
is thought to be so responsible
for our sense of self

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:10%
and existence in the moment.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And if those things kind
of dissolve and disappear

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
under the influence of these
plant medicines or entheogens,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
as I like to call
them, all other bets

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
about looking at
neuronal activity

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
to try and match it up
to phenomenal experience

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:90%
are really off.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
to get is the brain

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
is not the creator of these
phenomenal experiences.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a filter, so it influences
the experience that we have.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's not ultimately the
complete explanation for them.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What can be said about the
findings of the recent study

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that the pattern
of brain activity recorded

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to memory recall,
and may provide a physiological

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:84%
basis for the life review
as experienced by NDErs?

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Memories that are encountered
in near-death experiences such

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
as the life review are not just
vague, sepia-tinted memories.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
These are reliving
of the events in

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:90%
a detailed, powerful fashion.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Memories are not even
stored in the brain.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the last
nails in the coffin

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:90%
of materialist neuroscience.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Alexander and other
proponents of a broader

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:84%
approach to studying dying have
high hopes that we are headed

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> The message is very clear.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
When you study consciousness
in large fashion,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
including all the evidence
for non-local consciousness

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and the rich reports of
near-death and shared death

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
experiences,
out-of-body experiences,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, things like
that, and then of course

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:84%
you get into that rich
literature on reincarnation,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
all this is telling
us is we need

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
a much bigger
theater of operations

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
to explain all this than our
simple notions of the material

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and physical world
being all there is.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a pathway forward
for a deeper understanding

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
of what happens when we die.
