>> As cryptocurrencies like
Bitcoin break new records

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.189 align:middle line:10%

and Cultural Revolution?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Or are we not quite there yet?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:10%
Cryptocurrencies
have recently gained

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:10%
popularity as an alternative to
conventional monetary systems.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:84%
Blockchain is a system in
which a record of transactions

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
made in Bitcoin or
another cryptocurrency

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.750 align:middle line:84%
are maintained across several
computers that are linked

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:90%
in a peer-to-peer network.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:10%
Crypto has no centralized bank
controlling the flow of money,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
but rather a
decentralized system

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:10%
controlled by algorithms.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Crypto has been hailed
as a way to democratize

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
finances for all, not
just for wealthy elites.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:10%
But with the rise
in popularity, what

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:10%
are the potential pitfalls
of these online currencies?

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:10%
Zeus Yiamouyiannis, author
of "Transforming Economy

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:10%
From Corrupted Capitalism
To Connected Communities"

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:10%
has been studying cryptocurrency
and how we use it for years.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
So how does it work?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The impulse to develop this
money started with the desire

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:10%
to decentralize money,
management, and supply.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Blockchain is a way of digitally
sort of marking the development

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and moving around
with this money

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that it
can't be counterfeited.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
They do it in such a
way that it's anonymous,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:90%
it's decentralized, but secure.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Why crypto?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Why change the current
monetary system?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The current monetary
system can be manipulated.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
The supply can manipulated
to benefit very few people

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:90%
over the many.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
As we've been seeing in
the past few decades,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the same pattern keeps
emerging and it's growing.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is greater
and greater gambling

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
by the big boys to the
point where they inherently

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:90%
fail through their greed.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And guess who bails them
out 100% of the time?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
The little guy who
had absolutely nothing

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to do with it.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
When that market crashed
in March of this year,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the top billionaires in
the world gained a trillion

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
from the rebound of the market.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing here is how
through political and economic

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
entanglement and
internationalism,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
money supplies are being
manipulated by the very top.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> How does an online currency
democratize money and society?

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the interesting thing
about cryptocurrency is that it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
exists in sort of the three
traditional ways that we have

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:90%
understanding wealth.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
First, is historic wealth like
gold, an actual commodity.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
The second is an
exchange medium.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing is the
democratization, I think,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of value.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why cryptocurrency
is interesting

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's not open
to manipulation

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.175 align:middle line:90%
in the typical ways.

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So it has the
potential for being

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
very much a democratically
supported monetary system that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:90%
is secure.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What does the future hold for
crypto now that institutional

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
investors are getting
in on the craze?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of institutional
investing in crypto,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.115 align:middle line:90%
it's a mixed bag.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the biggest
hedge fund traders

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.743 align:middle line:84%
out there made a substantial
multi-billion investment.

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:29.035 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- and he said it
with the right mentality--

00:03:29.035 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:84%
he said it's an
investment in the future

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:90%
of the health of humanity.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And to this I
would say, I'd love

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
to see a new
cryptocurrency started

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
which has a maximum limit
of how much you can buy

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is accessible
to everyone.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> We've seen markets rise
and crash sometimes with

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:90%
devastating effects.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
The dotcom burst
in the early 2000s.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The housing market crash and
resulting bailouts in 2008.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
With cryptocurrency
showing such volatility,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is this another bubble
waiting to burst?

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a real problem
with bubbles right now in terms

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
of not only the ability of the
elite to gain access to this,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
but also for the volatility.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
As I said in another
forecast, it's

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
the humanity around
the money that's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
more the problem than
the money itself.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
But that very much is
part of the picture.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have to evolve
as human beings

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we go beyond greed

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and beyond just simply
stores of wealth, and more

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
toward exchange and what I
call going from "thing" value,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
a possession, to use
value, or experience

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:90%
in exchange and community.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Cryptocurrencies have a lot
of hurdles to get over before

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
becoming the democratizing
force some envision.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
But Zeus Yiamouyiannis
sees this as a way

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
to get out of our current
system of monetary manipulation.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Crypto fixes that
manipulation in one very

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:10%
important way.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be
arbitrarily increased.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
The money supply, you
can't just print money.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Getting them, again, another
leveraged unfair advantage.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
with cryptocurrency.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Could cryptocurrency actually
help bring about a spiritual

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:84%
awakening by ending the
elites' control over

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:90%
the world's finances?

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Could we move to a
more equitable society

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
based on mutual trust
and understanding instead

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:90%
of greed and self-service?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:90%
We will see what happens.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:90%
