00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.146 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A historic amendment could
establish a United States

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.650 align:middle line:90%
government office to study UFOs.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:84%
A major development
signifying the government

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:84%
may be ready to treat the
UFO phenomena seriously.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.935 align:middle line:10%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand
has quietly introduced

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:10%
an amendment to the National
Defense Authorization Act

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:10%
for 2022 that if
passed, would radically

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.045 align:middle line:10%
transform the US government's
treatment of UFOs.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:10%


00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope who worked for
the UK's Ministry of Defense

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:10%
investigating refers on the
substance of this amendment.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:10%
>> The main takeaways obviously
are to replace the existing UAP

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:10%
task force with an Anomaly
Surveillance and Resolution

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:10%
Office to loop in almost
every part of the military,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:10%
the intelligence community,
and in terms of accountability

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:10%
to have this
independent watchdog,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:10%
the aerial and transmedia
phenomena advisory committee

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:10%
sitting over a lot of this.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Selecting people from
the Galileo Project,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
from the scientific coalition
for ufology and bodies

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.585 align:middle line:90%
It's unprecedented.

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> A significant development in
this Amendment is the inclusion

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:84%
of civilian scientific experts
specifically mentioning

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
professor Avi Loeb's
Galileo Project.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But the US government
has had a bumpy history

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:90%
with civilian scientists.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:10%
>> What it's trying to do is
blend together the government

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:10%
side of this with the scientific
and academic community side.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think for
many, many years,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
there has been a disconnect.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Government doesn't
do science very well.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Here in the language of
Senator Gillibrand's Amendment,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:10%
we have an attempt to fix
that, to try and bring

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:10%
in scientists, academics,
and loop-in their expertise

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.106 align:middle line:10%
so that it can be
properly leveraged.

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:10%
>> In June of 2021, the
unclassified short version

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.750 align:middle line:10%
of the UAP report left
many wanting more.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:10%
This Amendment calls for
unclassified reports.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:84%
How do they rectify the
government's need for secrecy

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
with the public's desire
for accountability?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There is always this
tension between the classified

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and the unclassified.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we have a 9-page
unclassified summary

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
but by all accounts,
there's a classified version

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:90%
at least double that.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So Senator
Gillibrand's Amendment

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
acknowledges that there will
always be a classified side.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:10%
But also addresses
that important point

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:10%
about public
accountability by saying

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:10%
there must continue
to be reports,

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:10%
but there's a whole raft
of reports required.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I think some annual,
sometimes quarterly.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the 1940s and the
United States' first detonation

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear weapons, there have
been reports of refers visiting

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and even interfering
with nuclear weapons.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:10%
This Amendment includes language
requiring reports on, quote,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:10%
unidentified aerial
phenomena associated

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:10%
with military nuclear
assets, including

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:10%
strategic nuclear weapons
and nuclear-powered ships

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:10%
and submarines, as well as
any health problems associated

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.815 align:middle line:10%
with close contact with UAPs.

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Immense significance of the
material about human effects,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:10%
the physiological effects
of close encounters.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
If a pilot has a close encounter
and comes back and finds

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that his watch is
telling a different time,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
or if he comes
back and finds he's

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
got sunburn and somebody
says, hey, it's not sunburn,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:90%
it's radiation.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, those
statements at which

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:10%
you can see reflected in the
language in the Gillibrand

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:10%
Amendment, what they do,
they acknowledge the reality

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:10%
of this part of the phenomenon.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:84%
If you read between
the lines of it,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
what it's essentially saying
is these things are happening.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the given.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And what they're then saying
is given that these things are

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
happening, UAP interaction
with nuclear weapons,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
close encounters that have
physiological effects,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
we need to find out the whats
and the whys a little bit more.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's extraordinary
by its implication

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.166 align:middle line:10%
of the reality of this.

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Pope started with the
UK Ministry of Defense studying

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
the UFO phenomena in
the summer of 1991.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
30 years later, what can we
learn about how far we've come?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:10%
>> The big picture is that
we have transitioned within

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:10%
government from a
policy of deny, debunk,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:10%
and downplay to a position
where essentially this is real,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:10%
now we need to find out what
the heck's going on, and what

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:10%
our response to it should be.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
With my perspective of 30 years
involvement in this topic,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think we are moving
to a very good place here.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The Gillibrand Amendment
could be taken up by Congress

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:90%
as early as this month.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:10%
