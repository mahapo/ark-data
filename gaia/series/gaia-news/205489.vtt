00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.140 align:middle line:10%
>> People have been using
various forms of energy

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.160 align:middle line:10%
medicine for thousands of
years, yet it has never been

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:10%
rigorously studied as a
scientifically verifiable form

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.370 align:middle line:10%
of healing until now.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.758 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Energy medicine is
based on the idea

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that our physical body is
just a part of what we are.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We also have an energetic
body which can be manipulated

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and channeled to create physical
changes resulting in healing.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
While the anecdotal reports of
the success of these modalities

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
over the ages are
plentiful, energy medicine

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
has always been relegated to
the realm of pseudoscience

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
by the mainstream
scientific community.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Recently, however, the Institute
of Noetic Sciences, or IONS,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
has sought to change that
by conducting a pilot

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
study investigating the effects
of energy medicine treatments

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:90%
on pain reduction.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Garret Yount is a scientist
at the institute, which

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
is focused on applying
scientific methods to studying

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
consciousness and reality.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:10%
He was the lead
author of the study

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
and had this to say
about what motivated it.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The motivation for the study
comes from the fact that a lot

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:10%
of people experience
benefit from energy medicine

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:10%
modalities, but we don't really
understand why or how exactly.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:10%
So the goal of this
pilot study was

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:10%
to set up a controlled
scientific setting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and see if we could bring
energy medicine practitioners

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:10%
into this laboratory
setting and study it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:10%
with the standard
tools of science.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers enlisted
190 participants,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
all of whom suffered from
chronic carpal tunnel pain

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of the wrist, which
significantly interfered with

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:90%
their lives.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:10%
Every participant was treated
in one 30-minute session

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:10%
by one of 17 energy medicine
practitioners who had

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:10%
been selected for the study.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Each of the practitioners
practiced a different energy

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
healing modality ranging from
Reiki to shamanic healing.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The goal of this pilot study
was to assess the feasibility

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
of studying energy medicine
under these rigorous scientific

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So the setting was an
electromagnetically shielded

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
room, so a big metal
box, basically,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
big enough for a couple
of people to get in.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
We set the folks down with pain.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
We hooked them up
with electrodes,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of gizmos in there.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So we had many different types
of energy medicine represented.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to
consider all of this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:84%
together and standardize it, so
we limited the amount of time

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
to 30 minutes with a single
30-minute energy medicine

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the range of
different healing modalities,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
the treatment experience
varied with each practitioner.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
For the intent of this
study, researchers

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
chose not to differentiate
between the modalities,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
rather assessing
them all as one.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.798 align:middle line:84%
>> So the range of types of
treatment were mostly no touch.

00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
There were a few of
the practitioners

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:90%
that did apply light touch.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Most of them were silent.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of the practitioners
did vocalize.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Numerous outcome measures
were taken before, during,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and after each session.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:90%
The results were promising.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So the main outcome of this
study was that pain reduction

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:90%
was achieved.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So these folks did experience
relief from their pain.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the way we
assess that is-- the way

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to test clinically is
a self-rating of pain

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:90%
on a scale from 1 to 10.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So what we found on average was
a two-point drop in that scale,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
both immediately after the
energy medicine session

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and also at the three-week
follow-up point.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
This is considered
clinically significant,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is the kind
of relief that folks

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:84%
would receive from taking
pain meds, for example.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that you'd
have to take that daily.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to
measuring pain relief,

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.860 align:middle line:84%
researchers also looked at
measures of interference with

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
daily life, and all showed
improvement after treatment.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
While these findings
were significant,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Yount sees the greater
implications of this study.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So the goal of the
pilot study was to assess

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the feasibility of bringing
practitioners into this sterile

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And does it work,
and is it feasible?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And so the answer is yes.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We were actually able to
see that energy medicine was

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:90%
effective.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is really
important for future work

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
now that emboldens
scientists to be

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
able to apply their rigorous
standards of science

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:90%
to study this phenomenon.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And the goal of that is to
understand the mechanism of it.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Yount is hopeful that
this study will serve to set

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the stage for future research
to delve into just how energy

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:90%
medicine works.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.805 align:middle line:84%
And that may have even
more far-reaching effects.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say one of the end goals
of this is to level the playing

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
field in terms of how energy
medicine is seen among

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:90%
the other modalities of healing.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that applying
the scientific lens

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
will go a long
way to doing that.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> IONS is already going forward
with further study which many

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
hope will ultimately lead to
energy medicine's integration

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
within the health care system so
as to be available to all those

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:90%
who could benefit from it.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:90%
