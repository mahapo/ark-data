>> As scientists announced the
completion of the human genome

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
map, the emerging science
of epigenetics provides

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
an alternate view on how we
can gain mastery over our genes

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and achieve true well-being.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I am the master of my
genome because I can change

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.950 align:middle line:84%
my thought, my perceptions,
and in the process,

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
I can change my
genetic activity.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:90%

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Lipton is a
cellular biologist and leader

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:10%
in the field of
epigenetics, which

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:10%
holds that external factors
can affect our gene expression.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:10%
Lipton's research
over many decades

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:10%
has suggested that
it's our environment

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:10%
and even more importantly,
how we perceive it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:10%
that determines how
our genes behave.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
>> Less than 1% of disease
is connected to genes.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Over 90% of illnesses
stress, which means

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:10%
you're not living in harmony
with the environment.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:10%
And the function of the cells
is to adjust their biology

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:10%
to the environment.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:10%
But I say, but
wait, the brain is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
the interface between the
environment and the genes.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So my cells don't know what
the real environment is.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
My cells only respond to my
perception of the environment.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:10%
While positive
thoughts can heal you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:10%
of any disease, that's
placebo, negative thinking

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
can cause any disease
irregardless of what genes

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:10%
you have because negative
thinking through epigenetics

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:10%
can rewrite healthy genes
and turn them into cancer.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Creating the good,
but you also have

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
to recognize you're
participating in creating

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:90%
the negative things as well.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest roadblock to
exerting a positive influence

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
over our genes, Dr. Lipton says,
comes from faulty programming.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:84%
>> All of us got programmed the
first seven years of our life.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.220 align:middle line:84%
We play the program
95% of the day.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind,
which is the creator mind

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is separate from the
subconscious mind,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:90%
which is the program mind.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The significance is that
subconscious is autopilot,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
95% of your life is
coming from a subconscious

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
then you were playing programs
and you're not playing creator.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is, the programs
we got in for seven years,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and up to 60% of
those programs are

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
beliefs or things that
are dis-empowering,

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
self-sabotaging,
limiting behaviors.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And therefore we're losing
power in the program that says,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:90%
who do you think you are?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve that?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:90%
You're not that smart.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.640 align:middle line:84%
These are things that we
acquire when we were young.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we get
beyond this programming?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to replace the
programs that operate 95%

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of the day, those programs that
are not supportive of who you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
are because that
means 95% of the day,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
you're playing those programs
and you don't see it.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:90%
But everybody else does.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And the behavior that's
coming out is not yours.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's the one you downloaded.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you rewrote
those programs,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
then the direction of your
life radically changes.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.745 align:middle line:90%
You can create what you want.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Lipton suggests several
specific ways you can rewrite

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.765 align:middle line:84%
the programs of your
subconscious mind.

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The first way is how did I
get the program in the first

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:90%
place?

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
A child in his
first seven years is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in a state of the
theta, which is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
by definition hypnosis,
which is how it downloads

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
the behavior by simply observing
mother, father, siblings,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.023 align:middle line:90%
community, just watching them.

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:90%
How can you change it?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.827 align:middle line:90%
I go, through hypnosis!

00:03:50.827 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Oh, do I have to see
a hypnotherapist?

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I say, nope.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
The moment you fall
asleep, alpha disconnects

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and now you're in the next
lower vibration called theta.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Every night when
you go to bed, you

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.247 align:middle line:84%
put a pair of earphones on, you
play a program of what you want

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to be true in your life, health
program, relationship program,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.885 align:middle line:84%
job program, whatever it that
is the kind of belief you

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
want to operate from.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:84%
First coming through
the earphones,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:84%
it's now going straight
into the subconscious mind.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Dr. Lipton,
other ways of accessing

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious and rewriting
its programs include repeating

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
positive affirmations and
practicing various energy

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:90%
psychology modalities.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
For Dr. Lipton, it's never
been more important to do so.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two things that I
recognize that are fundamental

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
to the evolution as planet.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Number one is the one we just
talked about, epigenetics,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because that takes victim
away from me to say, no,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I am master of this
biology and what it does.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And number two, you are an
internal spirit energy field

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that plays through this body.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Not only can I not die,
but I can create the world

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:90%
that I want.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
victimization

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
falls right out the window.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:10%
