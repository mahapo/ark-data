00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.140 align:middle line:10%
A groundbreaking new
study of lucid dreaming

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.080 align:middle line:10%
suggests that people can
heal psychological trauma

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.070 align:middle line:10%
while they're asleep and may
even show potential for healing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:10%
on the physical level.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:84%
A lucid dream is
a dream in which

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
you're actively aware of the
fact that you're dreaming

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and may even have some
control over what happens.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:84%
While scientists
have been studying

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
this fascinating
phenomenon for decades,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
recently, the research focus
has shifted to the potential

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:90%
for healing within this state.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:10%
Charlie Morley has taught
thousands of people

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:10%
worldwide how to lucid dream.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
He was involved in the most
recent study of lucid dream

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:84%
healing conducted by the
Institute of Noetic Sciences

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
or IONS.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Lucid dreaming is
like being conscious

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:10%
within the unconscious mind.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
So there's a whole host
of healing benefits

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:10%
that we can gain
from lucid dreaming.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:10%
In fact, many of the things you
can treat with hypnotherapy,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.890 align:middle line:10%
you can also treat
through lucid dreaming.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.870 align:middle line:10%
Now there's some very
interesting studies

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:10%
and preliminary
research that points

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:10%
to lucid dreaming being one of
the most powerful interventions

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:10%
for people with
nightmares and especially

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:10%
PTSD-triggered nightmares.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:10%
In the IONS study,
a group of 49 people

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:10%
with diagnosed post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:10%
were given instruction by
Charlie into lucid dreaming.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:10%
Over the course
of one week, they

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:10%
were taught various
induction techniques

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:10%
with a specific emphasis
on making a dream

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.197 align:middle line:10%
plan for healing.

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So the techniques that
we use for this study

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:90%
started with the basics--

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
keeping a dream diary, learning
to check dream science,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
reality checking
during the day, all

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of your classic lucid
dreaming techniques.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But what we've placed
a lot of emphasis on

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
was the dream
plan, planning what

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
you want to do in your
first or next lucid dream.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:84%
If I were to become lucid within
those recurring nightmares,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
what could I actually do
to help affect healing?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered
was that simply

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
by becoming lucid in a
recurring PTSD nightmare

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that already had a healing
response because it's like, oh

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm not really
back in Iraq,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm simply dreaming
I'm back in Iraq.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
But once we trained people
not only to get lucid and know

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're dreaming, but to
then intentionally interact

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
with the source of their fear,
or the source of their trauma,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
or the thing that
they've been running

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
from in their nightmares
to actually turn and face

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
it had a really powerful
healing response.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And we had some really good
data that we gathered from that.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
The data that was
collected consisted

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
of a number of clinical
questionnaires administered

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
before, during, and
after the study.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
These were then
analyzed to determine

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
whether the participants'
PTSD scores had been

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:90%
affected by the experience.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:10%
Doctor Garret Yount, a molecular
neurobiologist at IONS,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:10%
led the study.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:10%
We have 49 dreamers
total and 36 of them

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:10%
had lucid dreams
during the week.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:10%
So that's 73% of them
experiencing the lucid dream

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:10%
during that workshop.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:90%
This is tremendous.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:10%
The headlines, though, are we
have the first data coming out

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:10%
from our primary outcome
measure and that's

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:10%
the PTSD severity scale.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So everybody going into the
study was above a threshold

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
according to this
standardized scale.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And the average
dropped way below

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.057 align:middle line:84%
and it stayed down
for three weeks.

00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's really significant
that this kind

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
of relief from symptoms
would last that long.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Another very impactful
outcome during it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:84%
was all the testimonials from
the dreamers saying things

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
like, my nightmares are gone,
I'm so happy, thank you.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:90%
This is the healing work.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.292 align:middle line:84%
Talking about the
years of psychotherapy

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
they've been through,
they've never

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
been able to have these
kinds of breakthroughs.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
What is it about the
experience that brings

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:90%
about such profound healing?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.175 align:middle line:84%
PTSD is very difficult to treat
with conventional methods.

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
There's something
about the lucid dream

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
where you have access and
also in a very safe way

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
to be able to process trauma
that's very difficult to reach

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
with talk therapy.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Post-traumatic stress disorder
is a disempowering experience.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Training yourself to wake
up within your dreams

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and take control or direction
over the dream state

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most empowering
experiences you can have.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
That in itself, I
think, holds the key

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
to what is lowering
people's PTSD scores when

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:90%
they learn to lucid dream.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
In addition to questionnaires,
researchers also

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
collected saliva samples from a
small subgroup of participants

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to look at the effect on an
important biomarker called

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%
salivary alpha amylase.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Our hypothesis was a
healing lucid dream will

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
have such a powerful effect
on not only the mind,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.510 align:middle line:84%
but the body that
we would expect

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to see a lowering
of inflammation

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in the biomarkers of the saliva
after a healing lucid dream.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the first
study of lucid dreaming

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:90%
and a physiological marker.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is basically
a marker and it

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.800 align:middle line:84%
would be at least one step
into really clear evidence

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that this inner experience
of having a healing

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
inside of a lucid dream
could have physical effect

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
at the body that can be
measured at the body level.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Researchers are still
analyzing those results.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And while they will need to be
repeated with a larger sample

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
group, the findings could
have great implications.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
If we are able to get good
data from this biomarker,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that will open up
the door to look

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
at other physiological markers
and ultimately other types

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of illnesses.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I think, ultimately,
this may really

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be a beautiful
model for studying

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.952 align:middle line:90%
the mind-body connection.

00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:03.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of other ways
that have tried

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to prove the
mind-body connection,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.647 align:middle line:84%
you can say it's kind
of outside influence.

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You could say it's
the placebo effect.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You could say it's to do with
the other people in the study.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
The lucid dream is
a closed circuit.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You're literally
asleep, so the variables

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.362 align:middle line:90%
are incredibly limited.

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you can prove
that the mind affects

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the body through
lucid dreaming, you

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
prove something
quite remarkable.
