>> Archeologists in Israel
have just made a groundbreaking

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920 align:middle line:10%
discovery.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Could the skull they found
belong to a new type of human

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and our oldest relative?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:10%
In recent years, the
regular discovery

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:10%
of new species of archaic
human have been complicating

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:10%
the human family tree.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:84%
The finding in
Israel is the latest

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to fill in missing information
on this ever-changing timeline

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.340 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins is an
ancient history researcher

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.015 align:middle line:10%
who has written
extensively on the topic.

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most important
discoveries in anthropology

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:10%
in recent years has been the
finding of fragments of a human

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:10%
skull at a place named
Nesher Ramla in Israel.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:10%
It's an open air site
that was functional

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:10%
between about 120,000
and 140,000 years ago.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the archeologists that
have been working there

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
have discovered not only
sophisticated stone tools

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
but they found
fragments of this skull.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And this skull is
unique because it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
has elements of an
archaic human that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
looks similar to a Neanderthal,
but also it has human elements.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Israeli archeologists have
deemed the skull as belonging

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:10%
to a new kind of archaic human,
naming it Nesher Ramla after

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:10%
the site where it
was discovered.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.860 align:middle line:10%
Others have expressed doubt
about the classification

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:10%
as a new type of human,
arguing that there

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:10%
was too much interbreeding
between different kinds

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:10%
of archaic humans to do so.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
All agree, however, about
the overarching significance

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.276 align:middle line:90%
of the finding.

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main takeaways of
the Nesher Ramla skull is that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it confirms to us that a form of
proto Homo sapiens were living

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
in what is today Israel,
not just during the age

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of the skull itself, which is
probably about 130,000 years

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
old, but much earlier because
we know that these same people

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
would seem to have been in the
area as early as 400,000 years

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
This is remarkable because if
we look at the conventional idea

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
of human evolution,
the earliest humans

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to have evolved
in Africa between about 200,000

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and 300,000 years ago.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But here, we have evidence
of their existence going back

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:90%
to 400,000 years ago.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:10%
>> If these ancient people
were in fact our oldest human

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.852 align:middle line:10%
relatives, it begs the question,
just who were the Nesher Ramla?

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So what we can say about
the Nesher Ramla people is that

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:10%
these are the earliest people
that had technologies which

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:10%
would eventually be passed
down and become the stuff that

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:10%
creates civilization.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But they also
invented shamanism,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is extraordinary
because we've

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
looked at the Neanderthals as
possibly being the earliest

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
shamans, we've looked
at the Denisovans

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia has been
the early shamans.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it
could have been Nesher.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And this was going
on in the cave

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.130 align:middle line:90%
as early as 300,000 years ago.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And it cannot be coincidence
that these same people suddenly

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
become the most sophisticated
people anywhere in the globe

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Though further
discoveries are sure to come,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:10%
this finding could go a long way
to furthering our understanding

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:10%
of our own origins.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> This is so important to our
understanding of who we are,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:90%
where we came from.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can
unravel this one,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
then we know exactly the
origins of our own civilization.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:10%
