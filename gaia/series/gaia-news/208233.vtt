00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550 align:middle line:10%
- In a first of its kind study,
the psychoactive drug MDMA

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.770 align:middle line:10%
was just shown to
be exceptionally

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:10%
effective in
treating alcoholism,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:10%
offering new hope
for a frustratingly

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.290 align:middle line:10%
difficult to treat condition.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.015 align:middle line:90%

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
- As scientific evidence for
the efficacy of psychedelics

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:10%
in treating mental
health disorders mounts,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:10%
researchers have now turned
to studying the potential

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:10%
for their treatment
of addictions.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Alongside a new study
showing the success

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.160 align:middle line:84%
of the psychedelic ketamine
in dramatically reducing

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
alcoholic relapse,
another study recently

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
examined the use of
MDMA-assisted therapy.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ben Sessa is a psychiatrist
and Chief Medical Officer

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:10%
at Awakn Life Sciences, a
British biotech company that

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:10%
is at the forefront of research,
development, and delivery

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelic medicines.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:10%
The company was involved
in the ketamine study

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.675 align:middle line:10%
and led the MDMA study on
Alcohol Use Disorder, or AUD.

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.140 align:middle line:10%
- Phenyl
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.300 align:middle line:10%
MDMA, is a
phenylethylamine which

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:10%
has mild psychedelic
properties but primarily

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:10%
what we call
entactogenic properties.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a particularly
useful tool for

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.620 align:middle line:90%
trauma-focused psychotherapy.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:10%
It switches off
the amygdala, which

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:10%
is the fear center in the
brain, which allows a patient

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:10%
to reflect upon and recall
painful traumatic memories

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:10%
that they would normally
avoid and suppress.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So this, in many ways,
makes it the Holy Grail

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:90%
for trauma-focused therapy.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've always thought
of AUD as essentially

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
PTSD plus alcohol
in so many cases.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to see-- let's see
if MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:90%
would work for AUD.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
- In the study, participants who
had just completed an alcohol

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
detox program received an
eight-week course of treatment

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
with MDMA in combination
with psychotherapy.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Both researchers
and participants

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.240 align:middle line:90%
were amazed by the results.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:10%
- When we followed that
group up to nine months,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:10%
around 20% of them had
returned to pre-detox levels

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:10%
of drinking.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Relapse to drinking
after getting dry

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.440 align:middle line:84%
is around 80% to
90% at 12 months.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
That's an embarrassingly
poor statistic.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So this difference
between 80% and 20%

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is staggering and
absolutely is far and away

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
above the current gold standard
treatment for alcoholism.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
- The mechanism behind how
MDMA-assisted therapy works is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.916 align:middle line:90%
fascinating.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
- So MDMA works across a
number of different receptors.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
What you get is a reduction
in anxiety and depression,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
increased original
thinking, an arousal zone

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:84%
perfect for psychotherapy,
and high levels

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
of empathy and compassion
for self and others.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And this switching
off of the amygdala

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
makes it so crucial it allows
you to selectively focus

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
upon difficult memories,
but your other faculties

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:90%
are kept intact.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can carry
out psychotherapy

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
during the drug
experience, which

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
allows patients
who had previously

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
been stuck and unable
to move forward

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to talk about these
difficult things

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
that they've been carrying
around since their childhood.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Which then allows
them to understand

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
why they're drinking,
and they no longer

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
need to use alcohol as a
form of self-medication

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:84%
against these
traumatic memories.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
- Researchers like Dr. Sessa are
quite excited about the future

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic therapies and
passionate about the need

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:90%
for further exploration.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
- I think as we go
forward into the future,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
we are going to see all of
these psychedelic drugs,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
whether it's LSD, DMT, ketamine,
MDMA, psilocybin, all of them

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:90%
will eventually become approved.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And they will all be
available for a wide range

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
of mental disorders.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
Because psychedelic
medicine is really

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be the
future of psychiatry.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
The top-down biological model
of the last 40 or 50 years

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
is quite clearly not
solving the problem

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
of the epidemic growing mental
health problems, particularly

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:90%
addictions.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Patients deserve more than
just daily maintenance,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:84%
drugs that paper over the
cracks and keep symptoms at bay.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Patients deserve upfront,
intensive, effective, creative

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
combinations of psychotherapy
and pharmacology

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that allow the patient to get to
the root cause of the problem,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
put it to bed, and get
on with their lives.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And psychedelic
therapies are the most

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
innovative and exciting
forms of medicine

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that's come out of the
last 75 years of research.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's an enormous
privilege and pleasure

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.576 align:middle line:90%
to be part of this movement.
