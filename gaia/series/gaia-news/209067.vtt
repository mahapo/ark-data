00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.320 align:middle line:84%
A new study provides the most
compelling evidence to date

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
on the impressive
mental health benefits

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.980 align:middle line:90%
of microdosing psilocybin.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
While there has been an ever
increasing number of studies

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
showing the efficacy of
treatment of mental health

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
issues with
psychedelics, there has

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
been relatively little research
on the practice of microdosing.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Microdosing, or
repeatedly taking

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
small barely perceptible
amounts of psychedelics,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
has been exponentially
increasing in popularity,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.940 align:middle line:84%
with a wide range
of people reporting

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
a multitude of improvements to
their psychological well-being.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:84%
The latest scientific
study to look

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
at the effects of
microdosing, conducted

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
by researchers at the
University of British Columbia

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and other leaders in the fields
of psychology and mycology,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%
is the largest of its kind.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The study followed
953 people who

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
use small repeated doses of
psilocybin for about 30 days,

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
as well as a control group
who did not micro dose.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
While the exact dosages of
psilocybin that participants

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
self administered
varied somewhat,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
they were all low enough to
not impact daily functioning.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Over a one-month
period, participants

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
took these psilocybin
microdoses 3 to 5 times per week

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and were asked to complete
a number of assessments

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
through a smartphone app that
tracked their mental health

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, mood, and
measures of cognition.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The findings definitively
showed that the microdosing

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.610 align:middle line:84%
participants demonstrated
greater improvements

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
in mood and mental
health than those

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
in the non-microdosing
control group.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:10%
Study author Dr. Zach Walsh
told News Nine, quote,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:10%
"Our findings of
improved mood and reduced

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:10%
symptoms of depression,
anxiety, and stress

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:10%
add to the growing conversation
about the therapeutic potential

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:10%
of microdosing."

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
In addition, as
researchers were also

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
looking to assess
cognitive benefits,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
participants used
a finger tap test

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
to measure their
psychomotor ability, which

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
is the marker for
neurodegenerative disorders,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:90%
such as Parkinson's disease.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:10%
The finding showed improvement
in these abilities especially

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:10%
in those over the age of 55.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Another fascinating
component of this study

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.800 align:middle line:10%
was the investigation
of the use of stacking,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:10%
where psilocybin
mushrooms are combined

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:10%
with other non-psychedelic
substances, such as lion's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:10%
mane mushrooms.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
The study noted that
those who stacked

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
had greater improvements
than those who did not.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:84%
The researchers are very
enthusiastic about the results

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and are adamant about the
need for further investigation

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
in the form of more rigorous
placebo controlled studies.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Walsh stated to
the Vancouver Sun, quote,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
"We have an epidemic of
mental health problems

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:84%
with existing treatments
that don't work for everyone.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:84%
We need to follow
the lead of patients

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
who are taking these initiatives
to improve their well-being

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:90%
and reduce suffering."
