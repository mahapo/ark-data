00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> A new study shows
that training children

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.090 align:middle line:84%
in mindfulness techniques
can dramatically improve

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.900 align:middle line:90%
their sleep.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What's surprising to us
was how much more they slept.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Recent statistics suggest
that we are in the midst

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
of an epidemic of poor sleep,
and children are especially

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:10%
vulnerable to the consequences.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Christina Chick is a
developmental psychologist

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:10%
who recently headed a study
at Stanford University that

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:10%
looked at a
mindfulness-based solution

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:10%
to sleep issues in children.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids, depending on the age,
but between elementary school

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and junior high, should really
be getting 9 to 11 hours

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.630 align:middle line:90%
of sleep per night.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the best data
that we have suggests

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that most kids are getting
on average about 7 hours.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think about that
on average at least two hours

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
loss night after
night after night,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
that adds up to compound
to a significant loss

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of the restorative
functions of sleep.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Research is continually
uncovering the many vital

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
functions that only happen
during sleep and are essential

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
for overall health,
particularly in children.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We think of sleep
as a passive process.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
a very active one.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So when your body goes to
sleep, your brain in many ways

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:90%
goes to work.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so part of that work is
consolidating memories, so all

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of that wonderful learning that
happens during the school day,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:84%
but also social and
emotional memory.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is also when a
lot of growing happens.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
If kids are losing out on, you
know, two hours plus of sleep

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
per night, that
really adds up to--

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
starts to add up to a
disadvantage over time.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The consequences of losing
sleep in childhood can be dire.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the short term,
emotion regulation suffers,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
concentration suffers,
memory suffers.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the long term,
we also see really

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
a host of physical and
mental health risks

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
that come from sustained
insufficient sleep.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Nearly every
psychiatric disorder

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is associated in some
way with altered sleep.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As there is a direct
relationship between stress

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and poor sleep, Dr. Chick and
her colleagues designed a study

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that aimed to teach kids skills
they could use to help regulate

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
their nervous system's
response to stress,

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
ideally improving their sleep.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So we partnered with
a local school district,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:10%
and we delivered a curriculum
during the kids' normal

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:10%
Physical Education or PE class.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And so twice a week for
a period of two years

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
we taught them a
curriculum which

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:90%
was developed by Pure Edge.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
There were yoga inspired
movement exercises.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
There were also
breathing exercises.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers studied
participants' nightly sleep

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
using a method called
polysomnography.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
The findings were
overwhelmingly positive.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> We found that the kids in
the control group decreased

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
their sleep on average
by one hour per night.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, the kids who
received the curriculum

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
actually increased their
sleep by an average

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of over an hour per
night over the two year

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:90%
period of the study.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And so to not only
not lose sleep

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
but gain sleep during this
period was really remarkable.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
By learning to regulate
their nervous system,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
the kids were
putting their bodies

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
into a state that was
more conducive to falling

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
asleep and staying asleep
and getting restorative rest.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Chick is very hopeful
that these findings will lead

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:84%
the way for the widespread
adoption of such school-based

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
She also urges parents
to model and incorporate

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.050 align:middle line:84%
stress reduction techniques,
such as breathing breaks,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:90%
into their daily lives.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So even though we think
of yoga, mindfulness,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
meditation as adult tools, not
only can kids use them but they

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
can do so effectively
and they like it.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:10%
