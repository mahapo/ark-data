The king cobra, a bite can
kill you within 30 minutes.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.630 align:middle line:84%
However, this same
substance has also

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.380 align:middle line:84%
been developed into a drug
that can ease chronic pain,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that even the strongest
synthetic painkillers can't

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:90%
touch.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And today, along with
venoms from an array

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of other creatures, cobra
venom is showing great promise

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
in the fight against a
number of deadly diseases.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
People have used
venoms as medicines

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine,
Ayurveda, homeopathy,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and other traditional
systems of medicine

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
have all recognized
the potency of venoms

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and used them to treat
pain, inflammation,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular
disease, and more.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:10%
Western medicine got involved
in the early 1980s, when

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:10%
the first venom-derived
drug, captopril, was

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:10%
approved by the FDA for
use in hypertension.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Today, there's been a
resurgence of interest

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
amongst researchers and the
pharmaceutical industry owing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to advances in the study
of these compounds.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:10%
The most recent study, out of
Florida Atlantic University,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
shows the potential
of cone snail venom

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:10%
in treating severe malaria.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:10%
Glenn King, a professor
at the University

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:10%
of Queensland in
Australia, has been

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:10%
studying venom for decades.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:10%
He had this to say
about why venoms

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:10%
can make such good medicine.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:10%


00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Venoms are a treasure trove
for biomedical exploration.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:10%
And the reason for that is
they're incredibly complex.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when I first
started working on venoms,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought that each
venom would probably

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:10%
contain a few compounds.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, they
contain hundreds

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to thousands of molecules
in a single venom.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.425 align:middle line:84%
And some of these animals
are incredibly ancient,

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
about it this way.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing
medicinal chemistry

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of million years.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.437 align:middle line:84%
They're a long way ahead of
us in terms of their knowledge

00:02:14.437 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:90%
of how these molecules work.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it possible for
substances that can kill

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:90%
to also heal?

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of them are full
of hundreds or more small

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
peptides.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
them is they're very potent.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:90%
They're highly selective.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Something that can
be lethal to a prey,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
can actually be very
beneficial to you.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And the classic
example is a drug

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
that came out of one of these
venomous marine cone snails.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
When the cone snail
envenomates a fish,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
it's hits an ion channel that's
found of the neuromuscular

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
junctions of the fish.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
paralyzes the fish,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
enables the cone snail to
reel it in and then eat it.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:90%
We have that same channel.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But in us, that
channel is not found

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in our neuromuscular junctions.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It's found in our spinal cord.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's used to relay
pain messages to the brain.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.965 align:middle line:84%
So that same molecule in the
human is actually a painkiller.

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
It's analgesic molecule.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was approved by
the FDA some time ago.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's now used to
treat people who suffer

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:90%
from intractable chronic pain.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>> There are now seven
FDA-approved drugs derived from

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
venomous animals, with many
more in clinical trials.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
One such promising venom
comes from the honeybee.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Naturopathic doctor,
Donese Worden,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:10%
is particularly excited
by these recent studies.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> For thousands of years,
humans have used honey,

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
propolis, and the venom from
these European honeybees,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
that that particular type of
honeybee is being studied.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not in
human studies yet.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
But it is quite--

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
there are quite a
few studies being

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
done in laboratories that are
showing that they are rapidly

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
killing two types of our most
aggressive breast cancer cells.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And critically, is that
those venoms are leaving

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:90%
the healthy cells unharmed.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So beautiful medicine
coming from nature.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Snakes are another source
of potent venom medicine

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and potential treatments
for cardiovascular and other

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
As is spider venom, which Dr.
Glenn King has been focusing on

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.508 align:middle line:90%
in his lab.

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:36.473 align:middle line:84%
>> So spiders for us having
been the most successful of all

00:04:36.473 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
the venomous animals
we looked at.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.383 align:middle line:84%
I think because
they are so complex.

00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the most exciting
discovery we've made

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
recently is we found
a molecule from one

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of those spiders
that's able to protect

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%
the brain after a stroke.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
That would be a breakthrough
in treatments today

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
because there are no
neuroprotective drugs

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:90%
for stroke.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the exciting
subsequent development

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
was that same molecule
protects the heart

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
from myocardial infarctions
after a heart attack.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> This resurgence of interest
in venom is due to several

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
factors.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Dr. King explains.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got the molecular tools
that enable us to dissect out

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
these venoms from these
animals that produce very,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
very tiny amounts of venom.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's just a
much greater diversity

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of animals we can look at.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We've gone from snakes,
to literally hundreds

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
of different species we can
now look at, and dissect,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and determine whether
there's any molecules that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:90%
might be interesting.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So take it from
the dish to the mice.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time for
the human studies.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be on the
forefront of pushing that

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:10%
>> While it may be some time
before the next FDA-approved

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:10%
venom-derived drugs
are made available,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:10%
there is much in this
field to be excited about.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:90%
