00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In spring of 2017,
researchers began a scientific

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
inquiry into the origins of six
three-fingered mummies found

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.220 align:middle line:90%
in Nazca, Peru.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Gaia has been documenting
the long process

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.060 align:middle line:84%
of identifying the mummies as
top Peruvian universities are

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
testing the material to
see exactly what they

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:84%
are, an elaborate hoax or a
species of something else.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Preliminary results
from tests performed

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
on the largest mummy's
hands, cross examined

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
against the rest of the
body revealed no evidence

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to indicate a hoax.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Scientists found the
largest mummy, Maria,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
to be female and carbon dated
her at roughly 1,700 years old.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, journalist
Jaime Maussan, who

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:10%
has been covering this
story since the beginning

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:10%
and is in contact with
the university scientists,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:10%
has news about the mummies.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:10%
>> There are different
universities in Peru who are

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:10%
investigating this
incredible evidence.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And they have found, really,
the proof that this case is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
absolutely real.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I cannot
give you details,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
because the universities are
planning to present a press

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
conference with all
the discoveries.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you that
the metals that were found

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
inside the bodies, it was
not possible to build them

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.080 align:middle line:90%
in more than 1,000 years ago.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And the universities will reveal
what was the purpose of these.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
shocking for many.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And just there, it's a proof
that these creatures were not

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:90%
from these areas.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Where were these metal
implants found on the mummies?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The implants of metal
in their small bodies,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
we found them in the bodies
that are two feet in size,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:90%
60 centimeters.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:90%
And they are in the chest.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We thought that was something
physical that was put there

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:90%
for some health issues.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But no, now the universities
are finding that it's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%
very advanced technology.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But they will release the
information telling you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
what was the purpose of this,
why they were using this,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:90%
for what reason.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And right there is going
to be the smoking gun,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
as you say in the United
States, about the presence

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
of the another the technology
that was close to humans

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
so long ago.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this discovery
fit into the bigger picture,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the human record, and the
search for non-human life?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The human beings are trying
to find extraterrestrial life

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.200 align:middle line:84%
through the James
Webb telescope,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
with the investigation in Mars,
the investigation in the moon,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
probably, in the moon, Europe
or Europa in around Jupiter

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Now we have here the
physical evidence

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that will prove, along with
the release of the information

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon, that these
UFOs come with these creatures

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:90%
which are not from this Earth.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I am very excited, because all
the findings are demonstrating

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:84%
that what Gaia and
ourselves found in 2017

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely real.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
>> The Peruvian universities
plan to hold a live streaming

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.779 align:middle line:84%
press conference in the
coming months where, they say,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
they will spell out all the
details and provide evidence

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.590 align:middle line:90%
of their claims.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:90%
