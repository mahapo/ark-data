00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Using sound to heal is
an ancient tradition

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:90%
found all over the world.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Greeks used sound
to cure mental disorders.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Australian Aborigines reportedly
used the didgeridoo to heal,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:84%
and Tibetan and Himalayan
singing bowls were and still

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
are used for spiritual
healing ceremonies.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
A recent study showed
an hour-long sound bowl

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:10%
meditation reduced
anger, fatigue, anxiety,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:10%
and depression.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:10%
That is great news
for mental health.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:10%
But now, a new study out of
the Royal Melbourne Institute

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
of Technology in Australia
showed physical cellular change

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:10%
using sound waves.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Scientists used
high-frequency sound waves

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to turn stem cells
into bone cells

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
in a medical discipline called
tissue engineering, where

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to rebuild tissue
and bone by helping the body

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The researchers shot sound waves
at tissue cells for 10 minutes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:90%
a day for five days.

This magnified image shows stem
cells turning into bone cells

high-frequency sound waves.

The green shows collagen,
which is produced

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
as they become bone cells.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:10%
Co-lead researcher Professor
Leslie Yeo explained, quote,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:10%
"We can use the sound waves
to apply just the right amount

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:10%
of pressure in the right
places to the stem cells,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:10%
to trigger the change process."

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Professor Yeo and his team have
spent over a decade studying

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
sound waves effects
on different materials

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and have learned to use sound
waves above 10 megahertz.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
In the past, the researchers
point out experiments

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
to turn stem cells
into bone cells

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:84%
were cost-prohibitive
to scale up,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and as cells had to be
harvested from patient's bone

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
marrow, extremely painful.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But in this experiment,
they used multiple types

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
of cells, even fat cells,
that are much easier

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
to extract from a patient.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
They further argue that
since the sound waves created

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in this experiment
were generated

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
by a low-cost
microchip, their process

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
will be quicker, easier,
and less expensive

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
than other methods.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:90%
The next major challenge ahead--

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
scaling the process, so it
can be put into medical use.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:10%
