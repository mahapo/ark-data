00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.840 align:middle line:10%
UFO sightings on
the rise this year.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.950 align:middle line:84%
The US government appears to be
taking disclosures seriously.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And more former
intelligence officers

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.900 align:middle line:90%
speaking out about UFOs.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
It begs the question,
what do we do

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:90%
if extraterrestrials show up?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.635 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News".

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Interest in UFOs and
calls for disclosure

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
has shifted from a fringe
movement to more mainstream.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
For years, ufologists
have demanded

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
full exposure of all
alien contact with humans.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But what should we actually
do if extraterrestrials

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
make themselves known to
us on Earth or in space?

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:10%
That's the question posed by
Harvard professor of science

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Avi Loeb in his latest article
for "Scientific American".

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:10%
Professor Loeb, author of
"Extraterrestrial, The First

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:10%
Sign of Intelligent
Life Beyond Earth",

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:10%
thinks we should be prepared
for an alien arrival.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>> The first thing to ask is
how to communicate with them.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:10%
It involves the language,
how to decode the signals

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:10%
they send in our direction.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And the second is,
of course, the medium

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:90%
by which they communicate.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We are used to sound waves as we
speak or to written documents.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But they might use a different
method of communication.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no international
policy for how to greet alien

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
visitors.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
we should look into?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we do not know how
soon we will have an encounter.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
difficult to come up

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
with a global policy that would
last very long because we might

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
ultimately venture into
space and have sustainable

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.310 align:middle line:90%
bases on the moon, on Mars.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
is to keep in mind

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we're most likely to
meet the piece of equipment,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
piece of technology
before we meet living

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
creatures because the
technological equipment is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
much more likely to
survive long journeys.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:10%
And so I think the
first thing for us to do

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:10%
is space archaeology,
looking for relics

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:10%
of other civilizations that may
have died by now may not exist,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.570 align:middle line:10%
but they left some
relics in space, just

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:10%
like ancient cultures on Earth.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Former CIA director James
Woolsey said we should be

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:10%
friendly to any
creatures if they exist.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:10%
What do you think
about his statement?

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In that sense,
we should be humble.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We should be modest and
try to learn from them.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So if we ever meet
them, we could find out

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
answers to questions that
we currently find puzzling.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
What was there
before the Big Bang?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
What is inside a black hole?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:90%
What is dark matter?

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
How early did life
emerge in the universe?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of questions to
which we don't have answers.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And that would be fascinating
to learn from them.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:10%
We can also learn
from their mistakes

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:10%
if they misbehaved and
had self-inflicted wounds

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:10%
as a result of that.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
We can avoid a similar fate
by getting our act together.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> With all the challenges
facing the world today,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
why should we
invest in searching

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
for extraterrestrials?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the most important
thing for us is to recognize

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:10%
the possibility that
we are not alone,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:10%
and that we might not be the
smartest kid on the block.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
you have to keep your eyes open

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.378 align:middle line:84%
rather than assume that
we are unique and special,

00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
and there is nothing out there.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like closing
yourself off at your home

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and not looking
through the window.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do
that, you would never

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
recognize that you
have neighbors.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:10%
Just like the fact
that philosophers

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:10%
didn't look through the
telescope of Galileo,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:10%
didn't make the sun
go around the Earth.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:90%
They didn't look.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:90%
They remained ignorant.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth continues
to move around the sun.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:10%
Reality doesn't care
whether we ignore it or not.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> How might contact with ETs
affect humanity and society?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Any contact with an advanced
civilization would have a huge

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
impact on our
culture, on society.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of question
that is the most important one

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
for humanity because
it will change

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
our aspirations for space.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It will change our
perspective about our place

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
commonsensical for us

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to assume that we are not
alone, that we are not

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%
the smartest kid on the block.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever
we assume that we

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
have some privileges in the
universe, we were proven wrong.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:84%
My suggestion is let's learn
a lesson from these examples

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and assume that we ourselves
as intelligent beings are not

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
unique and are not necessarily
the most intelligent ones.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are not
privileged in any way.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we should
search for others out there,

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
rather than assume that we
are the only ones around.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The US government's report
on UFO disclosure is due this

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
summer.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see what the
government will make public

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and what remains secret.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But whatever they reveal,
according to Professor Loeb,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
acting like we are the
only intelligent beings

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
in the universe is
a childish exercise.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We should learn from
our past mistakes

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and explore the universe
with wonder and humility.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And keep our eyes and hearts
open to new possibilities.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News".
