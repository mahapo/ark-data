But as artificial intelligence
replaces our human interactions

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
As the world recovers
from record unemployment

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and millions of job
seekers apply for work,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
many employers turn to
artificial intelligence

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to help sort through
the applicants.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing new.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
If you've applied online for a
job in the past 20 years or so,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
your resume was
probably first screened

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
by a computer
looking for keywords.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But in recent years,
some companies

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
have reportedly
taken the next step,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
using artificial intelligence
for the interview.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine sitting down for
your online interview,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but instead of a person on the
other end, it's a computer.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:10%
It asks you questions,
records your answers,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:10%
then analyzes your face,
speech, and word choice

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.960 align:middle line:10%
to see if you move on.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Proponents of the technology say
it takes out the inherent bias

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that people bring
to the equation.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that the pros of the
AI in the job setting is AI can

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:10%
be trained very, very good
to judge a person, facial--

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:10%
facial expressions,
if they may be

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:10%
lying or maybe
slightly dishonest

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:10%
or not telling the truth.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
cons for the AI could

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
be that there may be some issues
with the way that it reads.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Behind the scenes, there
could be parameters inserted

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:84%
into the software,
and those parameters

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
could make the AI susceptible
to race, appearance, gender.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:84%
All those things can be
set-- preset parameters

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
that the AI is feeding off of
as it's making its decisions

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:90%
or it's giving feedback.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of risky
doing that because there's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
no real true oversight.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
It could make some
mistakes, and it

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
could be prone to some
errors that give the end

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:90%
user some false results.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the lack
of human interaction?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Human beings have an
electromagnetic field that they

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:90%
emit from their heart center.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this can project
between eight to 10 feet away

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:90%
from the body.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Human beings literally
will interact and feed off

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of each other's energy and
can detect each other's energy

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
in real science.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's just something that
an AI will not be able to do.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
At least at this point,
AI cannot do that.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when human beings
are interacting and sensing

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
each other's energy, whether
it's high or low, good, bad,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
or indifferent, and we're making
discernments about one another,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
versus an AI that's
going strictly

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:84%
by numeric parameters
that have been preset,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
so all these things could
throw it off slightly.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think human interaction
is a much better choice.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you rather be rejected
by a human or a computer?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that I'd rather
be rejected by a person than

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:90%
a computer.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.923 align:middle line:84%
At least I feel like
I got a good shot,

00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:90%
to be honest with you.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm
talking to a person,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and I can kind of skew my
presentation or my question

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
or my answers to their
questions towards those.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm dealing
with an AI robot,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:90%
it becomes extremely ambiguous.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it becomes
very, very mundane and very,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.268 align:middle line:90%
very zero and one.

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a data--

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I become like a
database to the AI.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the best phrases
a person can hear is,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:90%
"you're hired."

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But better than that
might be, "I love you."

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
matters of the heart,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
can technology help judge
human attractiveness?

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:10%
In a new study out of the
University of Helsinki,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:10%
Finland, scientists attached
electrodes to subjects' heads,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:10%
showed them randomized
AI-created faces, and measured

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:10%
their brain activity.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:10%
By measuring the
subject's brainwaves,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:10%
the AI was able to create the
ideal face that the individual

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:10%
would be attracted to.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:10%
Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:10%
and love is arguably our
deepest, most human emotion.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.080 align:middle line:10%
Should AI have a part in it?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And what could this technology
be used for in the future?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that using computers
to measure attraction is most

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:10%
likely going to be used for
a lot of marketing tactics.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go heavy, heavy,
heavy into marketing and sales.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's kind of--

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
in a weird way, it's kind
of an invasion on privacy.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But scientists that
have been working

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.842 align:middle line:84%
at these companies,
along with marketers,

00:04:56.842 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to put
together software that's

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
going to allow computer
screens or cameras inside

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
of shopping stores
and so forth to detect

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
someone's affection for
something or another person.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And then it's going to
project marketing data

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to that person, based
off of what they

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
feel their emotions are or
what they're attracted to.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The brainwave
study was interesting.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But as our lives move
more online, what

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.510 align:middle line:84%
could be the unintended
consequences from this lack

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:90%
of human connection?

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that when you have
a situation where the world

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
starts moving towards
artificial lovers,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
there's this connection or
disconnection that's going

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to happen where before it
was a heart to heart biofield

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Now it's going to
become more cold.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think it can
open up a person

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of different types
of mental health issues,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.380 align:middle line:84%
like depression, PTSD,
when they realize

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
that this thing
that they're with

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is not exactly what they
thought it was going to be.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting
their input back.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They're not getting that
energy back from it.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a one-way ticket.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Or I do feel that at
least what they're

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
doing with this, trying to sense
somebody's attraction levels,

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
are to target people
that are looking

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
for those alternative things
and also to market things

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
to them as well.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it time to reassess our
relationship with technology?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We're reaching
a fork in the road,

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
where technology can take us to
a golden age or it could take

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
us down a path to
complete darkness.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I do believe it's a fork.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's
any middle ground there.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.807 align:middle line:84%
We actually need
to eventually get

00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
people in positions
of power or people

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.393 align:middle line:84%
that are working at these tech
companies, that are conscious,

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that are aware of-- who
have knowledge of self

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and are aware of themselves
and have self-love and love

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
for others, so that we guide
it in the right path, the path

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
that it should be, helping
us move towards a golden age

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
where we have
extended lifespans.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the path that it
should be going down,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
helping to enhance humanity
instead of detracting humanity.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Although technology has
helped the human condition

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, we must
remember where technology ends

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:90%
and our humanity begins.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:10%
And as Nobel Peace Prize winner
Christian Lous Lange once

wrote, "Technology
is a useful servant

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:10%
but a dangerous master."

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.238 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
