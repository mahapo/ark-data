radio signal from space

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:10%
that scientists have

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.192 align:middle line:84%
What or who is
sending the signal?

>>MARC DANTONIO: It's
these one-time things you

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have detected a
radio signal from somewhere

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:84%
out in deep space some
4,000 light years away.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
The signal pulsed every
18 minutes and 18 seconds

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:90%
every time.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:90%
18 minutes and 18 seconds.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:90%
It did this for three months.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Then, it stopped.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Scientists assume it was a
naturally occurring rotating

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
object, that, like a
lighthouse shining its beacon,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
will send what appears
to be a repeating signal.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:10%
But Natasha Hurley
Walker, whose study

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.920 align:middle line:10%
into this repeating
signal was recently

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:10%
published in the journal
Nature, told Vice, quote,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:10%
"There are no models that
produce such bright radio

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:10%
emission from two
objects in orbit

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:10%
with each other
with such precision,

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:10%
and any that would produce
any kind of radio waves

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:10%
would also produce X-ray
emission, which we don't see."

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Some think this might be coming
from a highly magnetized star

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:90%
called a magnetar.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So what does this all mean?

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia news
contributor Marc Dantonio.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DANTONIO: Maybe
this strange signal

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:10%
is some weird kind of
magnetar that is rotating.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But we're not used to
seeing it rotate 18--

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%
every 18 minutes.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
That means a rather
slow rotation

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:90%
so this is kind of weird.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
It's something that doesn't
match any model that we know.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it takes
us down a new research path

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:10%
to try and figure out just
what it is we're looking at.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: If
this signal is not

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.418 align:middle line:84%
from some type of dead
star, what else could it be?

00:02:07.418 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DANTONIO: There
is a remote chance,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
there's the remote one,
the far remote one,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that it's a techno signature.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:10%
OK, now, what's a
techno signature?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a signature from
something intelligent

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:90%
that's beeping out something.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, repeating bursts
like this, we always

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
err on the side of caution and
say, well the universe rotates.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Everything rotates.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.453 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it could
be something rotating

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and flashing a hot side toward
us that has this signal in it,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:90%
like a hot spot.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So it could either
be something that's

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:84%
a techno signature
that's intelligent,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a naturally
occurring strange kind

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:90%
of exotic star, a magnetar.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Something along those lines.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's really odd.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Where would it come from?

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
What is the origination
of something like this?

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:84%
How does a star like this
form, if it's a star,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
from a supernova?

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:10%
There's really no
models that show us

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:10%
how something like this forms.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So it is really perplexing,
and therefore, really exciting.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: What about
the pulse itself?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Could there be data within
that could be studied?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DANTONIO: The information
inside the pulse

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
is something that would
be interesting to look at.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Was it sending out
something specifically?

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.545 align:middle line:84%
Was it sending a message
saying, they're coming to you,

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
get off your
planet, or whatever.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that that's
something interesting.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that
no one's really

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
looking inside the pulses
to examine the exact nature.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Sure, they are looking at the
signal, what it's doing, right?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But the signal that's
coming is a very--

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
it's not like it's
blowing off the airwaves.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a very faint signal.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:10%
But the strangeness
isn't how it's pulsing.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The strangeness
isn't why it stopped.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And the strangeness
is in the duration.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:90%
This is all new.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
All new.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Every 18 minutes,
it would pulse.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And at 18 minutes 18
seconds kind of a thing.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a very
strange pulsation period.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And as quick as it came.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Eventually it stopped, and
no one knows why it stopped.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: What
does this discovery

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.683 align:middle line:84%
mean for the big picture
future of astronomy?

00:04:29.683 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DANTONIO: But it's
these one-time things you

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:90%
see that are really exciting.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Because they could be--

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
literally we could be on
the cusp of some other kind

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
of discovery.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:10%
Either way, we are.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
We are on the cusp
of another discovery.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Either discovering a
brand new natural object,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
or discovering possibly
that we're not alone.
