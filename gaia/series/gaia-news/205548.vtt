00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
A placebo is defined as an
inert preparation prescribed

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
more for the mental
relief of the patient

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
than for its actual
effect on a disorder.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It has been used in most
modern clinical studies

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to measure the effects
of a drug against what

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:90%
has been deemed no treatment.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
However, starting in
the 1950s, researchers

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
started to see the power of the
placebo in healing the body.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And today, cutting edge
science is showing just how.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:10%
Former organic
chemist David Hamilton

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:10%
has been researching the
placebo effect for years.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
He wrote about it
in his book, "How

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Your Mind Can Heal Your Body."

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:10%
>> Scientists have done quite a
lot of work on how the placebo

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.045 align:middle line:10%
effect works.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:10%
When you receive a
placebo, your brain

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:10%
produces the substances
that it needs

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:10%
to produce to deliver what you
believe is supposed to happen.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
If someone is given
a placebo for pain,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.567 align:middle line:84%
but they believe
it's an actual drug,

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
then it's almost that there's a
little pharmacist in the brain

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
who says, OK, they
believe that they're going

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:90%
to get a reduction in pain.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So how do I meet
that expectation?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So the little pharmacist
in the brain said, OK,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:90%
how do we replicate that?

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well we use our
own painkillers.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They're called
endogenous opiates.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people think
that it's just all in the mind,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
placebo effect, but it's not.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual chemical
change in the brain.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the brain produces

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
what it needs to
produce to deliver

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
what the person believes
is supposed to happen.

>> Dr. Joe Dispenza is a leader
in the field of mind body

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:10%
medicine and author
of the bestseller,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:10%
"You Are the Placebo."

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
He believes the
placebo effect is

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
a true testament of the power
of the mind to impact the body.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:10%
>> That pill represents
a symbol of hope,

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:10%
a symbol of possibility.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And when the person begins
to associate that pill

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
with the thought
of being better,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
they're selecting a new
future subconsciously.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not even aware
that they're doing that.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And if they begin to
combine that clear intention

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, they're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:90%
changing their state of being.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they change
their state of being,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
they're changing the
way they think and feel.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense now, they're
moving their biology

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
from the past
present reality into

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
the future present reality.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Numerous studies, which
have dramatically ramped up

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
in recent years, suggest just
how powerful the placebo effect

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
can be, especially in pain
and mental health conditions.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
In one remarkable
study, researchers

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.840 align:middle line:84%
found that a placebo
worked just as well

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
as a pharmaceutical for
reduction of some Parkinson's

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
symptoms when over the
course of several days,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
the drug was swapped
out for the placebo.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> On day five, the scientists
could swap the drug altogether

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
for a placebo.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.493 align:middle line:84%
And the placebo was just as
potent as the actual drug.

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the scientific
paper the scientist

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:84%
actually said that the placebo
matched the drug in terms

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of its clinical effectiveness.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, people
who got a placebo

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
got exactly the same reduction
in tremors, muscle stiffness,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and activation of
neurons in the brain

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:84%
as those who actually got
a full dose of the drug.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Most research on the placebo
effect has thus far focused

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
on conditions in which the
symptoms are subjective

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
to the patient's perception.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And in these
studies, the placebo

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to
relieve those symptoms.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So in studies placebo
effects tend to be seen mostly

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
in things like pain,
anxiety, fatigue, depression,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:90%
even Parkinson's disease.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking,
placebo effect and studies

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
are more observable
for subjective things.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is stuff that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is processed through
brain chemistry.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> In double blind placebo
studies patients are not told

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:84%
whether they are receiving
a drug or placebo.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ted Kaptchuk of
Harvard Medical School

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:10%
was uncomfortable with
the ethics of this

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:10%
and over the last decade has
been giving people placebos

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:10%
openly.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And remarkably,
study after study

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
has shown that even when
people know they are receiving

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:90%
a placebo they feel better.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:10%
In his most recent study,
Kaptchuk and his colleagues

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:10%
compared the results
of these open label

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:10%
placebos to double blind
placebos in treating

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:10%
the symptoms of
irritable bowel syndrome

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:10%
and found that both
were equally effective.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Just how does this work?

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Open label placebos work
for a couple of reasons.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But the first way
is in these studies

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.672 align:middle line:84%
people are educated a little
bit about the placebo effect.

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're told a
little bit that there's

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:90%
a mind-body connection.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And also told that
these are placebos,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
but some people
are known to have

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
an improvement in their symptoms
due to a mind-body connection.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So what that immediately
does is see some degree of I

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.920 align:middle line:84%
expect perhaps something
could happen from this.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The other reason why the open
label placebo works may be even

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:90%
stronger.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've had a lifetime
of experience of say,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
when I take these two
tablets, open the bottle,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
take them with some water,
the following thing happens.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Either my pain goes away or
my symptoms are relieved.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And then people
have had decades--

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
hundreds if not thousands
of experiences of that.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So that wires into
our brain networks.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The weight of that ingrained
psychological association

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
for most people is far stronger
than your present moment

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
observation that this
is just a placebo.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The broader implications
of placebo research are quite

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:90%
significant.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There's more potential
in the placebo effect.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to expand our
perception of what the placebo

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:90%
effect is.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we could expand it
into more about the mind-body

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
connection, I think it's
possible to tap into deeper

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
systems of the body, not
necessarily through a blind

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.182 align:middle line:90%
placebo being given--

00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:90%
some people get a drug.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Some people get a placebo--

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
but in some kind of way of
training neural networks

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
or training the immune system.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
These kind of
things are possible.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> More studies on placebo are
forthcoming and are expected

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
to continue to highlight our
remarkable powers of thought

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and innate capacities to heal.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps one day the
placebo may actually

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
become the treatment.
