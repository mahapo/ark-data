00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.440 align:middle line:10%
>> A fascinating new study
examines the mysterious

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle line:10%
twilight state between
wakefulness and sleep and finds

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.540 align:middle line:10%
that it can be harnessed for
creativity and problem solving.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Edison, Albert
Einstein, and Salvador Dali,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:10%
amongst others, are all said
to have used a curious napping

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:10%
technique to spark
their creativity

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:10%
and inspire discoveries--

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:10%
holding an object in
their hands while napping.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
They would wake
as the object fell

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and recall the thoughts they
were having at that moment.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:10%
Inspired by these visionaries,
researcher Delphine Ouidette

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and her colleagues at
the Paris Brain Institute

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:10%
conducted a study to
scientifically investigate

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:10%
this phenomenon.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
The researchers
presented participants

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
with mathematical
problems that had

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
a hidden rule which
would allow them

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:90%
to be solved almost instantly.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
They were then given a 20-minute
break during which they

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
were instructed to relax
in a reclined position

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:90%
while holding a bottle.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:10%
If the bottle fell,
they were asked

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:10%
to report what they
had been thinking right

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:10%
before they let go.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:10%
Throughout this break,
subject's physiological activity

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:10%
was recorded to assess
their state of wakefulness.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Then after the break,
the participants

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
were again presented
with the math problems.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:10%
Findings revealed that
those who had dozed off

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:10%
into a semi-lucid state
known as hypnagogia, or N1,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:10%
were three times more likely to
solve the hidden rule as those

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:10%
who had stayed awake and six
times more likely to do so

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:10%
than those who had
slipped into a deeper

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:10%
sleep just a minute later.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
The findings were
less clear in regard

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
to the technique
of dropping objects

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
to keep from deeper sleep
as some participants dropped

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
the bottle after they have
moved onto deeper sleep.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:10%
However, the study did
convincingly show that, quote,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:10%
"There is a creative sweet spot
within the sleep-onset period,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:10%
and hitting it
requires individuals

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:10%
balancing falling asleep
easily against falling asleep

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.920 align:middle line:10%
too deeply."

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It's unclear why this N1
sleep stage boosts creativity.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Ouidette told Live
Science, quote,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.880 align:middle line:84%
"It might create an
ideal state where

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
you have this loose cognition
and weird associations,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to catch
it if you get a good idea."

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:10%
Adam Haar Horowitz
of the MIT lab

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:10%
sees the practical
implications of the study,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:10%
as he told
"Scientific American,"

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:10%
quote, "It's the kind of study
that you can go ahead and try

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:10%
at home yourself.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Grab a metal object,
lie down, focus hard,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and see what kind of eureka
moments you can encounter."

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Ouidette is also very
excited about the potential

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
for practical
applications and hopes

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:84%
future research will
determine if focusing

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:84%
on this rich twilight
state might help solve

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:90%
real-world tasks and problems.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
"We could even
teach people," she

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
reported to
"Scientific American,"

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
"how to reach this
creative state at will."

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So try it for yourself,
and perhaps you too

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
will get to experience
this intriguing potential

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:90%
for creative insight.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:10%
