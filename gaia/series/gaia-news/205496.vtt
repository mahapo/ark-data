in Eastern Africa,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.420 align:middle line:10%
possibly one million years old.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.100 align:middle line:10%
What will this
discovery teach us

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:10%
about our ancient human history?

A recent gold rush
in Eastern Africa

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:10%
has led to open pit mines where
gold hunters have stumbled

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:10%
upon a different kind of
fortune, hundreds of stone

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
tools, including Acheulean
hand axes, cleavers,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:10%
and other tools.

Head of the study,
professor Miroslaw Masojc

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:10%
from the Institute
of Archaeology

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:10%
at the University
of Wraclaw, Poland,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:10%
says the layers of
soil around the tools

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:10%
were at least 700,000 years old.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Some speculate the tools could
be up to one million years old.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
This discovery puts our
ancient ancestor, Homo erectus,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
in this area twice as far
back as previously thought.

Science and history
writer Andrew Collins

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:10%
on the significance
of this discovery.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the important things
that we can take out of these

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:10%
new discoveries is that our
forerunners, Homo erectus,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.280 align:middle line:10%
were much further east than
we'd expected in Africa.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
This takes us to the
edge of that continent.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they
were in the Levant,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:84%
for instance, as early
as 70,000 years ago,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and it could well be that
we had almost a bridge that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
would take us from one
continent into the other now,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's very
important indeed.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We now know that from
this new evidence

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that the move into Asia probably
took place much earlier.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the
stepping stones

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%
that allowed that to happen.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:10%
>> These tools were found in
modern day open pit gold mines.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Some believe many ancient
cultures used gold and minerals

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:90%
for ceremonial purposes.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course,
the question becomes,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
were they themselves interested
in the gold that was being

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
illegally mined from
these locations?

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, the answer
would unquestionably be yes.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
which we can even

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
take on to the next
stage and wonder

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
whether these minerals,
including gold, were

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
used as part of
rituals to achieve

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:90%
altered states of consciousness.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to see these
forerunners of humanity

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
as being even more sensitive
to the magnetic fields

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and the energies
of these minerals

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and that it could well
have been for this reason

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Homo
erectus people were

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.400 align:middle line:84%
drawn to that area
in the first place.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The Acheulean hand axe is
linked to Homo erectus all over

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:10%
the world.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.750 align:middle line:84%
Adding the possibility
of their interest in gold

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
poses another
interesting question.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The very first, the
very oldest example of it,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.540 align:middle line:84%
which was found on the
western shores of Lake Tacoma,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is that they have this
beautiful symmetry.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:10%
Their shape is almost like
some kind of crystalline form,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:10%
and you have to
ask yourself, what

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:10%
was it that allowed our human
brains to suddenly create

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:10%
things like this and
may well have introduced

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:10%
the idea of a connection with
not just the unknown but also

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:10%
non-human intelligences.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:10%
>> This discovery in this
specific location is a huge

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:10%
find, but Andrew Collins thinks
there are bigger implications.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We can infer from these
discoveries is that we now have

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
yet another piece in the
jigsaw because, you know,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
by piecing together this huge
great picture of activity,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
we can tell who reached what
and at what particular date

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and give us a much clearer idea
of where exactly our ancestors

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:90%
reached and what they achieved.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Another clue, another step
closer to solving the mysteries

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:10%
of our ancient past.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:10%
This is just the
latest discovery

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:10%
to rewrite the history books.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in the future we
will be open to new ideas

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:90%
about how we once lived.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
