>> The longest lunar eclipse
of the century is this week.

What can we learn
from the ancients

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.890 align:middle line:10%
about the celestial
transitional event?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:84%
In the early morning
hours of November 19,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
the moon will be
in partial eclipse.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
NASA says the moon will slip
behind the Earth's shadow

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
for about 2 and 1/2 hours,
and weather permitting, quote,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
"A huge swath of the planet will
be able to see at least some

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:90%
of the eclipse."

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The moon, as well as
other celestial bodies,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
has played a big role in the
lives of ancient peoples,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
mystics and shamans.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary, researcher and
author of "Paranormal Planet,"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:10%
on the history and
significance of the eclipse.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:10%
>> In ancient times, eclipses
were always seen as an omen,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:10%
whether it be good or bad.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
As the sun or the moon
becomes shaded over,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing a connection
both of the feminine

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and the masculine
qualities of existence.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, it
was seen as a holy union.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the connection
between the moon and divine

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
feminine energy
throughout history?

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The moon itself has always
been seen as the goddess

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:90%
of the sky.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, all goddesses

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:84%
that were worshipped around the
world in ancient civilizations

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
all had this symbolism
of the moon itself.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What did the ancient people
know about the planets that we

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:90%
should remember now?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In ancient times, Pythagoras,
who was the inventor of a cult

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
that worshipped numbers, came
up with the idea of the music

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:90%
of the spheres.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
This idea that each planet
had its own frequency, kind of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:90%
like a musical scale.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And these eclipses, when they
line up with one another,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:90%
have an effect.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational effect
that then encompasses

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
the entire magnetic field
of the Earth and actually

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:90%
affects biology on this planet.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> For many cultures, the
eclipse is a symbol of change,

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
a time for rejuvenation
and renewal.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
How do we honor the
planets and ourselves

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:90%
during this time of change?

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are many
mysteries of the moon.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, as
they saw these omens,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't realize as they
occurred around the world,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and every ancient civilization
saw that as an omen,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
but I think what we can learn
is that these are moments when

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
we can both respect
and stand in awe

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of the celestial movements
of the planets just even

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system and
just how sacred that is.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
part I think

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is looking inward
and then making

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that cosmic connection that is
representative of an eclipse.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> To best see this eclipse,
NASA says it will begin about

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
2:00 AM on the east Coast of
the United States and 11 PM

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
on the west coast.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.480 align:middle line:10%
