>> Ancient microorganisms
trapped in salt crystals may

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.240 align:middle line:84%
help find proof of life on
mars and new evidence that

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.350 align:middle line:84%
the building blocks of all life
originally came from space.

Salt crystals in
Central Australia

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:10%
hold tiny microorganisms
calculated

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.530 align:middle line:10%
to be 830 million years old.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
A new study looked at
halite salt crystals

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
from the Browne Formation
of Central Australia.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Using light microscopy,
an unintrusive method

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.450 align:middle line:10%
of looking inside
the crystals, they

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:10%
found organic solids and liquids
consistent with the size,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:10%
shape, and color of algae,
fungi, and bacteria.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Microorganisms have been
found before in salt crystals,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
but the methods used to test
them have been destructive.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
This light microscopy method
will preserve the crystals

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:90%
for future study.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Also, previous finds of
microorganisms trapped in salt

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
have been dated at
250 million years old.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:84%
This latest discovery
marks a significant jump

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:90%
in preserved microorganisms.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:10%
But could these ancient
organisms be reanimated?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have not
tried with these samples,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:10%
but in recent history,
some scientists

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:10%
have had success in
reviving microorganisms.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
As co-author Sarah
Schreder-Gomes

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.140 align:middle line:84%
told Live Science, if they were
able to survive 250 million

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
years, why not a few
hundred million years more?

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly a
possibility for the future

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:90%
to try to culture them.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the
biggest takeaway-- this

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
could be the way to
study samples from Mars.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
As the Perseverance
Rover is currently

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
collecting samples of rocks
and soil that will eventually

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
come back to Earth, using this
technique could prove life

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
on Mars--

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
microscopic life
on Mars, but life

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:84%
nonetheless-- without
destroying the samples.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But scientists will have time
to work on the technology,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:84%
as the Mars samples
are not expected to be

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
returned to Earth until 2033.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:10%
Did the essential building
blocks of life on Earth

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:10%
come from space?

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:10%
A new study of meteorites
says that may be true.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Published in "Nature
Communications,"

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the researchers say they have
found all five nucleobases that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
make up DNA and RNA
from meteorite samples.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:10%
Using state-of-the-art
analytical techniques,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:10%
researchers were able to
identify two compounds which

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:10%
have been identified in other
meteorites as well as three new

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:10%
compounds not seen in meteors.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
This gives credence
to the theory

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that major building blocks
of life came from space.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:10%
As study co-author Daniel
Glavin, a NASA astrobiologist,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:10%
told "Chemistry World,"
this study, quote,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:10%
"provides additional
support for the theory

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:10%
that the delivery of
these compounds to Earth

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:10%
by meteorites may
have played a role

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:10%
in the emergence of genetic
functions for early life."

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:84%
This could help prove that
we are all indeed starstuff.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
