>> You know how it is when
you learn new information.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.280 align:middle line:10%
You want to tell
everybody about it,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.110 align:middle line:10%
and you start
essentially becoming

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.050 align:middle line:10%
an evangelist for whatever it
is you've just found out about.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, I've been doing
that for 30 years.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes, you start
seeing the faces in front of you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:10%
either go blank with boredom--

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:10%
they don't understand
what you're talking about,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:10%
and you realize pretty soon that
it's not being received well.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:10%
This is in crude terms, called
casting pearls before swine.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I bring this
up is in the ancient mystery

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.160 align:middle line:10%
traditions, they always
talk about secrecy.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people think
that means conspiracy.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.410 align:middle line:10%
It means something
entirely different.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:10%
It keeps us from
diluting our energies.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:10%
It keeps us from
throwing information

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:10%
about in a careless manner
with those people who are not

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:10%
open to it, which often
allows them to reflect back

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.140 align:middle line:10%
to us their own prejudices
and fears, which then makes

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:10%
us doubt what we're
just now exploring

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:10%
and investing ourselves into.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:10%
This is a very
delicate period of time

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:10%
where new information
is surfacing by the day.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:10%
You do not want to
have what you're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:10%
embracing, what you're pondering
tainted by anybody else's

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.440 align:middle line:10%
negativity.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:10%
So for that reason,
that's what the secrecy

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:10%
is about when it comes to this
new, engaging, even esoteric

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:10%
So instead, wait until you
have an audience that really

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
wants to take on
this information

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:10%
and maybe even come
together in little groups.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
I've always encouraged

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:10%
is when you find like-minded
souls in this time,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:10%
come together, maybe even
watch some of our Gaia videos,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:10%
and start finding
that you do have

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:10%
some compadres to talk with.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:10%
But don't toss it
about carelessly.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:10%
So no matter how juicy,
do everyone a favor.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:10%
Don't waste your time
and energy on deaf ears.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
