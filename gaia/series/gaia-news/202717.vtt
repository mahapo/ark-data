discovery in Mexico that may

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.880 align:middle line:10%
have Atlantean connections.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.130 align:middle line:10%
An incredible discovery in a
remote cave in Central Mexico

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:10%
is effectively rewriting
human history in the Americas.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:10%
In an article published
in the journal,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:10%
"Nature," the researchers
point out that up until now,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:10%
mainstream archeology had
put human colonization

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
of the Americas at
approximately 19,000 BC.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The discovery indicates humans
in central Mexico 11,000 years

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
before that, placing humans in
the Americas 30,000 years ago.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:10%
An international
team of archeologists

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:10%
found nearly 2,000
artifacts in the remote cave

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
in Zacatecas, Central Mexico.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
About a dozen of the artifacts
date back from 30,000

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
BC to 24,000 BC and include
pointed projectile points

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and stone shavings
from tool-making.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:10%
So where did these people
in the cave come from?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary, founder of The
Paranormal Intelligence Agency

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:10%
and author of "Paranormal
Planet" on this new discovery.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
How could ancient Atlantis
play into this discovery?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The archeologists determined
that during a period of its

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:10%
occupation, there was no
evolution in the type of tools

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:10%
being used by the people
for a full 750 generations.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, miraculously, all
of a sudden, a generation

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is born that has much
higher technology.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:10%
And there could have been
a diaspora from Atlantis,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:10%
and it's possible that
these migrants from Atlantis

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:10%
actually jump started,
again, the people's need

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and understanding of technology.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
>> What could this 750
generation pause in technology

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:10%
with a sudden jump
innovation mean?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The same tools that they
were using they used for 750

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
generations, which is
thousands of years,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
without the need to improve
upon those tools or without

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
the ability to do so.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:10%
We have to ask the
question why that is.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:10%
Why were these people stunted
in their evolution of technology

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:10%
when it didn't seem to be
that way in other parts

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:10%
of the world, and
then, all of a sudden,

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:10%
they just become
a different kind

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:10%
of people with high culture.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
It is an interesting anomaly.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> What could be the Atlantean
connection to these people?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe Atlantis existed
for thousands of years before

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
the last Ice Age.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The melting of the last Ice
Age completely wiped it out.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
It appears as though Atlantis
existed back in 19,000 BC.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know is Atlantis
was such a seafaring people

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that they actually made it
to North and South America

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
around the same
time period that we

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:84%
see this jump in cultural
and technological development

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:90%
by these prehistoric people.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> For Jack Cary, this discovery
is extremely important for his

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:84%
research into Atlantis and
Indigenous peoples around

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In my research, it's
extremely important

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to understand where these
different ethnic groups

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:84%
originated because that largely
has to do with their oral

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:90%
histories.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's in many of
these oral histories

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.530 align:middle line:84%
we will find the only
accounts of these people

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
having interacted
with beings who seem

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to have been far more advanced.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>> There were no human
remains, and therefore,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:10%
no DNA found in the cave, but
what are the theories about

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:10%
the shared DNA of
cultures around the world?

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Archeologists believe
that the people who became

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
the Native American tribes
of North America came from

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the same people who became
Chinese and Japanese.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
They are known as the
Melanesian people.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating to me
is that they have

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
found slight Melanesian
genomic traces in some

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Indian tribes
in the Amazon basin.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:10%
But no DNA was recovered
from the site, therefore,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
they cannot determine the true
ethnicity of the people at this

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:10%
time.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:10%
>> The question remains, who
were these people and where did

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:10%
they come from?

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:10%
But one thing is
certain, this discovery

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:10%
means current
archeological theory

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:middle line:10%
about the timing of humans in
the Americas must be thrown out

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:10%
and begs the question,
what else don't we know?

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
What else can we learn
about our ancient origins?

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.860 align:middle line:10%
