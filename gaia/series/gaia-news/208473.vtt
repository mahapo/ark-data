00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Wormholes, invisibility
cloaks, and antigravity.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.700 align:middle line:10%
It's not science fiction.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just some of the exotic
topics the US government was

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.390 align:middle line:90%
researching.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.330 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
A massive document dump by the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
shows some of the wild research
projects the United States

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:10%
government was at least funding
through the Advanced Aerospace

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:10%
Threat Identification
Program, known as AATIP,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:10%
and another,
lesser-known entity,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:10%
called the Advanced Aerospace
Weapons System Application

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:10%
Program, or AAWSAP.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
The Defense Intelligence
Agency has recently

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
released a large
number of documents

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to different news
outlets and individuals

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
who have filed Freedom of
Information Act requests.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Of particular interest,
some 1,600 pages

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
released to Vice News
which spelled out,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
among other things,
some of the, quote,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
"exotic speculative
technologies"--

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
invisibility cloaking,
traversable wormholes,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:84%
star gates, negative
energy, antigravity,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
high-frequency gravitational
wave communications,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and an obviously
never-carried-out proposal

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
to tunnel a hole through the
moon using nuclear explosions.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.260 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from these
newly released documents?

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope worked for the
Uk's Ministry of Defense

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:10%
on the UFO phenomenon.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Here's what we know.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Some of the most
extraordinary topics ever

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:10%
to have been discussed
and considered

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:10%
by the United States
government were

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.833 align:middle line:10%
looked at as part of this work.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
There's no getting
away from that.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
When the DIA wrote to
Congress about this--

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and these letters
and these studies

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:90%
are now in the public domain.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It turned out there were 38
research documents produced.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And they covered the most
extraordinary things--

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
antigravity, invisibility, warp
drive, wormholes, star gates.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
This sort of thing sounds
like science fiction.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
maybe say, well,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
is this legitimate to spend
taxpayers' dollars on?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, my response to
that is, absolutely.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Look, this was a $24
million contract.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:10%
Something like the
Large Hadron Collider

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:10%
or the James Webb Space
Telescope-- these projects

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:10%
cost billions of dollars.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the timing
of releasing a large number

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:90%
of FOIA requests now?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This is speculation, but
I'll throw it out there anyway.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
We have the James Webb
Space Telescope now up.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The first results are going
to be available certainly

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:90%
this year, maybe this summer.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And who knows what it'll find?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if you think
you're going to find something,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
if you think there might
be something out there,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
then get out ahead
of the narrative.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Rather than react to it, start
putting things out there.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Start speculating and saying,
maybe we're not alone.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the other takeaways
from these revelations?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The big development is that
there's a consolidated posting

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
of all the material that's
previously been posted plus new

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:90%
material, too.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time, rather
than part of it leaking out,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
part of it going to a journalist
here or a researcher there,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
there's one single place,
officially verified,

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
where people can get all
this material, old and new.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's now up on the
Defense Intelligence Agency

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
website in their
electronic reading room

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:90%
under the heading AATIP.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> What can we expect next?

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
How will this affect the
future of disclosure?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Congress has
made it very clear.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The time for joking
about this is over.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Senators and
congresspeople are saying,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
no, we need to look at this
seriously, and we want answers.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And if they want
answers, I think

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it's reflective of the fact
that we all want answers, too.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we are
going to get them.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:10%
