>> In a world first, scientists
develop a breakthrough

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.650 align:middle line:84%
treatment which uses light
to kill cancer cells.

This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
We often think of light
as a life giving source.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
photoimmunotherapy,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the use of light to help a
person's own immune system

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to fight cancer, light
can be both a source

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of life for the patient,
and death to cancer cells.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
While this type of
therapy isn't new,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
researchers have
recently announced

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
they have developed a new
form of it, which many believe

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
will be adopted as the
fifth major class of cancer

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
treatment, and possibly
the only viable approach

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
for some of the most
aggressive types of cancer.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:84%
A multidisciplinary team
of European scientists

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
joined forces to design
the new treatment, which

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.250 align:middle line:84%
works by combining a
special fluorescent dye

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
with a cancer-targeting
compound.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Shining light on the
compound forces cancer cells

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
to glow in the dark,
helping surgeons

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to remove more of
the tumors compared

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:90%
with existing techniques.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Then, the surgeon would
shine near-infrared light

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:84%
on the site, switching the
compound into tumor killing

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
mode, and killing off any
remaining cancer cells.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
A trial of this therapy
was done on mice

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
with a particularly aggressive
form of brain cancer called

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
glioblastoma.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:10%
Findings showed that the mice
had clear signs of tumor death

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:10%
in as little as one hour
after exposure to the light.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the treatment also
triggered an immune response

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that could mount a new attack on
the cancer should it come back.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Study leader, Dr.
Gabriela Kramer-Marek

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:84%
told "The Guardian,"
quote, "Brain cancers

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
like glioblastoma
can be hard to treat

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and sadly, there are too few
treatment options for patients.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Surgery is challenging due to
the location of the tumors,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and so new ways
to see tumor cells

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to be removed during surgery,
and to treat residual cancer

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
cells that remain afterwards
could be of great benefit."

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are quite
hopeful that the results

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:84%
will be duplicated when they
study the treatment on humans.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, this
trial has shown a light

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a
long, dark tunnel.
