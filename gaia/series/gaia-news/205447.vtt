00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600 align:middle line:10%
>> New technology may
help scientists discover

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial life on
other planets in just days.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.555 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:10%
Scientists at the
Ohio State University

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:10%
have just announced that by
using the James Webb Space

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:10%
Telescope, scheduled
to launch this fall,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:10%
they may be able to
detect biosignatures

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:10%
on gas dwarf planets.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
These biosignatures,
such as ammonia,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
could be a sign of life.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And with new
technology, they may

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
be able to make this distinction
in as little as 60 hours.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:10%
But what exactly do
they mean by life?

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia News
contributor Marc Dantonio

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:10%
on this announcement.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't mean you
and me, life like us.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:10%
We're advanced forms of life.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about microbial
life at the very, very least--

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:10%
very primitive life.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We're looking for that at Mars.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Mars may have life
beneath the polar caps.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.875 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
the water that's

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:84%
running beneath, say,
the south pole of Mars.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.917 align:middle line:84%
There's a reservoir down
there that could have life.

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, because
we're not there.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:90%
We can't get into that to see.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
If it's advanced
life, well, that's

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
just a real boon to
everybody, you know?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But right now it's
just microbial.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>> What exactly
are biosignatures?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> A biosignature is
just what it sounds like,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
a biological signature of life.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
In our atmosphere,
our biosignatures

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
are methane and oxygen, and
to some extent carbon dioxide.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that
the biosignatures

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:84%
around another planet might
include some more exotic gases,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%
things like ammonia.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Ammonia is a biological
signature as well.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It's in our atmosphere as well,
usually expelled by bacteria.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we can see ammonia in
the atmospheres of gas giant

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:84%
planets around other stars,
then what that kind of fosters

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
is the potential
for there being life

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere of these
larger gas giant planets.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It's been hypothesized that even
here in our solar system, Venus

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of all places
might actually have

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
life floating in the clouds
above the sulfuric acid layers.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
that the JWST, the James Webb

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Space Telescope, can look for.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What's so special about the
much anticipated James Webb

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:90%
Space Telescope?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The James Webb Telescope
is a fascinating instrument,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
because unlike the Hubble it's
going to have several times

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:90%
the mirror size.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's also going
to be taking in light

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:90%
that's in the infrared--

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
so beyond what you can
see with your eyes.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes see a narrow range.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Hubble sees that range.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has some
rudimentary ability

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
to go into the infrared
of course, as well.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But the James Webb
Space Telescope

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
is designed specifically to
look into the infrared realm.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, why wouldn't we
want to go visual?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Because visual only
can tell us so much.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
The infrared can
tell us a lot more.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if we look in the
infrared at a distant planet

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
around another star, we
might be able to detect

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
two molecules that might
indicate that there's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%
oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, that of course, is a
biosignature for life like us.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
For photosynthesis, we
have algae and plankton

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, which
generate oxygen. In fact, they

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
generate the bulk of the
oxygen in our atmosphere.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the other planets,
other worlds with the James

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Webb Space Telescope,
we can look

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
at the spectra of
the atmosphere,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
break the light up, and deduce
what's in the atmosphere.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we can see
signatures of carbon dioxide

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and some other elements,
maybe some ammonia,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
then that tells us whether there
might be significant enough

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.055 align:middle line:84%
amounts to warrant
saying this planet

00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
looks like it might
have microbial life

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:90%
in its atmosphere.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> How is the world of
astronomy reacting to this news?

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> We're very excited.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
In the astronomy world, I
know that other astronomers

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:90%
are very excited about it.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
very, very important.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can't stress enough that
the main goal of the human race

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is to find others out
there like us if we can.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Hey, look, we don't
want to be alone.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.367 align:middle line:90%
This planet is big as well.

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can get
lost on this planet

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and never see another person
for the rest of our lives

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
if we want to.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
On the cosmic scale, we'd like
to know that the universe is

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:90%
not an empty place.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're doing.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Are we alone?

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there life somewhere
out there in the universe?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
We may be on our
way to finding out.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
As Caprice Phillips, one
of the lead researchers

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:84%
on this project, wrote,
quote, "For the first time,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
we have the scientific
knowledge and the technological

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
capabilities to
realistically begin

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to find the answers
to these questions."

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:90%
