00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.750 align:middle line:10%
>> A hunting season for Bigfoot?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.140 align:middle line:10%
One Oklahoma lawmaker
has proposed just that.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.675 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Oklahoma State Representative
Justin Humphrey has filed

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:10%
legislation that would establish
a Bigfoot hunting season

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:10%
in the state.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.780 align:middle line:10%
The bill would work with
Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:10%
Division to establish the dates
of season, licensing, and fees.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Humphreys is also hoping
to establish a $25,000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
bounty for anyone who captures
the creature, adding he doesn't

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
want anyone to kill Bigfoot
but rather the license

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:90%
would specify trapping only.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Humphrey said in a statement,
quote, "Establishing

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
an actual hunting season
and issuing licenses

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:84%
for people who want
to hunt Bigfoot

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:84%
will just draw more people
to our already beautiful part

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
of the state.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It will be a great way for
people to enjoy our area

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:90%
and to have some fun."

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Jim Meyers,
researcher and curator

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:10%
of the Sasquatch Outpost in
Bailey, Colorado, disagrees.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand why he's doing
it to bring tourism in, but I

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:90%
think it's a bad idea.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:10%
One, he says it's not with
the goal to shoot Bigfoot,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:10%
it's the goal to trap them.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't think
that'll ever happen.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:10%
I don't think they'll
ever trap a Bigfoot.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether you say trap
or shoot, if you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.693 align:middle line:84%
say it's a hunting license,
every redneck in Oklahoma

00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
is going to get out
there with his rifle

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:90%
and try and shoot Bigfoot.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that is
there's no other game that you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
can hunt in Oklahoma that
looks like a man like Bigfoot

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
does, and I anticipate
hunters being

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:90%
killed by a mistaken identity.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
The other is I believe
Bigfoot is a type of person,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and I think they're
inviting people

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to kill, basically, a hominid.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you know about them
that makes you think Sasquatch

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:10%
are a type of person?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
>> One, because
of their behavior.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They act like people.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:90%
They don't act like gorillas.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Their intelligence
level is as high as ours

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:90%
or maybe even higher.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
There has been DNA
study done on them

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.560 align:middle line:84%
which proves that
they're a human hybrid.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And every Native American
tribe that I've talked to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
believes that they
are another tribe.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
They're just different
kind of people than we are.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There's evidence that Native
tribes have come in contact

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:90%
with Sasquatch around the world.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:90%
What can we learn from them?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a few examples.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:10%
One, the most notable one being
in northern California, where

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:10%
there's an 8-foot
pictograph in a cave,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:10%
along with a smaller one,
and then a very small one.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And they-- it looks
like a Sasquatch.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
But the Native
Americans, every tribe

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
has their own name
for Sasquatch.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
tradition, oral and otherwise.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:90%
They leave Sasquatch alone.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
They expect Sasquatch
to leave them alone.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:90%
But they're people.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.332 align:middle line:84%
Every name I've ever heard,
Native American name,

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is a name you would
give to people,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
not a name you would
give to animals.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Jim has had at least one
run-in with a Sasquatch.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was 2014 was
the first physical sighting,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
but I'd had other close
encounters before then.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I expect I'll have another
sighting sooner or later,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
just because the longer you
do this, the more likely

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're going
to be recognized by them

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and that they're going
to show themself to you,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
because I tend to go back to
the same places regularly.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And if he came face to
face with a live Sasquatch?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope I would have the
presence of mind to talk to it.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I would want to know if
it would speak back to me

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
or in some way try to
communicate with me, whether it

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:90%
be by sign language.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I would love to learn
some sign language in some

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
of the local Native
American languages,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Navajo, Lakota Sioux, again,
just to see would it--

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
would reply in kind?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Would it sign back
to me or speak to me?

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
What I know I want to do is
not take my eyes off of it,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as you take your
eyes off of it, they're gone.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does Jim think will
happen with the Oklahoma bill?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I predict that the Oklahoma
House of Representatives is

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
going to throw it out because
most of those guys are

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
certainly not going to
believe that Bigfoot is real.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to pass a bill,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, I just don't
see them doing that.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If this hominid creature
has lived for hundreds or even

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years
without being captured,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
doesn't it make sense that
they don't want to be seen?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:10%
Surely, catching a Sasquatch
would be an amazing discovery

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:10%
for science.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:10%
But does that outweigh their
right to be left in peace?

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:84%
One thing is
certain, humans will

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
keep trying to find
the elusive creature.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
But at least one expert thinks
they will never be caught.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:10%
