>> A revealing new study on
human evolution and brain

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.730 align:middle line:10%
development.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.039 align:middle line:84%
Could this lend credence
to the stoned ape

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.320 align:middle line:90%
theory of brain evolution?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.781 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:84%
About 800,000 to 300,000
years ago, the human brain

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
experienced a massive and
accelerated growth spurt.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Scientists have offered
many different explanations

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:10%
for how and why this occurred.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:10%
But a new study out of Boston
Children's Hospital focused

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:10%
on a fast evolving
set of human genome

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:10%
called Human Accelerated
Regions or HARs.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Previous studies have
found about 3,100 HARs

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:90%
during brain development.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
But the team at
Children's Hospital

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
determined one HAR, gene
PPP1R17 could be responsible for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
or play a significant role
in rapid brain development.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Further, they discovered this
works differently in humans

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
than in other animals.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:10%
Ben Stewart, host
of Gaia's Limitless

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:10%
on the significance
of this study.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:10%
>> These regions of the
human DNA may hold some kind

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.167 align:middle line:10%
of an answer at the rapid
explosion of human neocortex.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Because if you think of
it, evolutionarily there's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:10%
not been one creature at
least on planet Earth that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:10%
has been studied that had
any organ increase in size as

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:10%
large and as rapidly
as the human brain did.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely some
unanswered questions there.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure that
these HARs regions are

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
being looked at for
something very unique

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
in the evolution of the brain.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And my own personal
twist on it is

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
this also might
be important when

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
we start looking at
brain machine interfaces

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and how the brain
can potentially

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
cause mutations to
adapt to technological--

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
some kind of technology in
the brain to enhance or evolve

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
the human brain.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How could this new discovery
be related to the stoned ape

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
theory?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a possibility that
the stoned ape theory could

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.418 align:middle line:90%
lead into this.

00:02:20.418 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stoned ape
theory was really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:90%
popularized by Terence McKenna.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you would have
some of our ancient ancestors,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
hominids, that
would be following

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:90%
around bovine creatures, cows.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the cow
patties, in the fields,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.543 align:middle line:84%
they would naturally having
followed these creatures around

00:02:37.543 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of thousands of
years, whatever it might have

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
been, that they
would have started

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
eating the mushrooms, the
psilocybin mushrooms that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:90%
grow naturally in cow patties.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
These experiences, tickling the
language centers of the brain

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and other parts of the
brain, bringing down

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
the rigidity of the
default mode network

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and activating other
communication hubs

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.210 align:middle line:84%
That could actually explain
for the rapid explosion

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:90%
of the human neocortex.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
In this article,
they're saying that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
these human accelerated regions
act differently in humans

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
than they do in primates or
creatures like mice and ferrets

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that they've looked into now.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So potentially, if there is some
connection with the stoned ape

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
theory that psychedelics
or psychotropics helped

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
in the expansion of
the human neocortex

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and made us as at least
psychologically so much

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
different than all the rest
of the creatures on Earth,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
then there may be
something to look at here.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is proven to be true,
what's the big takeaway from

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.255 align:middle line:84%
How does knowing where
we come from help us now?

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we understand
about who we are,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
where we've come from, the more
we can understand what it is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:90%
that we're even doing here.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Is there a purpose?

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Is there a trajectory
for human growth

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
or development or evolution
that we don't even know about?

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So the more we
look into our past,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
paradoxically, and even
spiritually many traditions

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
say that, having a better
route on where we've come from

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
gives us a much more
clear vision as to where

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
we're going as a species.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Where we can go,
not where we think

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
we're going like this
is out of our hands,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.000 align:middle line:84%
but where can we take
what's happening?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
How can we see where we've come
from as a species, what life

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
has always been like, what
it seems to be like now,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and look into the
future of how does

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
the development of the
brain make us unique,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
make us different;
what kind of gifts

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
can we serve the planet
and humanity with?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I think now is
probably the best time for us

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
to really start looking into
what can we do to maybe right

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
some of the wrongs and maybe
heal some of the trauma

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have caused
on the planet?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
This rapid expansion of the
human neocortex is the problem,

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and inherent within that
problem is also the solution.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We've created this mess and also
we're gifted with the ability

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to transcend what
we've done to see how we

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.571 align:middle line:90%
can make it through this alive.

00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:10%
