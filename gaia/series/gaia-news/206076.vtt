00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
Sound has been
used for millennia

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
as a powerful tool
for physical healing

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual awakening.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:10%
Today, new research
into the science

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:10%
of sound as well as
emerging technologies

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
to deliver personalized
sound healing

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:10%
has revolutionized
the ancient practice.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.130 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Jeffrey Thompson is
a renowned sound healer

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:10%
who has over the last
40 years pioneered

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.530 align:middle line:10%
a range of remarkable
discoveries in the field.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He explains how our connection
to sound begins before birth.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:10%
>> My total experience in
the womb and for all of us--

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:10%
baptized by sound and vibration.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:90%
My ears are hearing it.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And the largest sense
organ of my body, my skin,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
is feeling it.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:84%
That's my whole experience
for nine months.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why sound is the
most powerful clinical tool.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:10%
Sound is bigger and more
powerful than all of them.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The mechanism by which sound
brings about physical healing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.150 align:middle line:84%
has been studied for decades
and is continually being refined

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:90%
by new scientific findings.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>> When a cell goes
into a healing response,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:10%
it increases its metabolism and
its intake of food expelling

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:10%
of waste and
rebuilding of tissue.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's raising its energy up.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Sound waves can raise it to
its high as possible potential.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
That is way higher than
the cell can do on its own.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:10%
So we've just created
a super healing state

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:10%
with sound waves, when
they're tuned correctly.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This method stimulates
the brain into entering

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
into a specific state by
utilizing the inherent nature

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of brain waves to synchronize
with an external stimulus such

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:90%
as sound.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The phenomenon of brain wave
entrainment is part of a deeper

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.610 align:middle line:10%
function in the body.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.580 align:middle line:84%
If the master control can time
my body rhythms to the world,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to rhythms that are
already happening,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:90%
then I can save energy.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why my brain waves
will follow an external cue.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Once we understand
this principle,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:10%
we can start to
use that principle

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:10%
to gain control of
your body for healing.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> An integral element of
brain entrainment is the use

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
of binaural beats, which are
two sounds that are slightly out

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:90%
of tune.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The brain, looking to make
sense of the dissonance,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:84%
entrains to the
pulse in between,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
linking brain
hemispheres together.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:84%
In order for this
to work, headphones

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:84%
must be used so
that each ear hears

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:90%
a slightly different sound.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> With binaural beats,
hemispheres do this and come

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
apart--

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:90%
the a-ha bang.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a highly desirable
state that nobody

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:09.650 align:middle line:90%
knows how to get to.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as you use binaural
beats with headphones, bang,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:90%
it's there.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's floating there
for long periods of time.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Thompson has built upon
these principles of acoustic

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.110 align:middle line:84%
physics and added a new
medical monitoring technology

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to develop a sophisticated sound
healing protocol which seeks

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
to awaken what he calls the
internal healing program.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
He begins a
sound-healing session

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
by connecting the patient
to a heart-rate variability

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
monitor, which provides
a complete look

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
at the state of the
patient's nervous system

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:90%
and overall health.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So now we can see the
sympathetic parasympathetic

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
live.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can do an
analysis to find out

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:90%
how it's functioning normally.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
functioning normally,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
my innovation is
being able to return

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:84%
it to balance with precisely
tuned sound frequency.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And you calculate
octaves of that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.858 align:middle line:84%
and identify brain
frequencies and then

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
train your brain waves
to those frequencies

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:90%
so it all synchronizes up.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
I can see your brain
waves go to this place.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I can see that
there's a coherence

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of right-left hemispheres.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
I can see the autonomic
nervous system

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
going into this
special zero stress

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
zone, a prerequisite for waking
up, a prerequisite for healing.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:10%
>> In addition to the use of
the nervous system monitoring

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:10%
and frequency-tuning
technologies, Dr.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Thompson has developed a
unique delivery system using

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:90%
the latest in vibration science.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:10%
I had to make the sound table
split down the middle longways

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:10%
with speakers on
the right and left.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I had to have the right-left
stereo separation, the same way

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:90%
the headphones are.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And the split down the middle
to separate the right and left

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
so they're not
influencing each other

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
is now headphones for the body
so that I could get the neurons

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
for vibration sense processing,
neurons in the brain stem,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing
and have that in sync

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
with these special LED
glasses I put together

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
with little LEDs that are
driven by the sound wave.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So now this eye is
seeing one frequency.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:90%
This is seeing another.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm forcing the
occipital cortex

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to do this and the
auditory cortex

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to do this and the
kinesthetic cortex to do this.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And the more synchronized
up I can make systems,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
the more efficient the
whole system becomes.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There are numerous accounts
of healing resulting from

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
the use of sound technologies,
from listening to binaural

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
beats soundtracks to the
more involved multi-sensory

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
therapies such as
Dr. Thompson's.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And today, emerging new research
on stimulating specific brain

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
waves is showing great
promise in addressing

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
neurological disorders and
bringing about the expansion

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.
