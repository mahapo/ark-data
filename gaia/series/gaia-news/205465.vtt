00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The human heart has
always been seen as the seat

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.030 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness and connection.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Now a groundbreaking new
study has definitively

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:84%
shown that our hearts are in
communication with one another

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:84%
through our connection with
the Earth's magnetic field.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.805 align:middle line:90%

00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The HeartMath Institute is
a world-renowned research

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:84%
organization whose
goal is to help people

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:90%
to reconnect to their hearts.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:84%
At the core of their
work is the understanding

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
that our emotions affect
the physiological activity

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:90%
in our bodies.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And by self-regulating,
we can be

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:90%
the drivers of that activity.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
When we can get the heart to
work together with the brain,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:84%
we can enter into a state
of coherence or alignment

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that dramatically benefits our
mental and physical health.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Rollin McCraty is
the director of research

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:10%
at the HeartMath Institute.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.450 align:middle line:84%
He has been spearheading
the investigation

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.385 align:middle line:84%
into the different kinds
of coherent states.

00:01:08.385 --> 00:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
>> We talk a lot about
coherence here at HeartMath.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:10%
And there's three different
buckets of coherence--

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.632 align:middle line:10%
personal coherence,
and that has to do

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:10%
with the harmony and the
harmonious interaction

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:10%
of our body's internal systems
and our heart and brain.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Social coherence
would be the second.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
That has to do with the
coherence of a group.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The harmonious relationships,
are we getting along

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
with each other?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:84%
How do we clear those
histories and separations?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the third is we
call global coherence.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Now global coherence
is where we're

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
studying the synchronization
and the interconnections,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
the interconnectivity, between
humanity and the earth itself.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's this global
coherence that the HeartMath

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Institute's latest study focused
on as part of their Global

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Coherence Initiative.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:10%
The Institute has developed the
world's only global monitoring

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:10%
system that is
constantly tracking

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:10%
the rhythms and frequencies
in the earth's magnetic field.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Their study comes out
of the understanding

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
tangible connection

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
between the earth's magnetic
field and our hearts

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and brains.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The frequency, when we
measure them here on Earth,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
is a frequency called 0.1 Hz.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason this
is important is

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly the same
frequency as our heart rhythms

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%
when we're in a coherent state.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Now the other magnetic
system that's also important

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
here are called
Schumann resonances.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
These are magnetic
waves that are traveling

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
around the earth
that are trapped

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
between the surface of
the earth and the bottom

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:90%
of the ionosphere.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And if they're the
right frequency

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to fit the geometry
of that cavity,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
they become what
are called globally

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:90%
propagating standing waves.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
That just means they're
everywhere all the time.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the takeaway here

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is we have the basic physics
to understand how our hearts

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and brains are
continually synchronizing

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
with and transferring
energy and information back

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and forth between the
fields of the earth.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a giant
biofeedback system.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> An earlier study by the
Institute sought to examine

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%
just how this works.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:10%
A group of people wore
heart rate variability

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:10%
monitors for five months.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Heart rate variability
is a measurement

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of the coherence in
our nervous system.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Researchers found that when
the frequencies of the earth

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
were more stable,
the participants'

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:84%
hearts synchronized with the
earth and they felt better.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
In a follow-up
study, researchers

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
were surprised by
additional findings.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The big surprise came when we
synchronized the data from this

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
group of people who were spread
across the state of California.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we discovered was
that their heart rhythms

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
were actually synchronized.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they were in sync
with the resonant frequencies

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, it showed a
level of interconnectivity

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
with humans that we
just did not expect

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:90%
to ever see, let alone predict.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This led the Institute to
conduct a much larger study

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to try to verify the remarkable
findings on a global level.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>> All the participants in these
groups around the world did

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
what's called a heart lock in,
which is basically a heart kind

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of focused meditation.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
What we found was
that almost every--

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
over 100 people--

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
became more synchronized
with the earth

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:90%
over the next 24 hours.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
More and more
studies are showing

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that this is a really
good thing for us

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to be in sync, to be in harmony,
with the energetic systems

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:90%
of the earth.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Every time our hearts
beat, we radiate a measurable

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field into
the environment.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Given that, the implications
of this study are major.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> There's several
takeaways from this work.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
One is that when
we're more loving,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we're actually really
broadcasting or radiating love,

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
not only does it have a lot
of health effects for us,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually creating a
heart-to-heart synchronization

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in sync,
not only within ourselves

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
and become more in sync with the
earth and the magnetic fields

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of the earth, these are
actually energy sources for us.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
don't just draw energy

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
from the food we
eat, we actually

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
get it from the
energetic environment.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. McCraty hopes that
these latest findings can serve

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
as a call to action for us all.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Being more motivated to
pause throughout the day and ask

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
yourself, what am I
actually feeding the field?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Am I feeding the field feelings
of frustration, anxiety,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:90%
impatience?

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Because what we feed
the field matters.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Or am I feeding the field
love, kindness, compassion?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of us,
especially together,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
feed the field with more
love and compassion,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that's putting a stronger,
more coherent signal

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
into the whole earth's
field environment.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:90%
That helps others wake up.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It helps them make a shift.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The HeartMath Institute is
now forging ahead with a number

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
of follow-up studies to dive
even deeper into the profound

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
interconnectivity of
humans and the earth.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:10%
