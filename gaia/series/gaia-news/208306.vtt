00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.040 align:middle line:10%
- Spring forward, fall
back could be no more.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150 align:middle line:10%
Daylight Saving Time in
the US could be permanent.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans say they
are tired of moving

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:84%
the clocks twice a year and
we should just pick one.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But did the government
pick the wrong one?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.495 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News Breakdown.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
The United States has a
long and complicated history

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:90%
with Daylight Saving Time.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
You might know it better
as "spring forward."

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
First enacted in 1918 during
World War I as wartime,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
the measure was supposed
to give more daylight

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:90%
during working hours.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Meantime, according to Michael
Downing, the author of "Spring

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Forward--

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:10%
The Annual Madness of Daylight
Saving Time," the Chamber

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:10%
of Commerce also liked it as
workers with more daylight

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:10%
after work were more likely
to stop, shop, and spend money

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:10%
on their way home.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:10%
It was repealed only
to be brought back

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:10%
during World War II, again, more
daylight during working hours.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:10%
Post World War II, there
was a chaotic period

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:10%
where states picked whatever
time standard they wanted.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Until 1966, when
the Uniform Time Act

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
made six months of Standard
Time and six months

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of Daylight Saving Time,
which brings us to today.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
People have different opinions
on Daylight Saving Time,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
but most Americans want
the clock changing gone.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:10%
A 2019 AP poll shows
71% of Americans

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:10%
would like to quit
changing the clocks twice

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:10%
per year versus 28% who want
to keep it the way it is.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the US Senate
has just passed

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
a measure that would again make
Daylight Saving Time permanent.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Some people like sunlight
later in the evening,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
especially in the summer.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But many, including medical
professionals and safety

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
experts, argue that
springing forward

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:90%
is hazardous to your health.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Beth Ann Malow, Professor
of Neurology and Pediatrics

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:10%
at Vanderbilt University
writes in "Science Alert,"

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:10%
"Moving the clocks forward
is not just an inconvenience.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It is a shock to the
human body and nature."

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:84%
She and her co-authors
reviewed evidence

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
linked between Daylight Saving
Time and increased strokes,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
heart attacks, and
teen sleep deprivation.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
She explains that falling
back to Standard Time

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
is quote, "relatively benign."

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But by artificially
moving time forward,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
it messes with our
internal circadian rhythm,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
our internal natural clock.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Also, morning sunlight wakes
us up and improves alertness.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
She continues, "exposure to
light later into the evening

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
delays the brain's
release of melatonin,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
the hormone that
promotes drowsiness.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
This can interfere
with sleep and cause

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
us to sleep less
overall, and the effect

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
can last even after
most people adjust

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
to losing an hour of sleep at
the start of Daylight Saving

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Time."

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
If this isn't enough against
Daylight Saving Time,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
then we should be reminded that
the US tried this in the 1970s.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And it failed.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
President Richard Nixon signed
into law permanent Daylight

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Saving Time.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:90%
At first, it was widely popular.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But its popularity
dropped precipitously

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
after Americans had to deal
with month after month of pitch

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:90%
black mornings.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
It was reversed just
16 months later.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So, now after everything
we have learned

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and everything we know after
100 years of this experiment,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
will we go with natural
circadian Standard Time

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:90%
or Daylight Saving Time?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
The Senate approved the Sunshine
Protection Act unanimously.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:10%
The measure will move to the
House of Representatives,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:10%
where its future is uncertain.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
