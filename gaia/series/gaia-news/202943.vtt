>> A new study on
lucid dreaming.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Which method is best to
induce the dream state?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.010 align:middle line:90%

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
A recent international
lucid dream induction study

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:84%
out of The University
of Adelaide in Australia

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:84%
tested five methods used to
bring about lucid dreaming.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:84%
A lucid dream or a dream
where a person knows

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
they are dreaming while
they are still in the dream

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
could potentially be used to
treat nightmares, anxiety,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and other issues.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Mark Stavish, author
of "Between the Gates,"

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:10%
weighs in on this study.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Five areas of
study were done,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:10%
five methods for
inducing lucid dreaming,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:10%
two of which they found
worked quite well.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:90%
One is the reality testing.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And many people know about this
from the movie "Inception."

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with reality
testing with a spinning top.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
If the top continued to spin,
they knew they were in a dream.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And if this top
stopped spinning,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
they knew they were
in waking reality.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The other method which
they found very useful

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:90%
was across the day.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you're falling
asleep, to state very clearly

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:84%
your intention that
tonight I will dream.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I will know that I am dreaming.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And I will become
awake in my dreams.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Or I will lucidly dream or
something to that effect

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
are variations on the
script, but that's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:90%
the fundamentals of it.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> On a neurological level,
a lucid dream differs from

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
a sleeping dream as
the prefrontal cortex,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
the part of the brain associated
with your sense of self,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:90%
is activated.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:90%
In a sleeping dream, it is not.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Why lucid dream?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
What are the benefits?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The benefits to
lucid dreaming is given

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
in the report, where
that it's very beneficial

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
to problem-solving.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.707 align:middle line:10%
As many people
know, when we dream,

00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:10%
it's essentially our way of
attempting to solve problems

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.387 align:middle line:10%
that occur across the day.

00:02:03.387 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:10%
Very often, though, those dreams
don't have any meaning to us,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:10%
because they simply
don't make any sense.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
When we move into the state
of lucid dreaming, though,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
of course, we are
increasingly awake

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:90%
within our own unconscious.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
That is, that which
is unconscious

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is becoming conscious
and really have

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to wrap your head
around what that means.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
You are becoming aware
of more of the contents

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:84%
of your own mind, so
problem-solving increases.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That means learning
speed increases.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And a great deal
of self-awareness

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:90%
occurs on a faster level.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there evidence of lucid
dreaming helping to heal from

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:90%
trauma?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In the report, they stated
that lucid dreaming helps us

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to recover from a variety of
traumas that people can have,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it be sexual
abuse, or physical abuse,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
or emotional abuse
at different times.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And remember, that is locked
and stored within our memory.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And that memory is
fundamentally unconscious,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
although it does have
its physiological aspects

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our neurology,
but it is right there.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And this gives us an
opportunity to enter into it,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and to engage it,
and to resolve it.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the spiritual
aspect of lucid dreaming

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
for those looking to
expand their consciousness?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When we enter into a
state of lucid dreaming,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:84%
we have that opportunity to
go from our own unconscious

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:90%
into the broader--

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:84%
we can call it
collective unconscious.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
We can call it the godhead.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But we have an
opportunity to reach

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
into a deeper state of really
illumination or spiritual

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:90%
insight.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
This is very
important for anyone

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
who wants to
understand themselves

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and is on a spiritual path.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
This is really the pivot point,
not only the hinge in the door,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:84%
but the cornerstone upon
which everything rests.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Although there are
benefits to lucid dreaming,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Mark Stavish warns not
to get too obsessed.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.553 align:middle line:84%
>> The danger of any practice
is becoming too self-absorbed.

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
There's been many
articles written

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
about that of late in
terms of narcissism

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual practice.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we're talking about
meditations of this nature

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
involving visualization,
auto-hypnosis, lucid dreaming,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the greatest problem
that someone may face

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is being too involved
in a fantasy realm.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
That is, they want to
hurry up and get to sleep,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
because the dream world is a
lot more exciting or better

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:90%
than the physical world.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And you really
have to watch that.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Who could benefit
from lucid dreaming?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, lucid dreaming is a
benefit to anyone and everyone.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Really, I strongly encourage
you to undertake the practice,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.410 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to sleep anyhow.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of it.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You are going to sleep,
so make use of that time.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Really, I encourage
everyone who's

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
watching this to take the time
to learn the basic techniques,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
to practice them.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Give it your best.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Really dedicate yourself to
it for three to six months

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%
of just nightly work.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It only takes a few minutes.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle line:90%
You'll be so glad you did.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
The benefits are
just tremendous.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Through this study, we
learned some techniques may be

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
better than others.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
But the researchers
agree more study

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
into lucid dreaming induction
and lucid dreaming in general

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
is needed.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll be looking out for more
information on this practice.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Until then, sweet dreams.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:10%
