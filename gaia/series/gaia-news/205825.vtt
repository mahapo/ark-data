>> Can an ancient psychedelic
plant medicine change

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.255 align:middle line:10%
one's DNA?

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:07.830 align:middle line:84%
A groundbreaking
new study strongly

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:84%
suggests so, in this second
part of our Gaia News

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Special Investigation.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.895 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
In part one of
this investigation,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
we told you about the compelling
findings of a recent study

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
on the use of ayahuasca
in traditional ceremonies.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:10%
Carlos Tanner is the director
of the Ayahuasca Foundation

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.376 align:middle line:10%
in Peru where the
study took place.

00:00:40.376 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:10%
>> What really
struck me, I think,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
was the depression
that after the retreat,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.910 align:middle line:10%
there was a significant decrease
in the symptoms of depression.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
six months later,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:84%
there was a continuation
of decrease in the symptoms

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
where there was no treatment.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that really
suggested that there

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
was a true transformation,
that people had made

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
not just an improvement
because of the treatment,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
but had made an improvement
that would last.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Another finding made
researchers particularly

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.230 align:middle line:90%
excited.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Simon Ruffel is a
psychiatrist who led the study.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Most interesting in this
study was the fact that we were

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:90%
looking at epigenetic changes.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the study of looking
at how the environment causes

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
changes to gene expression.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
In order to assess this,
we collected saliva samples

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
from participants immediately
before drinking ayahuasca

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.842 align:middle line:84%
and immediately
after that retreat.

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
first study that's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
ever looked at
epigenetic changes

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
in any psychedelic
including ayahuasca.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers found a
statistically significant

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
change in the expression
of the SIGMAR1 gene,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
which is thought to be involved
with how traumatic memories are

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.185 align:middle line:90%
recalled.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We can't draw solid
conclusions from this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
because the sample group
was relatively small.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
But it does suggest
that we should

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
be looking more at
epigenetic changes

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.098 align:middle line:84%
as a result of ayahuasca, and
it's exciting nonetheless.

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm pleased to say that we
have got more funding that's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.402 align:middle line:84%
going to allow us to continue
to look at this in the future.

00:02:20.402 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> What makes these
findings so important?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This is potentially
significant because instead

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
of just changing the way that
we're thinking about things,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
it could be altering the way
that our DNA is expressed,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and having a real change on a
biological level rather than

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
just on a psychological level.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What I feel happens in terms
of that transformation that I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
often use as a description of
people's experiences is that

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:90%
their truths are changed.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But ayahuasca, through
that expanded awareness,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
allows us to change or transform
truths, especially the ones

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:90%
that are detrimental to us.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you change
a truth, there

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
is a biological and
physiological transformation

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that goes along with it
or is directed by it.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, if I were to
look at the epigenetic results

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
of the study, I would
look at the transformation

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of personal truth
first, and then

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
the genetic expression
changing as a result

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
of the consciousness shift.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how ayahuasca brings
about this profound shift has

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
been the focus of
study for decades.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:10%
There are many
proposed explanations,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:10%
from the biochemical
to the mystical.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:10%
>> What is really
unique to ayahuasca,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:10%
although also present in
other psychedelic medicines,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:10%
is its ability to amplify
sensory perceptive ability.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the normal
limitations of our biology,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
which we can easily reference
by the term visible spectrum,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
which refers to only the light
spectrum that we can see,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca expands those
spectrums of sensory perception

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to allow for a
greater awareness.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, we
have an expansion

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and access to a
greater source of information

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that we can then process to
gain more insights into what's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
going on inside of ourselves,
as well as outside of ourselves,

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to make more accurate
decisions about how to proceed

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.196 align:middle line:90%
towards our well-being.

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Those involved with the use
of ayahuasca in traditional

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
settings stressed the importance
of the deeply-rooted tradition

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.896 align:middle line:90%
of the medicine.

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
things to remember in this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
study is that ayahuasca is not
the substance that makes this

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
happen, not the way that we look
at antidepressant medication

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.550 align:middle line:84%
or a pharmaceutical product in
the way that those are tested.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
What is being tested in
this study is the tradition.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the ideology and
methodology, the ceremony.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the ingestion of
ayahuasca is a part of that,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
but it is the entire
process that was

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
able to produce those results.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Given that other psychedelics
like psilocybin and MDMA are

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:10%
now at the forefront
of clinical study,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:10%
could ayahuasca one day also
be studied in a lab setting?

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Where does ayahuasca
fit into this?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
difficult question.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Ayahuasca is quite complex.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Can it be used in a lab setting?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Can it be used in
a hospital setting?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:84%
When you lose
things, if you're not

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
using it in a
shamanic tradition,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.430 align:middle line:84%
these are questions that
we're trying to answer.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to look
at ayahuasca more and lab

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
settings, and also trying
to use some influences

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.948 align:middle line:90%
of indigenous knowledge.

00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
or not ayahuasca

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to be used in
mainstream Western medicine,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it will be used
more in independent

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
in private practices,
almost like the way

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:90%
that acupuncture is.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Only time will tell.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But either way, it's
exciting and it's

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
an exciting time for
ayahuasca and the potential

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.141 align:middle line:90%
that it holds.

00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether or not ayahuasca
could or should be studied

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in a clinical setting will
continue to be debated.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But given just how healing
this medicine has proven to be,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
all in the field agree that
further research is necessary

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and could reveal
a deep connection

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:90%
to our own essential nature.
