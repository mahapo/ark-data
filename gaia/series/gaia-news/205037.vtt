00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea of life on Mars
has long captured imaginations

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.520 align:middle line:10%
of people around the world.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we may be closer than ever
to finding out whether life

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.290 align:middle line:90%
might have once existed there.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:84%
February 18, 2021, a trip which
began 203 days prior culminates

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
in a tense seven-minute
final descent,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
as the Rover "Perseverance"
makes its way

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of
the Red Planet,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
landing in Jezero Crater,
the most challenging

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Martian terrain ever
targeted for landing.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The most advanced
Rover NASA has ever

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
sent to another world is
the essential component

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
of an unprecedented attempt to
find signs of microbial life

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which is why
"Perseverance" was landed

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
on an ancient lakebed and river
delta, where it will collect

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
rock and sediment
samples to be sent back

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:90%
to Earth for analysis.

Robert Zubrin,
aerospace engineer,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.785 align:middle line:10%
author, and founder of the
Mars Society, on the mission.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%


00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The "Perseverance"
is carrying three things

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:10%
of extraordinary interest.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
One is a microscope to look
for fossils of microbes on Mars

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.885 align:middle line:84%
to help begin the
process of discovering

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:90%
if we're alone in the universe.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
The second is an experiment
in making rocket fuel

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, which is what is
necessary to send humans

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.490 align:middle line:90%
to Mars.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:90%
And the third is a helicopter.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
The Rovers we've
sent to Mars so far--

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
they crawl along the ground.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
They can do a couple of
hundred yards in a day.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
A helicopter could do a couple
hundred kilometers in a day.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:84%
If this works, it's going
to increase our exploration

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:90%
capability a thousand-fold.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What will it mean
if "Perseverance"

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:90%
finds fossils in Jezero Crater?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
>> If we find fossils
on the surface,

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that's a pretty good bet
there's life underground.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And that means we should
send humans to Mars

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and really find out the truth
about the potential prevalence

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and diversity of
life in the universe.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
>> "Perseverance" is the third
aircraft to land on Mars within

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:90%
the month of February.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Just a few weeks earlier, craft
from China and the United Arab

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Emirates arrived on
the planet, beginning

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
what scientists hope could
be a new wave of exploration.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
These countries all took
advantage of a limited time

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
period, which happens
every few years when

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Mars is closest to Earth.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:84%
While the pace of Mars
exploration has just picked up,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
NASA has been sending spacecraft
to the planet for decades.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And some say evidence
for past life on Mars

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
has been around
for a lot longer.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:10%
George Haas, Mars researcher and
author of "The Cydonia Codex,"

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:10%
explains.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:10%
>> And through all of our
research over 20 years,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:10%
we found overwhelming
evidence of structures.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
There are cities in
the Cydonia area,

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the Elysium area, and
also in Utopia area.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:10%
The current "Perseverance"
Rover that is going to Mars

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:10%
is not landing in
any of the areas that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:10%
have these so-called cities,
like the Cydonia area and some

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:10%
of the areas in Elysium that
has the Raptor Zone Complex.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The Rovers are going
nowhere near these areas.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite the different
theories out there,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
all researchers have high
hopes for the future of Mars

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:90%
exploration.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The most imminent is getting
humans to the planet.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're going to
be on Mars within 10 years.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And as we are talking
right now, Elon Musk

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is preparing another test
flight of his Starship, which

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
is a reusable heavy-lift rocket
that about the same capability

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
as the Saturn V moon
rocket we went to the moon

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
in, except that that
was a throwaway rocket.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a reusable rocket, so
it can get the same payload

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
to orbit as the Saturn
V, but at 1% the cost.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And with that as our
tool, humans to Mars

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to become
an imminent reality.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I think that if
"Perseverance" finds fossils

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:84%
of life on Mars, that's
going to greatly up

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
the interested in sending
human explorers there.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
If Starship,
succeeds that's going

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to make it possible to
send human explorers there.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably
also, well before 2030,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
if ingenuity succeeds, send
some big helicopters to Mars

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and start really exploring Mars
in a way these Rovers can't

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:90%
possibly do.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the first
unmanned starship

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:90%
will land on Mars around 2028.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll have robots that can
walk around like people.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll be machines in the same
sense that "Perseverance" is,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
but they will have
the kind of mobility

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that a person or
perhaps a dog has.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
You could deliver 100
of these robots to Mars

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:90%
and have them build a base.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2030, we
send the astronauts.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And all they got to do is bring
a credit card and check in.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this then lead
to colonizing Mars?

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:10%
Robert Zubrin has been
pushing for this for years.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We go to Mars, we're
talking about the first step

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
in becoming a multi-planet
spacefaring species.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:84%
200 years from now, there
will be new nations on Mars--

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
new nations with new
languages and literatures

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and traditions and
ideas of government

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and social organization--
because that's

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about here.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
fundamental transformation

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of humanity from
a single planet to a spacefaring

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:90%
species.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is something grand.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you have in your power
to do something truly grand,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:90%
then you should.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> As the latest Mars
missions progress,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
the world waits to see if they
will yield definitive answers

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to one of the most profound
questions in modern science.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
