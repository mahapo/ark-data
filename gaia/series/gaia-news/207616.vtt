about something at a distance?

And if it turns out that it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.015 align:middle line:90%

00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Water, the most plentiful
substance on Earth,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:84%
has been shown to have the
unique property of recording

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and storing information.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, it
has recently been

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:84%
used as a target in
the scientific study

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:90%
of mind-matter interactions.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Dean Radin is the Chief
scientist at the Institute

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:10%
of Noetic Sciences, or IONS,
which has for the last 50 years

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
been at the
forefront of studying

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:10%
the frontiers of consciousness.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Since 2006, Dr. Radin
has led several studies

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
on the effect of
mental intention

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
on water, culminating with a
groundbreaking, just-published

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
experiment.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:10%
>> We're interested in
mind-matter interactions where

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:10%
water is the target because we
are composed mostly of water.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:10%
One of the questions,
then, when it

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:10%
comes to any kind
of psychic healing,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:10%
distant healing,
energy medicine,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:10%
maybe the reason why it
works is because the mind

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:10%
can influence
properties of water,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:10%
because then it would
obviously influence all of us.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:10%
So some years ago,
we did studies

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:10%
to look at the claims of
Dr. Emoto, who became famous

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:10%
as a result of putting different
kinds of mental intentions

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.950 align:middle line:10%
into water and then making
little frozen crystals.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:10%
And his claim was that if
you think beautiful thoughts

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:10%
at the water and you
make the crystals,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:10%
the crystals will
look beautiful.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And if you think ugly
thoughts, then you

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:10%
get ugly-looking crystals.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> When IONS conducted two
rigorous studies to validate

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emoto's work, the scientists
found that the effect held.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The quality of the attention
placed on the water

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
directly affected the
configuration of the crystals.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
In another more recent
study, Dr. Radin and his team

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
explored the effect
of intention on water

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.447 align:middle line:84%
as part of an experiment
looking at energy healing.

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We were looking at different
kinds of energy medicine

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
practitioners, and then
almost 200 clients,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
each of which had
carpal tunnel syndrome.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:10%
Each person then would be
treated by one of the healers,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:10%
and we were also taking water
as a proxy for the body.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:10%
And the way that we did
it, we took an aliquot

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:10%
of water, a couple of
millimeters of water,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:10%
and put it around a
necklace that the healer

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:10%
would wear during the healing.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:10%
And then we gave the
same to the client.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So before all of
that happened we

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.260 align:middle line:84%
took a few drops from
each aliquot and did

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
a spectrograph
analysis, which tells us

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
about the molecular bonding
in the water itself.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they did the half an
hour of healing, took the water

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and did it again.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have pre-healing,
post-healing structure

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:90%
of water comparison.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What researchers
found was extraordinary.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what we found on that
was quite strong evidence that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
the water around the
healer's neck had changed,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and it changed in a place
where we kind of expected it

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to change, which is called
the stretching bond.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
There's something about not
necessarily mental intention

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
towards the water,
because in the case

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of healing the patient, yes,
they were wearing the necklace,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
but the healer wasn't
thinking about the water.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
They were just engaged in a
highly focused mental activity,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and that was apparently
sufficient to change that water

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:90%
in the way that we saw.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what are the
implications of these results?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Clinical study looking
at energy medicine,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:10%
the most important thing was,
is there clinical relevance.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So the measure there is,
was the pain reduced.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So the answer was, yes,
very significant statistical

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
difference and even
clinical significance.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
We took a number of other
measures, water measures,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.345 align:middle line:84%
magnetic field measures,
random number generators,

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was something
that could be detected

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:90%
in the environment itself.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:10%
All of that together,
especially the clinical outcome,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:10%
suggests that whatever it is
that energy healers are doing,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:10%
it not only affects the patient
but it affects something

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:10%
in the environment,
and it affects it

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:10%
in an objectively measured way.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>> IONS' most recent
experiment looked at the effect

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
of intentionally treated water
on the growth of stem cells.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
The results have the potential
to change everything.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the implications is
that wherever stem cells are

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
being used, you want to train
the people who are growing

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the stem cells to maintain a
certain intention that these

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
cells are going to grow better,
and then see what happens.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
If it worked, well, that
would change everything,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
because now it means
that anybody doing

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
any kind of mental preparation,
not just STEM cells,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but anything, if they come
at it with an intention

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that this is going
to work better, well,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:90%
it looks like it'll work better.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
