00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%
First observed in 2007, this
phenomenon, called a Fast Radio

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:10%
Burst or FRB, lasts only
a fraction of a second,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:10%
but puts out massive
amounts of energy,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:10%
and some put out
repeated signals.

Marc Dantonio, astronomer
and "Gaia News" contributor,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:10%
on this phenomenon.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:10%
>> These fast radio bursts
are what they sound like,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
radio bursts, that is, down
in the long wavelength end

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:10%
of the spectrum, the
red end of the spectrum,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:10%
light you can't see.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And they happen in just
a few milliseconds.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But we usually see
them from galaxies

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that are billions
of light-years away,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
which implies they
have a massive strength

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to get here with the kind
of intensity that they do.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:90%
So that was a mystery.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:90%
And then we theorized about--

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and I should say,
astrophysicists

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:84%
theorized about--
stars like the pulsar,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.680 align:middle line:84%
which is a neutron star, but
far more highly magnetic.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.895 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
these stars have

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
these massive magnetic
fields, and they

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
have this rarefied
atmosphere that

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
includes electricity
and magnetic fields

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and then the surface
of the star itself.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And under certain
conditions, those stars

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
could emit, basically,
like a shockwave pulse,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
a resonant pulse
that is like waves.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You push waves in a pool,
and eventually one of them

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to get
really, really big.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, that really, really
big wave is a resonant wave.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that
they all add together.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that happens
with these magnetars,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
as they're called,
these gigantic, highly

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:90%
magnetized neutron stars.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And they send out this
very, very rapid pulse--

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.094 align:middle line:90%
pow!

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> How does a star of that
type recharge and fire again

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
so quickly?

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, it takes some time for
a neutron star of that type

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
to recharge and be able to make
another one of these bursts.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:10%
But this particular
one, OK, just

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:10%
when you think you
understand everything,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:10%
OK, this particular one
shows us that we don't quite

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:10%
understand everything, because
this particular magnetar,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:10%
if it's a magnetar at all,
is firing bursts very quickly

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.594 align:middle line:10%
and rapidly, faster than
theoretically possible.

00:02:53.594 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So now we don't know
what's going on here.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Now we don't have an idea.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
What's causing it to
charge up again so quickly?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
To be able to do this--
it's like a flashbulb,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
like a flash when you,
like, on your camera, OK?

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, when
people had flashes,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
when you set off the flash,
you would hear [VOCALIZING]..

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You would hear it
charging up again.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Then you can fire the flash
maybe 10, 15 seconds later.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about that
in terms of a star.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:90%
A magnetar burst goes off.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Pew!

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.310 align:middle line:84%
It sends out this burst
that is massive, so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
massive that it would dwarf
the output of our sun, OK?

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And then it sends up another
one right in short succession.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
the mystery here.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that exciting?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
really exciting.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that these
fast radio bursts that fire

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
in rapid succession with more
power than the sun are some

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
type of signal from
another life force?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be arrogance to say
that it is definitely not life

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:90%

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
That'd be arrogance.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that pulsars,
when we first saw them,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.272 align:middle line:84%
were thought to be
intelligent signals as well.

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
they were neutron stars.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
They had that
lighthouse beacons.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Could FRBs be a
natural phenomenon?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they could, and
maybe they are, OK?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:90%
The chances are that they are.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But I can't deny that these
FRBs, they act a certain way.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you find one
that doesn't, and that's

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:90%
pretty perplexing.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty perplexing.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And that really
opens up the mind

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.135 align:middle line:90%
to think of the possibilities.

00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, hmm, what could
be causing that?

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%

takeaway from what we've

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.448 align:middle line:90%
learned about FRBs so far?

00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%

is that we don't know.

But you know what?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.413 align:middle line:90%
That's actually the fun part.

00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it keeps you
digging through the research.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.955 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you
looking at the data,

00:05:01.955 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure
out what exactly it

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:90%
is we're looking at here.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But then again, on the
other side of this,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there thinking, hmm,
I wonder if it is artificial.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But we can't deny
the possibility

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that there might be other
things at play here.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But we always,
always, always have

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to exhaust all the natural
phenomena possibilities first.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But I like the
possibility that's

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
out there that might suggest
they could be a signal.
