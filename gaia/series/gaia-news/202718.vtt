00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.750 align:middle line:10%
>> A 1,000-year-old surprise
found in a farmer's field,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:10%
and a glimpse into a spiritually
transformational time

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:10%
in our human past.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.184 align:middle line:90%

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:10%
According to the
Archeology News Network,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:10%
local farmer Leonard Larson
was plowing his field

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:10%
in southern Sweden when he
hit a massive flat stone.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.740 align:middle line:10%
When he was able
to flip it over,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:10%
he was surprised to find it
was actually a 1,000-year-old

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
impeccably preserved runestone.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.290 align:middle line:10%
Runes, at the most
essential level,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:10%
was the written form of the
proto Norse, an old Norse

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.260 align:middle line:10%
language which
the Vikings spoke.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:10%
A runestone was often erected
to honor a dead relative.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Kaedrich Olsen, author of
"Runes For Transformation,"

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.860 align:middle line:10%
explains the significance.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a very common type
of stone that is referring

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:10%
to the law of Odal, where,
when the father dies,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:10%
the son raises a stone
in honor of his father,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:10%
not only to commemorate
the passing,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:10%
but the stone is placed
in a very prominent place

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:10%
for passersby to go through so
that going to that land to talk

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:10%
to the father.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They know that now
the father is dead

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and the son has
inherited those lands,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and now they need to
go talk with the son.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Local rune expert Magnus
Kallstrom inspected the stone

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:10%
and determined it to be
from around the first half

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:10%
of the 11th century.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:10%
The stone features a carving
along the edge showing

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:10%
a serpent biting its
own tail and a cross.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>> We find the image of a
serpent eating its tail,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:10%
which is found on a number
of other rune stones,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:10%
and it is reminiscent of
the tales of Jormungandr,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:10%
the great world serpent who
was so large that he encircles

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Midgard or Earth and
eats his own tail.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to Western
esotericism of the Ouroboros

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
as a symbol for infinity
or the infinite mysteries.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Also, interestingly
enough, on this stone,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:84%
we find the cross,
which tells us

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that this stone comes
from a time period

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:84%
where we had the pagan
symbolism of Jormungandr

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and the cross of Christianity.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So this was appealing to
both sides of the coin

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:90%
at the time period.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The stone also
has an inscription,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:10%
which translated
to English, reads,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:10%
"Gardar erected this stone
after Sigdjarv, his father,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Ogard's husband."

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So the inscription that
we find on this stone,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
we have [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And what that is telling
us is that Gardar, the son,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:10%
raised the stone for
his father, Sigdjarv.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:10%
But what's fascinating
about this stone

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:10%
is not only the
name of Ogard, which

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:10%
is the first time we've ever
heard that name on a stone,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:10%
but that it has the iconography
of Christian and pagan motifs.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.840 align:middle line:10%
And when we have families
that are divided,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:10%
that one side is heathen,
the other side is Christian,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:10%
we're going to find some
of these overlapping motifs

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:10%
to appeal to the pagan side and
to appeal to the Christian side

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.258 align:middle line:10%
so that the person is
not, basically, ostracized

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:10%
from either side of the family.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating
about this stone

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
is we see those pagan
and Christian motifs

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
probably appealing to both
sides of Sigdjarv's family,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It is a rare find.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And what this is just further
confirmation of a time

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
when pagan and
Christian beliefs did

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
coincide, the same
time, the same place,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:90%
even within the same family.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It was a dismal necessarily mean
that they got along amicably,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
but it does mean that
there was an attempt

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
to appeal to both of
these religious traditions

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
in some way that the family
could eventually get along,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:84%
even if it is for
this one agreement.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The stone will be cleaned
up and preserved for future

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:10%
generations.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:10%
To those who think history
has already been written,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:10%
we keep unearthing new artifacts
that challenge the mainstream

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
narrative and offer a
glimpse into belief systems

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:10%
and how they merge together.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:10%
What will we find next?

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And what else will
we learn about

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:10%
our collective human past?

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:90%
That remains to be seen.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:10%
