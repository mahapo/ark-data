>> The search for
extraterrestrials in space

continues.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, a new theory.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Could rogue planets
be used as spacecraft

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.050 align:middle line:90%
by alien hitchhikers?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Free-floating rogue planets
are interstellar objects

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
with planetary mass that are
not gravitationally bound

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to a star.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Scientists predict there could
be billions of free floating

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
rogue planets in space.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:84%
With this in mind,
Irina Romanovskaya,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
a professor of physics and
astronomy at Houston Community

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
College just published a
new study proposing aliens

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
could hitch a ride on
these rogue planets.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Writing in her paper,
quote, "I propose

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrial
civilizations may also

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
use free-floating planets as
interstellar transportation

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
to reach, explore, and colonize
other planetary systems.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I discuss how extraterrestrial
civilizations may travel

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
from their home worlds
to free-floating planets

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they may transfer
their free-floating planets

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
to other planetary systems."

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:10%
And as Romanovskaya wrote in
an email to vice.com, quote,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:10%
"Some advanced extraterrestrial
civilizations, if they exist,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:10%
might hitch a ride on
free-floating planets, which

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:10%
is why I call such hypothetical
civilizations Cosmic

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:10%
Hitchhikers."

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers
have claimed the moon

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:90%
could be a rogue planet.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
This new theory may give
credence to that idea.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:10%
So is this suggestion
so far-fetched

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:10%
or could it be possible?

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:10%

UK's ministry of defense

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.040 align:middle line:10%
covering UFOs.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:10%
>> This might use rogue
planets as a means to travel,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:10%
they might hitch
a ride, why not?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think one
can't help but think back

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to the whole mystery
of 'Oumuamua which

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Professor Avi Loeb at
Harvard thinks is artificial.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Does that tie in with the thing
being postulated in this paper?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of a
planet but if it's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
being used by
extraterrestrials would they

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
add on something
to it, would they

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.764 align:middle line:84%
slap a propulsion
system on it or just

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
drift through the cosmos
on an interstellar object?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating speculation
and food for thought.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Romanovskaya also gave
advice on how to find them.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
She argues, a technologically
advanced civilization

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
would leave technosignatures
such as infrared

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and electromagnetic radiation or
low frequency radio emissions.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And an alien civilization who
colonized one planetary system

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.180 align:middle line:84%
would use some of the same
tactics to colonize more.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, quote,
"Wide orbit exoplanets

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
should be searched
for extraterrestrial

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
technosignatures or artifacts."

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So far, this paper
has been received

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:90%
as an interesting theory.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Time will tell if the powers
that be will take her advice

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and look at rogue planets for
extraterrestrial hitchhikers.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:90%
