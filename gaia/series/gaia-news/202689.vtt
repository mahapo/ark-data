could lead to dementia

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:84%
A groundbreaking study out
of University College London

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
suggests repetitive
negative thinking, or RNT,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
could lead to dementia
and Alzheimer's disease

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:90%
later in life.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The study included 292 healthy
adults aged 55 and older.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
the two-year study,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
participants graded
how they typically

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
thought about
negative experiences,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
including rumination
about the past

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and worry about the future.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Some participants
received brain scans

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
measuring the level
of the proteins that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
cause Alzheimer's when
they build up in the brain.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:90%
The results?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
People who had higher
levels of negative thinking

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
did show indicators of
Alzheimer's dementia.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:10%
Ilene Naomi Rusk,
neurobehavioral consultant,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:10%
explains the significance.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:10%
>> The study particularly
showed that beta amyloid

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:10%
and phosphorylated tau,
two proteins specifically

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:10%
associated with Alzheimer's
disease, build up in the brain.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
direct relationship

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
between repeated
negative thinking

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and the buildup of these
depositions of tau and amyloid.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is this happening?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:90%
What is happening in the brain?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:10%
>> To be honest with
you, we don't really know

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.790 align:middle line:10%
what's happening in the brain,
in terms of why repetitive

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:10%
negative thinking produces
changes in the brain.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the speculations is
repetitive negative thinking

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%
is associated with stress.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
When we have changes
in blood pressure

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and the health of the heart
and other physiologic systems,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
then we are automatically having
changes in the brain, as well.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> If we recognize repetitive
negative thoughts in ourselves,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:90%
how can we stop it?

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, this is a cure and
treatment for repeated negative

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:90%
repetitive negative thinking.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Social engagement,
connecting with other people

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
is a data-driven way to delay
the likelihood that you'll

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:90%
get cognitive decline.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And even if you have cognitive
decline, it's protective.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
creativity, I think exercise.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Clean air.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Clean water.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Clean food.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And this staying
connected to other people

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:90%
in a warm and loving way.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:10%
>> For Dr. Darren Weissman,
developer of the Lifeline

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:10%
Technique and author of
"The Power of Infinite Love

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:10%
and Gratitude," there
is a deeper, perhaps,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:10%
even more spiritual process to
stop the negative thought loop.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, when people are
creating change on a deep

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:10%
level, there's a process.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And the process is ways to get
present, first and foremost,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
our power comes from.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
We can use the power
of our imagination

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to begin to shift the chemistry
of our mind and therefore,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
our heart, our
brain, and our body.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a process in
shifting these reactive patterns

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
on a deeper level that create
a sustainable deep change.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> If you are worried you
are experiencing brain health

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
problems, Dr. Ilene Naomi
Rusk has some advice.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, I
trust my patients.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I trust anyone who says to me
I'm having thinking problems.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm having memory problems.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So the important thing to
do is not to ignore it.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It's actually to go to your
doctor, go to a neurologist,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
go to a neuropsychologist
and get some testing.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So make no assumptions if
you have memory problems

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.320 align:middle line:90%
and get help.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> For Darren Weissman,
this study and the effects

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of Alzheimer's
are very personal.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> My father had
horrible Alzheimer's.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a brutal situation.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was wild because the
Father's Day before he died,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I took him and my
youngest son fishing.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up and
my dad was there

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
in this way that was
just so extraordinary.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Where someone is
in their passion.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
That's a doorway that we
can open beyond the pill,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
through learning how to
go deep into the heart.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> A new tool in the
fight against dementia

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and Alzheimer's could be the
ability to recognize and stop

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
repetitive negative thoughts
that could hurt you in the long

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
run.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
As scientific studies
keep progressing,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
we might find that
the simple tool could

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:90%
be just the tip of the iceberg.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But for now, the message
seems to be clear.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
That the cure lies
within all of us.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.380 align:middle line:10%
