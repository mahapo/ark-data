00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.760 align:middle line:10%
>> A new study on longevity
says humans could live up to 150

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.840 align:middle line:10%
years old.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But does the science
back up this claim?

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Our expert weighs in
and shares what he says

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is the right way to
do your own research.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.213 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
A recent study by Singapore
based biotech firm GERO

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
examined the changes
in blood cell counts

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and number of steps taken by
test subjects in the US, UK,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:90%
and Russia.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:84%
By studying these
variables, they

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
found that people did not
steadily decline as they aged,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
but their resilience, or
ability to bounce back

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
from illness and injury
stepped down over time.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And barring disease
or accidents,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
the maximum lifespan
would be 150 years old

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:84%
when the body's capacity for
resilience will be exhausted.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
Bill Andrews, president
and CEO of Sierra Sciences

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:10%
has studied anti-aging and
telomeres for 30 years.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
He is skeptical
about this new claim.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:10%
>> There has been at
least five publications,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:10%
and oftentimes when I speak
at conferences I'll show those

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:10%
publications in the last 25
years that have done a much

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:10%
better job of narrowing it down.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And they have all come down
to somewhere between 120

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%
and 125 years.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this new study that's
come out that claims 150

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:84%
isn't actually saying that
they've extended it out

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:90%
from 125 to 150.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Just the accuracy
of their data is not

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to
give narrow answers.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.637 align:middle line:10%
And when they
contacted the press

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:10%
to make this press
release about their study

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:10%
they focused on the 150.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:10%
>> If this is much
ado about nothing,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:10%
why do stories like this
one make so many headlines?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the stories get
published because the authors

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of studies decided to
get some attention.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So some scientists
would do a study.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They will make press releases
because they want attention.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And the news agencies
pick them up.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And the news agencies
don't know any better.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
They think, well, this must
be some exciting, big, new

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the real
scientific community

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
usually laughs it off
because oftentimes it's

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
just repeating studies that
were done 20, 25 years earlier.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And the authors didn't
even know about it.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They've exaggerated their data.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes they can't
reproduce their data.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So I always discourage
people from actually

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
relying on news
stories, as opposed

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to going to like a scientific
database on scientific peer

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:90%
reviewed literature.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people practice
conclusion hunting,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
cherry picking information
from the internet to make

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
a hypothesis correct.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:84%
How can the layman
do real research?

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not easy.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so one, you have to
learn statistical theory.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to
do critical data analysis.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:90%
You have to have common sense.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to
read a paper, a study,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
a scientific study, and
be able to understand when

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
the scientists
themselves don't know

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.670 align:middle line:90%
what they're talking about.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But you also have to know
how to look at the data

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that they publish
and make sense of it.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so statistical theory
helps out a lot there,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
because just a tremendous
number of top scientists

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
statistics well enough

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and totally misinterpret what
like p equals 0.05 means.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:84%
There's so many flaws in
the scientific community

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
that you really, in
order to know it,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
you have to learn
this stuff yourself.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Going to something like
PubMed, P-U-B-M-E-D,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:84%
which is the government database
of scientific peer reviewed

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
publications is the best
source of information.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Definitely not the news.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Definitely not the
tabloids or social media.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Many researchers and
scientists will send you

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:90%
their studies for free.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:90%
All it takes is an email.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When people contact me for
papers I just don't even think

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.507 align:middle line:90%
I just don't hesitate.

00:04:27.507 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I just instantly send
it without even trying

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:90%
to find out who they are.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- and I think
most scientists are like that.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They want to get their
papers out there.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Meantime, Bill Andrews
believes telomere lengthening

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:90%
is key to fighting aging.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
A telomere is the end of
a chromosome that protects

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:90%
your chromosomes from damage.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
When a cell divides,
the telomeres shorten.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you have the perfect
genetics and lead the perfect

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle, you still have a
theoretical maximum lifespan

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
of 125.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Lengthening telomeres is, I
think, the only way that we

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
can break that threshold.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Lengthening telomeres is
going to be something that's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:90%
absolutely essential to do.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
But it might not be
the only thing to do.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And we won't know until we
actually lengthen telomeres.

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists around the world
are researching the effects

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
of telomere lengthening
to fight aging.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Bill Andrews says
right now funding

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing getting
in the way of testing

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:90%
telomere lengthening in humans.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But in our lifetime, we could
see humans live and thrive

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:90%
well over 100 years old.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:10%
