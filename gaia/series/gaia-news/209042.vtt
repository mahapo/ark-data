>> The spectacular first images
from the James Webb Space

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Telescope are finally here,
and they do not disappoint.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.440 align:middle line:90%
What this means for the future.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:10%
After years of planning,
construction, and delays,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and a cost of about
10 billion US dollars,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:10%
we finally have the first
images from the James Webb Space

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
Telescope.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Launched in December
of 2021, the JWST

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is the largest and most
powerful space telescope ever

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:90%
to be put in space.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
Astronomers have
waited a lifetime

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:10%
to see with such amazing
clarity deep into space.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:10%
James Webb does
this by operating

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:10%
in the infrared spectrum.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:10%
It sees light that is
outside the visible spectrum

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
of our naked eye and of previous
telescopes like the Hubble.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:10%
NASA released photos of
the first five targets

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:10%
noting, quote, "These first
images from the world's largest

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:10%
and most powerful
space telescope

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:10%
demonstrate Webb
at its full power,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:10%
ready to begin its mission to
unfold the infrared universe".

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:10%
Here to break down the photos,
astronomer and "Gaia News"

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:10%
contributor Marc
Dantonio who we caught up

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.586 align:middle line:10%
with on the road in Arizona.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw these images and
the release of all these five

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:10%
different images represent a
different aspect of what this

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:10%
telescope can do.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely astonishing to me.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
From galaxies to gas
clouds, this telescope hands

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
down has the ability
to show us so

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:90%
much that we don't understand.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Most laypeople are
impressed by the images,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:90%
but what does an astronomer see?

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:90%
What should we be looking for?

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at
that large-scale shot,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
the deep field shot that the
James Webb Space Telescope

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.830 align:middle line:84%
took, that image encompasses
a whole bunch of things.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
You see a whole bunch
happening there.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
In one case, you see galaxies
that look like they have--

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
they're stretched and curved.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
That is called
gravitational lensing,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing the
result of a galaxy cluster

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that's in the foreground
warping the images of galaxies

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Those red galaxies on the
outside, those galaxies

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.250 align:middle line:84%
are literally 13.6
billion years old.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
These were formed just after
the very Big Bang itself.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
cool, I should say.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It's filling in the gaps.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been able to
see back that far with any

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:90%
of our instrumentation.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
see back that far,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
it really means the galaxies are
so far away and moving so fast

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
away from us that
their light has all

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
shifted into the far infrared
where none of our telescopes

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.366 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
penetrate until now.

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> How will this help in the
search for extraterrestrial

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.898 align:middle line:84%
>> This telescope is going
to help us with the search

00:03:03.898 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
for life when it starts looking
at exoplanet atmospheres.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, it looked at the
WASP planet atmosphere,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:10%
and they could see chemical
traces in the atmospheres.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
extremely important,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
because right now
up to this point

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
we have not been able to
really accurately look

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
at atmospheres of planets
around other stars.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Now we have that
capability, and this

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
is going to herald in an
era of potentially finding

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
another Earth-like planet
with an oxygenated atmosphere.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What does this latest
discovery mean for the future

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
of astronomy, space
exploration, and even humanity?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You look at the James Webb
Space Telescope and the data

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
they're pulling in, and in a
sense all of these projects

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:84%
embody the human need to
find answers and that's what

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.640 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
We're hunting down answers
to whether we're alone

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in the universe and
we're trying to solve

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:90%
mysteries of the universe.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Webb's first
five images have already

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.416 align:middle line:84%
started to solve a huge
number of mysteries.

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:15.170 align:middle line:10%
