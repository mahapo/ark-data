00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Both solar and
lunar eclipses hold

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:90%
strong energy in astrology.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
They can shake us up
and stimulate change

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves to
reach our highest power.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
We will soon see a partial solar
eclipse and a lunar eclipse.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.244 align:middle line:84%
What can we expect from
these cosmic events?

Astrologer Mercedes
Arnus Arraut.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Eclipses take place
when we have lunar events,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.570 align:middle line:10%
which are full
moons or new moons,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:10%
that fall close
to the nodal axis.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:10%
So what is the nodal axis?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.610 align:middle line:10%
The nodal axis is the
axis of intersection

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:10%
between the orbit of
the moon around Earth

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:10%
and the orbit of
Earth around the sun.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:10%
That axis of intersection
has a north and a south,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:10%
and those points
are called "nodes."

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:10%
So the north node represents
our destiny, our future,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.850 align:middle line:10%
where we're headed as humanity.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.500 align:middle line:90%
What is our destination?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:90%
What is our direction?

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Where do we need to focus on?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
In the south, the south
point, the south node

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
represents our past,
what we need to purge,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
what we need to cleanse,
what we need to integrate,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:90%
what we need to let go.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The first eclipse
will be on April 30,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:10%
but Mercedes says we will
feel it a lot sooner.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> We usually feel it.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We start feeling it
like around a month

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
before the first
eclipse takes place.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:10%
So this first eclipse that
takes place the 30th of April

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:10%
brings many, many
changes into our lives

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:10%
since all eclipses are like
catalysts that align us

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:10%
with our highest purpose.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Whatever is not
aligned in our lives,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:10%
eclipses literally will
cleanse, will detox,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:10%
will be used as tools to
show us what path to do we

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:10%
need to follow.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Soon after the solar eclipse,
we will see a lunar eclipse

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:90%
in May.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
How does this relate to the
solar eclipse we just had?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We can expect
endings, closures,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
cleansings to situation that we
need it to detox of our lives.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So Scorpio is already the
energy of emotional detox,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:90%
of power, empowerment.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:10%
So we can be feeling
very emotional close

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:10%
to this eclipse,
but it's also going

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:10%
to give us the power
to move forward

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:10%
with those changes
we're already starting

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:10%
with the previous eclipse.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's very normal to be
experiencing resistance

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to let go of certain
situations with this eclipse.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:10%
But we can definitely
see a lot of endings

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of closing
times for people

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:10%
to walk out of our lives and
people to walk into our lives

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:10%
as well, especially with
the previous eclipse.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How should we prepare
mentally and physically

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:90%
for these changes?

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Many people are going to
experience death and rebirth

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:10%
from their own ashes as new
beings creating literally brand

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:10%
new lives for themselves, moving
towards a much more practical,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:10%
much more positive, much
more growing reality.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:10%
But in order for
that to happen, we

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:10%
need to let go of what
no longer serve us.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we look forward
to and take advantage of this

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:90%
eclipse season?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Overall, we can use this
eclipse season to focus

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:10%
on building a new reality for
us, focus on enjoying Earth,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:10%
enjoying the pleasures
of being conscious,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.220 align:middle line:10%
of being a conscious human
being appreciating what makes us

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:10%
happy, letting go of whatever
brings suffering or letting go

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:10%
and cleansing that
emotional baggage.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what the cosmic
energy is guiding us towards,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to take care of what we
value the most and let

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.930 align:middle line:84%
go of all the intensity
and what is no longer

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:90%
necessary within in our lives.
