>> A recent study sheds light on
the remarkable case of a woman

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.660 align:middle line:84%
who grew up without a key part
of her brain and was barely

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:90%
affected by it.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:10%
>> In the endless search
to understand the workings

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:10%
of the human mind, scientists
take special interest in cases

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
of the most unique brains.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The most recent
and fascinating is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
that of a woman known
by her initials EG.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Now in her 50s, EG first
learned that her brain

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
was atypical in her 20s
when she had it scanned

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:90%
for an unrelated reason.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
She was told then that
she had been missing

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
her left temporal lobe from
infancy, most likely the result

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:90%
of an early stroke.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
This part of the
brain is thought

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to be involved with language
processing, which makes

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:90%
EG's story so extraordinary.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Despite being repeatedly
told by doctors

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that she should
have major cognitive

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
deficits and
neurological issues,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
EG has a graduate degree, has
enjoyed an impressive career,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and speaks Russian
as a second language.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.700 align:middle line:10%
Several years ago, EG met
Dr. Evelina Fedorenko,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:10%
a cognitive neuroscientist
at MIT who studies language.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Fedorenko was immediately
fascinated by EG's case

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and conducted a number of
studies, the first of which

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
was recently published in the
Journal "Neuropsychologia."

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
As part of the study, EG
took a vocabulary test

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and scored in the
98th percentile.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:10%
Brain imaging revealed
that in the absence

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
of EG's left temporal lobe,
the task of language processing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:10%
seems to have shifted over
to her right hemisphere.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Ella Striem-Amit, a
cognitive neuroscientist

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
at Georgetown
University, told "Wired,"

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
quote, "The remarkable
thing about this patient

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and other such patients
who were missing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
large chunks of their
language system at birth

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%
is how well they compensate."

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
For EG, the study has
been a welcome validation

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
after decades of being
made to feel defective.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
As she wrote in the
published paper,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
quote, "Please do not
call my brain abnormal.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
My brain is atypical.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
If not for accidentally
finding these differences,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
no one would pick me
out of a crowd as likely

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to have these or any
other differences

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that make me unique."

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Fedorenko's team plans to
conduct several more studies

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:10%
on EG and expects to come
away with an even richer

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:10%
understanding of the brain's
seemingly limitless potential

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:10%
for flexibility and adaptation.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
EG hopes that, quote, "It will
also take some stigma away

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
from atypical brains."

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this has
been a "Gaia News Breakdown."
