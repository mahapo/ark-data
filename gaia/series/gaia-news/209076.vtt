00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Congress doubling
down on UFO legislation.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.920 align:middle line:84%
First the House, now the
Senate is demanding answers,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.480 align:middle line:90%
going back decades.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Congress is continuing
to say to the DoD

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and to the intelligence
community, we want action.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Gaia News.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Members of Congress, not pleased
with the lackluster response

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to last year's UFO-related
legislation, which

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
called for sweeping
changes and oversight

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to the reporting
of UFO activity,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
have just passed even
stronger language

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in the Intelligence
Authorization Act for 2023.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Mirroring the House
legislation, the Senate

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
would also create a secure
system for reporting UAPs,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
as well as loosen the
restrictions on or release

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
people from
non-disclosure agreements,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and calls for a deep dive into
how UAP-related activities were

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
handled by the government,
dating back to 1947.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So what makes this
bill so groundbreaking?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope served with the
UK's Ministry of Defense

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:10%
covering UAP activity.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.010 align:middle line:10%
>> We now have some really
strong language in the draft

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence Authorization
Act for fiscal year 2023.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that Congress
is continuing to say to the DoD

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and to the
intelligence community,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
we want action on the UAP issue.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are clearly
not letting it go.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, the
language is robust.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
They are articulating
a number of must-haves

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
here, which we've
not seen before.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What are these not seen
before must-haves included

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
in this bill?

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the key provisions
is going to be a strengthening

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of the collection methodology
and the science plan.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They're separate
but related factors.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, half the equation
is, if you see something,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.493 align:middle line:90%
say something.

00:02:20.493 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We're still not getting
all the reports.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
There's still some stigma,
though that is lessening.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But the science plan
comes in because you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
can have all the
reports you want,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
but if they're not then
subsequently investigated

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.000 align:middle line:84%
in a proper way,
it's meaningless.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the absolute key pieces,
which is completely new,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
is, you'll remember when the
Congressional hearing took

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
place back in May, one of
the representatives asked

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
about the 1967 Malmstrom
missile shutdown case.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
lot of blank looks

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and looking at each
other, and, well,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
we don't really have
anything on that.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.453 align:middle line:84%
And I think there was a
sense that, hey, look, DoD

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence
community is trying

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
to pretend that
this is a story that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
started in 2004 with the
USS Nimitz, and it's not.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:10%
This is a phenomenon
with a 75-year backstory.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:10%
And what the new
language says is,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:10%
we want to hear some
of that backstory,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:10%
because what they say is
that the General Accounting

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:10%
Office must go back and
review all holdings, all

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:10%
the information, written,
oral, whatever they've

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:10%
got since 1947, which is
a clear nod to Roswell,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:10%
amongst other things.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What should we look out
for as this legislation moves

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
through Congress?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't get too sidetracked
by the House version,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
the Senate version, the
Intelligence Authorization,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
or the NDAA.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Keep an eye on the NDAA.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's always the big
flagship piece of legislation.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
The Senate wording in the
Intelligence Authorization Act

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:90%
is strong.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:10%
We'll see-- the only
danger is that it

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:10%
gets watered down a little.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.089 align:middle line:84%
See what goes into the
final version of the NDAA

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and watch for other
left field developments.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this is
happening in isolation.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The legislation could be
passed as early as October

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.665 align:middle line:84%
or after the midterm
elections in November.

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:36.860 align:middle line:90%
