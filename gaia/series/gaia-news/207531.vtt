>> Psychedelic-assisted therapy
at the Veterans Administration.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.550 align:middle line:10%
And could hallucinogens
actually improve personality?

Psychedelic-assisted
therapy has recently

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:10%
gained mainstream
acceptance among civilians.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But what about for members
of the military and veterans?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
This therapy may soon be an
option for some veterans.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
As Lucid News reports,
psychedelic-assisted therapy

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
is on the rise at some Veterans
Administration hospitals.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:10%
Phase 3 clinical
trials of MDMA therapy

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:10%
to treat post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:10%
have been so
successful, with 68%

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:10%
of participants in remission.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:10%
The FDA granted MDMA a
special breakthrough therapy

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:10%
designation.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
But this therapy is
not yet available

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
all over the country,
prompting more researchers

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to call on the VA to create
protocols for MDMA, psilocybin,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:90%
and ketamine therapies.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
These psychedelics are still
classified as schedule one

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:84%
narcotics, and it will
take political will

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and bipartisan support
to win FDA approval.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
If that happens,
researchers at the forefront

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
of these therapies hope to
see Veterans Administration

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
hospitals nationwide using
psychedelics to help veterans

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%
by the year 2024.

Could the use of
hallucinogens actually improve

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:10%
your personality?

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
A new study published in the
journal Frontiers in Psychology

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
looked at how psychedelics
affect personality.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:10%
Researchers recruited
adults who are planning

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:10%
on using hallucinogens
in the near future

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:10%
and asked them to fill
out a survey regarding

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:10%
their personality based
on the five-factor model

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:10%
of personality traits, including
extroversion, neuroticism,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:10%
openness to experience,
agreeableness,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:10%
and conscientiousness.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Participants took the
survey three times:

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:84%
before their
psychedelic experience,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
two weeks after their
experience, and four weeks

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The results were impressive,
with people reporting

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
a reduction in neuroticism and
an increase in agreeableness

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
even four weeks after
their experience.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Brandon Weiss, a psychologist
at Imperial College London

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:10%
and the lead of the research,
told Psychology Today,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:10%
"first people seem to
report that they were not

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:10%
as quarrelsome or critical in
their interactions with others.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Second, people
reported that they

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:84%
were less easily upset by
things and less anxious."

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Weiss also pointed out
that despite these positive

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
outcomes, hallucinogens
can be dangerous,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
especially with people who
have pre-existing psychosis.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
More data is needed to
confirm the study's findings,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
as a large number
of participants

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
did not follow through
with the entire survey.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But this is more evidence
that hallucinogens

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
could be another tool to
help with mental health.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:90%
