00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrial life are

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
A new survey of US astronomers
and astrophysicists

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:10%
puts the search for
habitable planets

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:10%
on the top of their list
for the next 10 years.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
This survey by the
National Academies

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
also spelled out how to
ramp up resources, including

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
ground and space telescopes.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia
News contributor

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:10%
Marc Dantonio on the report.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a number of
aspects of this report,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:10%
which are very important
to take away from the news,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and that is, number one,
professional astronomers,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
tenured professors, astrophysics
schools, all are saying,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:10%
we know there's life out there.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:90%
That's number one.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Number two, they're saying we
want to be able to find it.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
This is very important,
because what we're seeing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is part of the continued
shift toward that end

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of the spectrum.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So astronomy is
being dragged in.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers are being
dragged, kicking and screaming

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, not all
anymore, down the path to say,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we know life
exists, and we think

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:90%
we can probably detect it now.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And we'd like to.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge shift,
I mean, a huge shift.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like people in
the general public are open

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:90%
to the idea of off planet life.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Why is this report
so significant?

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It is news when you consider
that academia has never really

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:90%
bought into that.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.039 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a Harvard
astrophysicist saying this,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:90%
you see the writing on the wall.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Academia is going
down this path,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to keep
going down this path.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:10%
And they're going to pursue
finding life in the universe.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Meantime, the much
anticipated James Webb Space

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:10%
Telescope is scheduled to
finally launch this month after

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle line:10%
a history of
postponements and delays.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Why are astronomers so
excited about this telescope?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at James Webb
Space Telescope's capabilities,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find that the
James Webb is probably the most

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
significant mission in our
history to this point on Earth,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and the reason is because what
it stands to be able to show

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It might be able to
answer the question,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:90%
the real, true question.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Is there life out there?

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be able to see
the atmospheres of exoplanets,

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
around distant
stars, and we'll see

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
things that might indicate
that there is life there.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
important revelation

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
we can't do right
now, because we

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
don't have a telescope that's
really got the resolution

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, James Webb is there.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have that
strength on our side.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
important thing.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You could answer that
ultimate question.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The National Academies
of Sciences weighed

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:84%
in on their hopes
for the future.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
What does astronomer Mark
Dantonio look forward to?

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope that we identify
planets out there that are

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
suitable way stations for
travelers from Earth that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
eventually might
want to go there.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Sure, we can't ply the
gulf between the stars now,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:90%
but we know ways too.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And we know ways to do
it fast and quickly,

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's something
that I'd love to see.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
In 10 years, I'd love to see
an established program to do--

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I won't say faster than light
travel but warped space travel.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to see progress there.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to see the James Webb
give us candidates for planets

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
that we think
might actually have

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
signs of industrial
pollutants, signs of oxygen

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere inferred
from other chemicals

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.480 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere, like
carbon dioxide and methane,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.177 align:middle line:90%
and other possibilities.

00:04:36.177 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And those other possibilities,
that's the mystery.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are
signatures of life.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The next 10 years promises to
show us some incredible things.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.473 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, we'll understand
some of these other phenomena

00:04:49.473 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
that are occurring

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
right now too that right now
we don't understand too well.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether or not the
recommendations in the survey

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
will be followed
remains to be seen,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:84%
but the James Webb Space
Telescope planned launch date

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:90%
is December 22.
