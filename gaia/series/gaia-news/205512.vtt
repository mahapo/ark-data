00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Could there be an
increase in the use of tarot?

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.990 align:middle line:10%
If so, why now?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.100 align:middle line:84%
What is driving this surge of
interest from truth seekers?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Tarot cards, once
believed by some people

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
to be evil or dangerous
can now be seen everywhere.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:10%
Tarot has gone mainstream.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.970 align:middle line:10%
Christian Dior offers the
designs for decor, dinnerware

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:10%
and fashion but tarot and
oracle decks for divination

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:10%
are the best sellers.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
US Game Systems, a leading
publisher of tarot cards

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:84%
tells the "Financial
Times" they've

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:84%
had to double their print
runs in the past year

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:90%
because they sell out so fast.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not just tarot, "The
New York Times" reports data

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
from Yelp showing searches
for supernatural readings more

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:90%
than doubled in April.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Why are so many people
turning to these methods now?

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz,
author of "The Seekers

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:10%
Guide to The Secret Teachings
Of All Ages" explains.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.112 align:middle line:10%
>> People are interested because
there's truth in these things.

00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:10%
They discover truth
in these things

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:10%
just like they discover truth
in therapy and in philosophy

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
and in spirituality.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So people gravitate to
things where there's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:90%
some sense of discovery.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history, people
have sought their own path

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:84%
to self discovery and healing
especially during times

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
of uncertainty.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to keep
in mind that the occult

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and the esoteric are evergreens.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They're a permanent fixture of
our culture and our society.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
There does seem to be
an uptick of interest

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:84%
during periods of
crisis, for example,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
during the Civil War there
was an uptick of interest

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:90%
in spiritualism.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The same was true during World
War I. During World War II,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
sales of the Ouija
board doubled.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:84%
So when people are
anxious, they seek

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to avail themselves of
insight whether it's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
spiritual or therapeutic
or occult in nature.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>> When some people
hear the word occult,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
they think something
evil or satanic.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:90%
The truth is far different.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Occult is a term derived from
Latin that just means secret

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:90%
or hidden.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a term that came into
use during the Renaissance

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to refer to the philosophies of
the ancient world, the mystery

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
traditions of the ancient
world, Rome, Greece, Egypt.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was just a
way of referring

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to hidden or mysterious
philosophies that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
were being rediscovered
during the Renaissance.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no sinister
connotation to the term occult.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The act of tarot reading
is the ultimate do it yourself

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
entry into the
esoteric teachings.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Some believe there is a
form of channeled energy

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
from the cards.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I perform tarot readings
myself mostly in private and I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
ask myself the question,
is there anything here,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:90%
or is this just a Rorschach?

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Is this just a random draw?

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
a possibility

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that certain divinitory
pictogramatic tools like tarot

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
or the i Ching,
they may represent

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
a kind of frozen
snapshot in time

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that gives us a sense
of everything that's

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
going on all around
us at a given moment

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
if one accepts that
time itself, linear time

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:90%
is really just an illusion.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to prove that
to ourselves in various ways

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and hence tarot seems
to give us a broader

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
perspective on what's going on
than we normally have access

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The real meaning of
occult is secret or hidden,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
but these methods are no
longer secret or hidden.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
In times of need,
feel free to use

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
whatever tools of divination
or truth seeking work for you.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And as Mitch Horowitz says, tap
into this universal symbolic

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.248 align:middle line:10%
