00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.410 align:middle line:10%
>> UFO sightings are
on the rise this year,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.110 align:middle line:10%
the Department of Defense
confirming at least some

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:10%
of the photos are real.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.920 align:middle line:90%
So what are we actually seeing?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:84%
One researcher has a different
take on this phenomenon.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.375 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
UFO sightings by
civilians and military

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:84%
have been in the
headlines recently.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But one researcher says he has a
theory as to what we are really

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:90%
seeing.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
If you look closely
at these pictures,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:90%
you can see sphere-like crafts.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:10%
In his book "Quantum
Paranormal,"

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:10%
Patrick Jackson argues
the spheres are actually

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.240 align:middle line:10%
here to protect us.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:10%
>> What I think these objects
are are the same things of what

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:10%
the pilots came into contact
with during the 1940s.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They generally operate
at 100,000 feet

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
in lines and clusters.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:84%
And normally there's a
cluster of, say, 50 of them,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and they all fly
together as a swarm.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So you have type 1,
type 2, and type 3s.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Type 1s operate at 100,000 feet.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
What they appear to
do is control access

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:90%
to Earth's airspace.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And they intercept--
how can you say--

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
like external groups and
interests or hostile UFOs.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a question out
there that people ask

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
is where are all the aliens?

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, what
if they're being kept out?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And the system appears
to keep them out.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:90%
Type 2s are smaller.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
They operate in woodlands.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
People see them
as balls of light.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the type 3s
operate in buildings.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And they are
predominantly effectively

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
in the communication system,
like a satellite in reverse.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Which also they're
primarily responsible

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:90%
for poltergeist activity.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> An extraterrestrial
artificial intelligence

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:90%
network?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
How do they communicate
with each other?

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:10%
>> You have swarms of
these objects, I would say,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:10%
in one part of the country and
another swarm on the other side

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:10%
of the country.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when
something comes in,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
they can't communicate
with each other.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:90%
So they relay it off the ground.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:10%
So once that data link
is established, then

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:10%
they can basically
communicate with each other,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:10%
identify the target,
triangulate on it,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:10%
and intercept it
at the same time.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:10%
So they allow the very stealthy
intercept of these objects.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
There has been
many videos of UFOs

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
getting blown up up in the sky.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
caught them on camera.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
There have been many pictures
of these little spheres

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the crafts.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The most recent one was
the US Navy photographs,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
that weird
triangle-looking craft.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you look closely,
you will see three spheres

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
surrounding it,
triangulating on it.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Every time one of these
craft are detected,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
these will go in and
triangulate on it.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
basically tell it to leave

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.610 align:middle line:90%
or it's blown up.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> If this extraterrestrial AI
network is threatening other

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
aliens with destruction, how
do they know who to keep out?

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe they use a
simple rule-based artificial

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
How that works is is that
you'll have a set of rules

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:90%
and a set of facts it goes by.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the
artificial intelligence

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
will be triggered by a
particular observation.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it will have
a pre-coded outcome.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time
it runs autonomously,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
but now and again, I think it
is controlled manually as well.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.747 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
AI isn't perfect.

00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I think it makes mistakes.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think it sometimes
intercepts the wrong things.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That, by the way, is why when
it comes to paranormal and ghost

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
stuff like that, or
poltergeist, they all

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:90%
generally behave the same way.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:84%
They always have the same
pattern, the same mechanisms

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
at work all around the world.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we hope to learn
about extraterrestrials

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and paranormal phenomenon by
understanding how these spheres

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.593 align:middle line:90%
work?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to
understand what they are,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and what they do,
and their reasoning.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.302 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from what I can
tell, aliens do exist,

00:04:28.302 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and they are out there.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But you have a lot of friendly
ones and some hostile ones.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And basically this system
keeps the hostile ones out,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:90%
or at least it tries too.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that
once you understand

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
how the architecture works,
it explains just about

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
every effect people see
in these haunted houses

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:90%
and up in the sky as well.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is is that once we
start going to Mars in a SpaceX

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
landing, I think this
system is going to become

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:90%
very apparent very quickly.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think the military
has been dealing

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
with it for a long time
and they haven't really

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
known what they have
been looking out,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
or at least they're
not really sure.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there any reason people
should be concerned about

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.783 align:middle line:90%
the sphere system?

00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that people
shouldn't be afraid of this

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It's been with us
for a very long time.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's doing
its best to keep us out

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:90%
of trouble, actually.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It does have byproducts.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:90%
It does have problems.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And it does its best to
warn us away from danger.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I've heard
of many positive encounters

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:84%
as well where people could
actually summon them and do

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of things.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The people, whoever controls
it or anything, I have no idea.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
However, I do think
that these objects have

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
been with us since
biblical times,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:84%
as these spheres are actually
depicted in the Bible.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:90%
So it could be the same thing.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:90%
It might not be.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Patrick Jackson's theory that
extraterrestrial aerial spheres

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:84%
are using Earth as a
communication relay to protect

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.080 align:middle line:84%
humanity may sound
like science fiction,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
but more research must be done.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Till then, we remain
open to the possibility.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:10%
