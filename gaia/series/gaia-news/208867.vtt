a look back and forward at
what Carl Sagan famously said.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> The cosmos is also within us.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%
We are made of star stuff.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.810 align:middle line:84%
We are a way for the
cosmos to know itself.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan's famous line,
we are made of star stuff,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.660 align:middle line:84%
is not just hyperbole
or even theory.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
A 2017 study showed the six
most common elements of life

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and phosphorus are
found in stars.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:10%
This idea has been
the driving force

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:10%
for countless astronomers,
including Gaia News contributor

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Marc Dantonio.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Carl Sagan was my
favorite astronomer.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
And I heard him say
when he first said it.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
We are made of star stuff, OK.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:90%
That man was absolutely correct.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're made of,
every atom in your body,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
every atom in the room
around you, every atom in--

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
every single thing
on this planet,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:84%
was once made at millions,
and millions, and millions

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of degrees in the
heart of a star.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And what do they do?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
They explode when they're
done with their lives

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
because they run
out of their fuels.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And that stuff blows
out from the star.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:90%
It goes everywhere.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
It goes out in all
directions, and there are so

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.880 align:middle line:84%
many trillions, upon
trillions, upon trillions

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of massive supernovae that have
occurred that the universe is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
littered with their debris.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And their debris happens
to be many of the elements

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:90%
in our periodic table.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> If we all come
from the same source,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
what are the implications,
not just for humanity

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:90%
but for the planet?

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the
beings on this planet,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
every single creature
on this planet,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and including the Earth
itself, and all the planets

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, and
all the moons, all right,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
are literally all connected
because they were all made from

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:90%
the very same solar nebula.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Basically, we're all family.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this physical,
tangible connection across

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
everything in our universe
translate into our collective

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you ever been in a room?

00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:42.020 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting down, and
you think of someone you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:90%
haven't talked to in 10 years.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And that instant they call you?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I talked about
that at a conference.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.572 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that on the
stage, the very first thing

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:52.372 align:middle line:90%
I said.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:53.914 align:middle line:84%
I said how many has
that happened to?

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And every single hand went up.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, everybody
started laughing.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that coincidence?

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Science tends to tell you
that that's what it is.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:90%
But I don't think it is.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something known
as quantum entanglement

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.330 align:middle line:90%
but at the more higher level.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:90%
I call it the "brainular" level.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, our brains
were manufactured

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
from all the elements
created by the solar nebula

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
here in this region
of the universe.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And, perhaps, there is a
link to life in general

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
when formed in the same
place, the same way.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:90%
We might look different.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
We might be different,
very different.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But we might also have
this link, a very primitive

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary link that goes all
the way back to the beginning.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.323 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be
arrogant enough to say--

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I would never be
arrogant about it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and say that can't
possibly happen.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't say that something
that you can't possibly

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
research yet can't
possibly happen.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
You just have to say
it's an interesting idea.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And, maybe, it's true.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:90%
We would need more research.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What should people consider,
when we think about the fact

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that all beings on Earth and
even our solar system are made

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:90%
of star stuff?

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It means that we're all
one species that's based

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:90%
on the same chemistry.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
At the very least, it means
that we should all be together

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of ways.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We should all have a meeting
of the minds, so to speak.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Those minds, by
the way, which were

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
born of this tumultuous
universal beginning

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in the hearts of a star,
in the heart of a star.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think that moving forward,
I think that what we need to do

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
is consider that
everything that we are

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from everything
that we've been,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and comes from everything
that we were made from.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> During divisive times, it
is important to remember we all

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:90%
came from the same place.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're more alike
than different.
