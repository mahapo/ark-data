00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The Large Hadron Collider
fired up for the third time,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.100 align:middle line:10%
as scientists search
for new physics.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.180 align:middle line:84%
What else might they
find in Switzerland?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:10%
The Large Hadron Collider,
the world's largest particle

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
collider, is up and
running for the third time.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:10%
Run by the European Organization
of Nuclear Research, or CERN,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:10%
near Geneva, Switzerland,
the purpose of the collider

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:10%
is to allow scientists
to test theories

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:10%
and predictions of particle
physics, and find new physics.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:10%
Completed in 2008, the
Large Hadron Collider

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:10%
has had two operational
runs, from 2009 to 2013, 2015

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:10%
to 2018, and now, this month,
after a long hiatus, to improve

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:10%
and upgrade data
collection and detectors,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:10%
the Large Hadron
Collider is at it again.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
As the journal, Nature, reports,
the first two operational runs

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
tested and explored
known physics.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.120 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of the
Higgs boson particle,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
or God particle, in 2012,
was part of that work,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and reaffirmed current models
of how the universe works.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
This time, they are looking
for new physics and unknowns,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
like dark matter.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.150 align:middle line:84%
They accelerate particles near
the speed of light in a 17 mile

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
underground circular
tube, smash them together,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and see the results.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, with the new detectors,
they should be able to comb

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:10%
through data with more accuracy.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Sarah Demers,
a physicist professor

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:84%
at Yale University who is
working on the third run,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.950 align:middle line:84%
told National
Public Radio, quote,

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
"there has to be more
out there because we

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.750 align:middle line:84%
can't explain so many of the
things that are around us.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:84%
There's something
really big missing.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And by really big,
we're talking about 96%

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:90%
of the universe really big."

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:10%
But some people are worried
about what is going on at CERN.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Social media has been
exploding with theories, often

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
with a version of the claim,
they're hiding this from you.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Some popular theories include,
CERN is using the Large Hadron

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Collider to open portals
to another plane,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
a parallel universe, or
some sort of stargate,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.350 align:middle line:84%
or CERN is trying to
create black holes.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
This stems from
CERN saying it might

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
be possible to create
tiny black holes,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
but tried to clear that
up with this statement,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
"The LHC will not
generate black holes

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmological sense.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
However, some theories
suggests that the formation

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
of tiny quantum black
holes may be possible.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The observation of
such an event would

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
be thrilling in terms of our
understanding of the Universe,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
and would be perfectly safe."

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:10%
CERN has also announced
they've had a smooth start

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:10%
to their experiments so far.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
This third run is planned
to last four years,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
with the fourth run
scheduled to start in 2030.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:84%
