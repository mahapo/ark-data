00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A new theory on the cause of
mysterious radio signals from

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.820 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And UFO briefings have
begun on Capitol Hill.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.500 align:middle line:90%
What have we learned so far?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.665 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia news breakdown.

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.635 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:10%
As we've previously
reported, Fast Radio

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:10%
Bursts or FRBs for short, lasts
only a fraction of a second

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:10%
but puts out massive
amounts of energy,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:10%
with some putting
out repeated signals.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
They were only
discovered in 2007

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
but have baffled astronomers.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
What or who is
sending these signals?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
There have been many different
cosmological theories including

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:90%
attempted alien communication.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
But now, a new theory published
in the Astrophysical Journal

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:84%
says the repeating
signals could be

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
caused by the interaction
of a neutron star

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
with its host planet in a
highly elliptical orbit.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if the planet's
elliptical orbit

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
takes it so close to
its host neutron star,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
the tidal force
influenced by gravity

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
would tear fragments
from the passing planet.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And these fragments,
say the researchers,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:90%
would produce FRBs.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So far, this is just
a computer model

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:90%
but it is seen as a good clue.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Astronomers will have to
observe the repeating fast radio

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
bursts in real life to see
if this hypothesis is valid.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:10%
Meantime in Washington DC,
secret briefings on the latest

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:10%
UFO information have begun.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:10%
According to Politico, members
of the Senate Intelligence

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:10%
and Armed Services
Committees have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:10%
begun receiving classified
briefings on the latest

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:10%
intelligence on UFOs.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But, Politico reports,
lawmakers are not

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
impressed by the lackluster
response from the National

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Security Agencies.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:10%
These briefings are required
as part of the National Defense

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:10%
Authorization Act signed
in December of last year.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:10%
The legislation also
calls for the Pentagon

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:10%
to create the Anomaly
Surveillance and Resolution

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:10%
Office.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:10%
Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand who penned

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:10%
the Amendment to the National
Defense bill last year

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:10%
and who has called the
UFO phenomenon a, quote,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:10%
urgent issue, reportedly is
not satisfied with the response

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:10%
thus far.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
An aide to Senator Gillibrand
who spoke to Politico

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
said, quote, Senator
Gillibrand believes

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the DOD needs to take this
issue much more seriously

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.420 align:middle line:90%
and get in motion.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They have had ample
time to implement

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
these important
provisions and they

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
need to show us that they
are prepared to address

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:90%
this issue in the long term.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:10%
Or to paraphrase
Politico, lawmakers

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:10%
want more serious
analysis of UFO activity,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:10%
not just more reports
that they exist.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
However, some
anonymous intelligence

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
officials told Politico progress
is being made, but added,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
quote, is there somebody
at a high level who

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is an advocate who
owns this problem

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and is putting together
a plan to get the answers

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:90%
that Congress wants?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer
to that is no.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon's Anomaly
Surveillance and Resolution

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Office is supposed to be up and
running by June of this year.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
