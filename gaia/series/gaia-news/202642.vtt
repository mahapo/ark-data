00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:10%
>> In the US, the biggest
battle over genetically modified

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:10%
organisms is happening
in California.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.490 align:middle line:10%
Voters will be deciding
whether to require labeling

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:10%
of GMOs on food packaging.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.790 align:middle line:10%
Earlier today, I spoke with
Robyn O'Brien about prop 37

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:10%
and the fight against
GMOs in the US.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:10%
She's a children's health
advocate and author

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.450 align:middle line:10%
of The Unhealthy Truth.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So the call for labeling of
genetically modified foods

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:84%
is a hot topic in
California right now.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
How do you see what Europe
is doing compared to what

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:90%
we're doing here in the US?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.182 align:middle line:90%
Is it that tipping point?

00:00:43.182 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think what we're
having here in the US is really

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.780 align:middle line:10%
a food awakening.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.803 align:middle line:10%
And it's largely
prompted unfortunately

00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:10%
by the rates of diseases that
we're seeing in our country.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:10%
You hear these stats from
the American Cancer Society

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:10%
that 41% of us are expected
to get cancer in our lifetime

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.573 align:middle line:10%
or that the CDC reports that one
in three Caucasian kids and one

00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:10%
and two minority
kids are expected

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:10%
to be insulin dependent by
the time they reach adulthood.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
One in three kids now has
autism, allergies, ADHD,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:90%
or asthma.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And so these conditions
and these diseases

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.543 align:middle line:90%
are hammering our families.

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, we're
starting to pay attention

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.752 align:middle line:10%
to the food we're eating.

00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:18.117 align:middle line:10%
And we're realizing we
don't know a whole lot

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:10%
about how it's produced,
what the ingredients are,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:10%
how it's made.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
And I think from
that food awakening,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:10%
we're starting to see this
interest in different parts.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think this, the sudden
awareness that, hey, we've

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
got these genetically engineered
ingredients in our food supply.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
They were only just introduced
in the last 15 years.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I
not know about it,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't even
put on the label.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:10%
That's something that people
have a reaction that's

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:10%
pretty similar to that
pink slime reaction where

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:10%
you're like, wait a minute.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:10%
This isn't even
about the science.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:10%
This is simply about
putting something in my food

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.490 align:middle line:10%
that I didn't know was in there.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you think that it's just
outrage that is prompting this

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:10%
proposition 37 that is on the
November ballot in California?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is basically,
what is, is it

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that cut and dry,
to label GMO foods

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:90%
or to not label the foods?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I really do.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
look back, and you

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
consider some of
the conflicts we've

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
had around different ingredients
in the food industry,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
there were concerns
around saccharin.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.588 align:middle line:84%
You think back to
the days of Tab.

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, you think about
the conflict, for example,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:90%
around the tobacco industry.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Our grandmothers were
marketed to using doctors

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:90%
in cigarette ads.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the first
time that there's

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
been a product that
suddenly has hit

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.002 align:middle line:84%
the market that consumers
all of a sudden wake up

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%
and say, wait a minute.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:90%
There is evidence of harm.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:90%
There is concern.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And we simply want to know
what we're feeding our family.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Is it outrage
that's driving that?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it may manifest
in a fear or a sadness

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
or an anger or an
outrage, but underlying

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:84%
all of those emotions
is flat-out the love

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
we have for our families.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.163 align:middle line:84%
And this love we
have for our country.

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I think when you look
at the rates of diseases, what

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
it's doing to our national
economy, what it's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
doing to our health care system,
we have got to get this right.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> But there was a lot
of money, big money,

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that is going into
campaigning for the "no,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to
label our foods."

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Who's on that side?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And who's-- is it just the
general public that is saying,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:90%
no, we want them labeled?

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.337 align:middle line:84%
I served as a financial
analyst, and I

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
covered the food industry.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.837 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at
what the industry

00:03:26.837 --> 00:03:28.837 align:middle line:84%
is doing, what the chemical
companies are doing,

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's the chemical
companies that genetically

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.882 align:middle line:84%
engineered these seeds
so that they could

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:90%
sell more of their chemicals.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That is a brilliant
business model.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if I were on
the board of directors

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:84%
of any of those companies,
I would say, kudos.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
You're doing a great job.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
That's your fiduciary
duty as executives

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to drive shareholder return.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So they're selling more of
their chemicals or weedkillers,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And so with industry,
with these industries that

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
are so incredibly powerful,
you think how powerful

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
the food industry is.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on the
planet has got to eat.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:10%
And so those industries
have deep pockets

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:10%
that far exceed anything that
these smaller groups could

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:10%
put together.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:10%
And so as executives
who are responsible

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.670 align:middle line:10%
to these shareholders,
absolutely,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:10%
they're going to
pour as much money

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:10%
as they need to into
battling this legislation.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:10%
And the Grocery Manufacturers
Association has come out

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:10%
and said, this is our
number one priority,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:10%
to defeat the labeling.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:10%
So again, they're trying to
avoid liability on their side.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Because should these ingredients
be proven to cause harm,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
if there are labels
on those products,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
then there's liability,
there's accountability,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and there's traceability.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the food
industry is trying to avoid.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what calls for
us as citizens to take action.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, because they're
trying to avoid those costs

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.510 align:middle line:90%
on their balance sheet.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But if these ingredients are
causing harm, which right now,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
we don't have those
long term studies.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
No long term human
trials were ever done.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.693 align:middle line:84%
There's no free market safety
testing required by the FDA.

00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
There are no
prenatal studies that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:84%
have been conducted,
no pediatric studies.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:10%
So we're essentially that trial.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:10%
And so by avoiding
labeling, those companies

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:10%
are avoiding any liability.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:10%
But what happens is that if
there are costs associated

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:10%
with these products, with
these genetically engineered

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:10%
ingredients, we carry
them on our balance sheets

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.237 align:middle line:10%
in the forms of
health care costs

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:10%
that are associated with
food allergies, the added

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.543 align:middle line:10%
cost of the grocery
store budget,

00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:10%
when you're dealing with
diabetes or allergies

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:10%
or cancer, any of
these conditions.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.467 align:middle line:84%
And so while these
companies are doing

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
what's in the best interest
for their shareholders

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
by externalizing these
costs, often what happens

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
is that those costs
get put straight

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
on to our personal
balance sheets.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And we carry them with
these rates of disease.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What can we do then?

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:10%
>> As consumers, as
concerned citizens,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:10%
I think probably one of the most
patriotic things that we can be

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:10%
doing is really getting
involved in this food awakening.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:10%
We all have family
members that are

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:10%
impacted by either food
allergies or diabetes

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:10%
or cancer.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Cancer is the leading
cause of death

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:10%
by disease in kids under the
age of 15 in the United States.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.425 align:middle line:10%
And so there's so
much that we can do.

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:10%
We have introduced a whole
bunch of new ingredients

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.022 align:middle line:10%
into our food supply in
the last 15 or 20 years.

00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:10%
We're the first
generation of women

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:10%
to be part of that experiment
through our pregnancies.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And hearing that is so hard.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:90%
It hurts to hear.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, once you
learn it, then you realize,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
There's so much we can do.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.652 align:middle line:84%
We can dial back on our exposure
to some of these genetically

00:06:19.652 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:90%
engineered ingredients.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
We can change the way we
shop a little differently.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We're a nation of
300 million eaters.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.463 align:middle line:84%
And every time we navigate
that grocery store,

00:06:27.463 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
we're sending a message to
those food companies about what

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:90%
we want or what we don't want.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> What is California doing?

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And do you think that the rest
of the nation will soon follow?

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what's so interesting
about California is that

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
because there is a complete
lack of any federal legislation

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.502 align:middle line:84%
around the labeling of
genetically engineered foods,

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:84%
California's saying,
you know what?

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:10%
The jury's still out on this.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.533 align:middle line:10%
Sure, industry funded
science says one thing,

00:06:52.533 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:10%
but independent studies are
starting to say another.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And while we're
debating the science,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:10%
we simply want to give
consumers the right to know.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:10%
And so they've introduced
legislation at the state level.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:10%
A great parallel was
the seat belt laws.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.153 align:middle line:10%
There's never been a
federal seat belt law.

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:10%
And so that was introduced
at the state level.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
as recently as 1984,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that was the first seat
belt law in New York.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.712 align:middle line:84%
And so here's California
saying, we just

00:07:16.712 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
want to give consumers
the right to know.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.962 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
to me is that they

00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:21.710 align:middle line:84%
tried to introduce
legislation that

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
was going to call on
the beverage industry

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to label an ingredient that
also might have the potential

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:90%
to cause cancer.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
It was a caramel color
that Coke and Pepsi

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.140 align:middle line:90%
used in their products.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And rather than go through
the labeling and all

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
of the liability
that it might carry,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
all Pepsi and Coca-Cola
decided to do was reformulate.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result of
California's influence,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Coke and Pepsi
reformulated their products

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:90%
across the country.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could see a
similar response from industry

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So definitely keeping our
eyes and ears peeled on this

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.025 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much, Robyn
O'Brien, for coming in today.

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:10%
It's been a pleasure.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:90%
