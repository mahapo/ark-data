our true potential for
health and well-being,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:84%
or is there another, more
expansive perspective

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.840 align:middle line:84%
on the role genes
play in our lives?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not the
genes that count now.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It's how we respond
to the environment,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:84%
how we respond to the signals
that we send to the genes.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
After decades of
research, scientists

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
have recently announced
the completion

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:84%
of the human genome, what some
call the genetic instruction

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Widely used for guiding
biomedical research,

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
many experts herald this
as a crowning achievement

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Bruce Lipton is
a cellular biologist

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:10%
and a pioneer in the field
of epigenetics, which

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:10%
takes a comprehensive,
cutting-edge approach

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.887 align:middle line:10%
to the understanding of our
relationship to our genes.

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Most people are really
excited by the fact that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:10%
the human genome
has been deciphered.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:10%
They've identified how many
genes are in the human genome.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.800 align:middle line:84%
The original reason
for the human genome,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
it was thought that genes
control all the characteristics

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.120 align:middle line:90%
of our life.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if I had a
compendium of all the genes,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I could fix anybody who
has a characteristic they

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:90%
want to change.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Francis Crick, one of the
co-founders of the story,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
came up with something
called the central dogma--

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
the belief that
genes are the source

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:90%
of biological information.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They're translated
into another form

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:90%
of nucleic acid called RNA.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:10%
So DNA goes into RNA, which is
like a Xeroxed copy of the DNA.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:10%
And then the RNA is
used as a template

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:10%
to make the proteins
of the body.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
According to the central
dogma, information only

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:90%
flows in one way.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
It flows from the DNA to
the RNA to the protein.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
This led to an understanding
called genetic determinism.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Genetic determinism
is the belief

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that the character of
your life is controlled

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
by the blueprints, the
DNA that you inherited

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of conception.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This genetic determinism
was the prevailing theory

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
of genetics for many decades.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lipton was one of the
first to challenge it,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
beginning some 40 years ago.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The central dogma was
never proven scientifically.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The central dogma was a
suggestion and hypothesis.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, there's
a new science that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:84%
really undermines that whole
story of the central dogma.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And the story is
called epigenetics.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is under genetic control,
so genes control cancer.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
The new science is cancer
is under epigenetic control.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, epi means above.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And I say epigenetic means
above the gene control.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Genes do not turn on and off.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Genes are blueprints.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Genes can be read or not read.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But the genes don't determine
which one is going to happen.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> According to epigenetics,
what does determine what will

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:90%
happen?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The environment
and, more importantly--

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and this is important-- our
perception of the environment

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is the information that
controls our genes.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Change your environment.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
You change your
genetic activity.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
Change your belief about life.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
genetic activity.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Now there's something even more
important, and that is this.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The old story is a gene is a
blueprint that makes a protein.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Fact.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The Human Genome Project
now has been whittled down

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to that humans have
about 20,000 genes.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
There are over 100,000 different
proteins and only 20,000 genes.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Where'd all the other
proteins come from?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, how we
respond to the environment,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
our perceptions of the world
can alter our genetic blueprints

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
so that a single
gene blueprint can

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
be used to create over
3,000 different proteins

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:90%
from the same blueprint.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> For Dr. Lipton, the
implications of this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:90%
understanding are profound.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Under genetic
determinism, we're victim.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:90%
The gene creates your life.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, we
go from victim to mastery.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.810 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do
it with knowledge.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.717 align:middle line:84%
If you have no
knowledge of epigenetics

00:04:48.717 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
but are programmed of the
belief that you a victim

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
of your heredity,
then your belief

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
about your family's
heredity becomes your life.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
you are the creator,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:90%
then guess what?

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.762 align:middle line:84%
For the first time, if you
understand the nature of it,

00:05:01.762 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
then you have the power
to change the creation.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do we go about getting
beyond programmed thinking

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:90%
and become masters of our genes?
