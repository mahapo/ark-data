>> Could some alien abduction
encounters actually be lucid

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.580 align:middle line:10%
dreams?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:10%
The latest research on the
phenomenon in a new report out

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.520 align:middle line:10%
of Russia, this is "Gaia News."

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Are some instances of alien
encounters and abductions

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:90%
actually just lucid dreams?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what researchers at the
Phase Research Center in Russia

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:84%
sought to find out in a new
study recently published

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:84%
in the "International
Journal of Dream Research."

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
A lucid dream is a
dream where the person

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
knows they are dreaming while
they are still in the dream.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
In the study, 152 volunteers
and experienced lucid dreamers

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
were prompted to
experience aliens and UFOs

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in their lucid dream.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Of those, 75% had alien and UFO
encounters in a lucid dream.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:10%
61% said they had encountered
alien like creatures.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And 28% said they
encountered UFOs.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:10%
For lead researcher and founder
of the Phase Research Center,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:10%
there was a personal
connection to this study.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> It happened more
than 20 years ago.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:10%
I believed I experienced a
typical alien abduction story.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:10%
I was abducted.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
It happened upon awaking.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:10%
With sleep paralysis, with a lot
of fear, levitating, and so on.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I believed in
this for two years.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:10%
But then I started to practice
lucid dreams and out of body

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:10%
travels.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:10%
And it helped me to understand
that all the time I was

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:10%
experiencing the same thing.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And aliens were just in my mind.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite learning his alien
abduction experience was,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
in his opinion, a lucid dream,
Michael does believe there is

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
life in the universe.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that our universe is
so big that there are numerous,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe endless amounts
of civilizations.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
there are aliens.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:10%
But when we see
them upon awaking,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:10%
or before falling asleep,
during relaxation, most likely

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:10%
these stories are
about our brain.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the most significant
discovery you made from this

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:90%
study?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> In our study,
from 152 volunteers,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
75% of them were able to
experience alien abduction

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
or encounter with
a UFO or aliens.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:10%
And most interesting is
that 20% of these stories

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:10%
were very similar to
reality, and the people,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:10%
in theory, mixed
it up with reality.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If the findings of
this study are true,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
how do we explain regular
people who encounter aliens

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously without
prompting in their dreams?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, recall my situation.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And the first fears
that I thought about

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was aliens, because
I read stories

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:90%
how it happens to other people.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:90%
I watched movies.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, people
wake up, for example, they

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%
experience sleep paralysis.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what's
going on to them.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:10%
And they recall all these
stories from movies,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:10%
from books, and
lucid dreaming space

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:10%
emulates their expectations.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, for example,
if you don't believe in aliens,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:84%
but you are a very religious
person, you may see angels.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael is quick to point
out that this study accounts

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for alien abduction experiences
only when lucid dreaming.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So our study refers just
for specific stories when alien

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
abduction happens upon
awaking and falling asleep.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Me personally, I believe
that our universe is endless,

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there's endless
amounts of civilizations.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:10%
If we exist, why other creatures
could not exist right now?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there are billions
of civilizations or millions

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> This study may shed light
on why so many people around

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
the world believe they have had
alien abduction experiences,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
but does not explain them
when people are awake.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
To paraphrase Michael
Raduga, he says

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:84%
he believes in aliens, just
not when we are asleep.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
