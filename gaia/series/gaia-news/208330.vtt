00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> The search for
extraterrestrial life may come

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.750 align:middle line:10%
down to finding
biosignatures in space.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
The James Webb Space Telescope
is poised to do just that.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:10%
And NASA's Artemis
1 Moon mission

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.390 align:middle line:10%
is about to take the next
step to put humans back

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.060 align:middle line:10%
on the lunar surface.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:90%
This is a Gaia News breakdown.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
As we have previously
reported, one

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
of the tools
scientists are using

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to detect life on
other planets is

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.000 align:middle line:90%
the existence of biosignatures.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
A biosignature, put simply,
is a biological sign of life.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:10%
On Earth, our biosignatures
are gases like methane, oxygen,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:10%
and some carbon dioxide.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, a new study out of the
University of California Santa

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:10%
Cruz says methane could be the
first detectable sign of life

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:10%
on an exoplanet.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And the researchers
outline how to determine

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.490 align:middle line:90%
if it is a sign of life or not.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.510 align:middle line:10%
As Maggie Thompson, lead
author of the study, said,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:10%
"on Earth, the vast majority of
methane is produced by life."

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to reason that
in certain instances, that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:90%
would be true on other planets.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
This is of particular importance
now as the James Webb Space

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Telescope is preparing to
take its first readings

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
of exoplanets atmospheres.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And the telescope has on board
one of the most sophisticated

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
instruments to date and
can easily detect methane.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Thompson argues, "oxygen is
often talked about as one

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:10%
of the best biosignatures,
but it's probably

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:10%
going to be hard to detect
with the James Webb Space

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:10%
Telescope."

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:10%
The researchers made a
three-part case for methane

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:10%
as the best possible
biosignature.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
First, it would be unsurprising
for life on another planet

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to produce methane.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Second, methane would not
last for long on a planet

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:90%
without constant replenishment.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:10%
And third, it would
be easy to tell

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:10%
if the gas was being produced
by a non-biological source

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:10%
like a volcano.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Also, as Space.com reports,
upon the discovery of methane,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
it has a better chance
of being a biosignature

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:84%
if atmospheric carbon dioxide is
present, if the atmosphere has

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
more methane than
carbon monoxide,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and if the planet
is not water rich.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Following these
guidelines, the researchers

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:84%
argue should prevent
false positives.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
The James Webb
Space Telescope is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
scheduled to send back results
to Earth later this year.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.880 align:middle line:10%
NASA's preparing to put
astronauts back on the Moon.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
This week, NASA rolled
out the Artemis 1 rocket

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:10%
for a series of tests for the
wet dress rehearsal, where

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:10%
the rocket and team will go
through most of their launch

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:10%
day procedures,
including fueling,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:10%
hence the name wet
dress rehearsal.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the first NASA
mission to the Moon since 1972,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and is just the
beginning of the plan

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
to put human bases on the
Moon, with the ultimate goal

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
of reaching Mars.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:10%
Most of the dress rehearsal
will be live streamed by NASA

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:10%
but some information
will be classified.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:10%
The unmanned Artemis
1 is expected

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:10%
to launch sometime
this summer depending

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:10%
on how the dress rehearsals
go for roughly one month

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:10%
mission around the Moon.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:10%
NASA plans to send astronauts
around the Moon in 2024

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:10%
and putting astronauts on
the lunar surface by 2025.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And this ambitious plan hopes
to put the first humans on Mars

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:90%
by the year 2040.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News breakdown.
