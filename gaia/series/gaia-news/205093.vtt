00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year, the
Orbital Assembly Corporation

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:84%
revealed details about their
planned Voyager Station,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
a rotating space
station and hotel

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
they say will create varying
levels of artificial gravity

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and will be able to
accommodate up to 400 guests.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The craft will rotate
in low Earth orbit

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and be accessed by shuttle.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:10%
The company plans to begin
assembly of the 650 foot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:10%
wide spacecraft in 2025 with the
goal of human visitors by 2027.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:10%
They say the station
has been designed

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:10%
to accommodate businesses,
researchers, and, quote, space

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:10%
tourists, who want to
experience life on a large space

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:10%
station with the
comfort of low gravity

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:10%
and the feel of a luxury hotel.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:10%
Amenities include 24 habitation
modules, restaurant and bar

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:10%
modules, and a gym that
will hold concerts as well

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:10%
as sports.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.362 align:middle line:84%
For civilian space enthusiasts,
this may seem like a dream.

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
challenges ahead

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:90%

Astronomer and "Gaia News"

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:10%
on the likelihood of
meeting that 2027 goal.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say 2027
is probably early.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:10%
There will be setbacks-- there
are with every single project.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.640 align:middle line:84%
They will be using technology
that's not tested, all right?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
They can't use tested
technology because there

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:84%
are no space station
technologies out there now.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
to completely build

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:90%
these from scratch.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I just think that 2027
is a little ambitious.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But if they can muster
the right acumen,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
they can actually
get it done, and I'd

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:90%
be really interested to see it.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Assuming it can be built, the
craft will operate in low Earth

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
orbit, which might make
it easier to access.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But what other challenges
does low Earth orbit present?

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Low Earth orbit also has
other issues that are kind

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
of hidden, that you
don't think about.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
One of them is other orbiting
space junk that's actually

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:90%
moving from orbit to orbit.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the
same orbit as you,

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
it's moving about the
same speed as you.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's not the danger.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
The danger is something that's
crossing through the orbit.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
That is something that could
literally rend the space

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:90%
station into pieces.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.636 align:middle line:84%
A bolt that long traveling
about 14,000 miles an hour

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:53.298 align:middle line:84%
is not going to get stopped
by a piece of aluminum, OK?

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
It's actually and
go right through it

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and continue through it
and go through anything

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
else in between, including
guests if they're there.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:90%
What else are their issues?

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, the other issues
there are micrometeorites.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The ISS, the International
Space Station,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
has had damage done to
it by micrometeorites,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
little tiny pieces
of space junk that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
come in at tens of
thousands of miles an hour

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:90%
and just puncture things.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:84%
There's images of the
solar panels on the ISS

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.368 align:middle line:84%
that are literally
torn and shredded,

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
hanging and dangling

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
because these were destroyed
by a micrometeorite hit.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And these don't
come from space junk

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that we can follow or monitor.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
These come from nature.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We can't see these
micrometeorites.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:90%
However, I will say this.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.080 align:middle line:84%
If we don't do things
like this, then humanity

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is doomed to just stay
on our blue marble.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
the best place for us.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:10%
>> We've seen a rush of private
investment in space technology

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:10%
in recent years.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:10%
What does this
private space race

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:10%
hold for the future of
off-planet exploration?

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Commercialization of space
in the private sector is

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:10%
inevitable.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:10%
And I actually think it's
good for the continuation

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:10%
or the extension of
humankind's presence in space.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, people say, oh, they're
just big corporations going out

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:90%
into space.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe so.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it on your own?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it on your own, OK?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.308 align:middle line:84%
You have to do it
with a big company.

00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So yes, big companies are going
to be the first when it comes

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:90%
to private space exploration.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
There will be
private space rovers.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:90%
There'll be private moon rovers.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.468 align:middle line:90%
There'll be private trips.

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we're just going

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.280 align:middle line:84%
to have to get used to, because
that is how humanity is going

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.100 align:middle line:90%
to expand to the stars.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Many astronauts have reported
being awestruck when they see

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:10%
the Earth from space--

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:10%
the Earth with no borders,
no wars, no conflict.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The Earth from space has been
described as tiny, beautiful,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:90%
and fragile.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon has been
dubbed the overview effect.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
If space tourism
becomes a reality,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
how could this affect
the future of our planet?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that if we could just
put everybody into orbit one

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:10%
time in their lives, then the
overview effect would have

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:10%
a-- it would definitely take a
positive toll on their lives,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:10%
and they will always look
at the Earth differently.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The Voyager Station is a
monumental task within a short

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:10%
time frame.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:10%
But even if they don't
meet the deadline, who

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:10%
knows what
discoveries they might

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:10%
make while trying
to reach that goal.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to book a room
on the first hotel in space,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%
they are taking reservations.
