>> Researchers discover the
world's largest geoglyphs

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.300 align:middle line:90%
in an Indian desert.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Will the findings
reveal who made

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.230 align:middle line:84%
these giant, enigmatic
designs and why?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.715 align:middle line:90%

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Geoglyphs are sprawling
designs made by digging

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
into the earth or piling up
stones to form what mostly

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
appear as geometric lines
and more rarely as humans

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and animals.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Usually only fully
visible from above,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
they can be found
all over the world.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Some dating back to prehistoric
times, others quite recent.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The most famous to date are
the Nazca Lines in Peru.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
While there are various
theories around their builders

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and function, none
have been proven,

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
be widely debated.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:10%
Carlo Oetheimer is an
independent researcher

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:10%
of geomorphology, the
study of Earth's landforms.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:10%
While conducting a Google Earth
survey of India, he and his son

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:10%
and colleague, Yohann Oetheimer
made a fascinating discovery.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I was traveling
over the desert,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I found
lines in the desert,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:90%
similar to the Nazca Lines.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed and I
said, oh, what's that?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I find one place,
and two places,

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and eight places almost.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.825 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way I found
the Thar Desert-- the Boha

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:41.625 align:middle line:90%
geoglyphs.

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So on the Google
Earth's images,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
we could see a
concentric spiral--

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:90%
concentric lines.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really know
at that point what

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:84%
they were, but we had to go
on the site, on the field,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
to see exactly--

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.855 align:middle line:90%
to understand them better.

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:10%
>> When the researchers
visited the desert site

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.115 align:middle line:10%
in India's Rajasthan region,
what they found astounded them.

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We brought a drone with us
to be able to take the aerial

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:90%
photos of the geoglyphs.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:10%
The drone images,
we could finally

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:10%
see the true form of the
line, which is a spiral.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:10%
>> All those cliffs
are really, really big.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:10%
That are the biggest geoglyphs
discovered so far on Earth.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a big spiral, which is
11 kilometers continuous line.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:10%
Other one, which is
connected to the spiral,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:10%
is a serpent-shape line
with many patterns.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:10%
We have managed to reproduce
48 kilometers of lines.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Around the lines, we have
archeological features which

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
are called memorial stone.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The big ones are in
memory of deceased person.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
For us, maybe, these landmarks,
the mark is a symbol of death.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
if there are

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:84%
connections between these Hindu
memorial stones and the lines.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the difficulty of
precise archeological dating

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:84%
in a desert environment, the
Oetheimers are very cautious

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
about providing any definitive
interpretations of the origins

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and meaning of the geoglyphs.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They are, however,
working on some ideas.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Concerning the antiquity
of the lines, the main point,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
of course, is not the fact that
they are at least 150 years

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly,
but I am almost

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:90%
sure that they are not old.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting here
is more the symbols.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But as the line ends
with a little spiral,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
or begins with a
little spiral, we

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
were wondering if
this was a kind

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
of global symbol of the life
of a human in the Thar Desert.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's obviously made
to see from above.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.670 align:middle line:90%
So who is above?

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol of the
heaven and the afterlife

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and the gods, whose
north-south lines,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
we were wondering if they
could symbolize something

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:90%
with the cosmos.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we
got the idea that we

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
could try to superimpose
the Ursa Minoris, so

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
the constellation of Ursa
Minoris on this spiral.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
This gives an
interpretation for how

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
this is a message to the
cosmos, to the people

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
who are in this other world.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The team plans to continue
trying to glean further

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
information about these
fascinating designs.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
However, it is likely, they
say, that the true origins

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:90%
will remain a mystery.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:10%
