00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The financial system has been
turned on its head in the past

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.050 align:middle line:84%
few months with the rise of
what has been nicknamed "meme

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.370 align:middle line:90%
stocks."

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000 align:middle line:10%
But is this grassroots movement
of regular, everyday investors

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:10%
a passing trend, or could
they really transform

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:10%
the way our economy
works going forward?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.025 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:10%
Meme stocks, called
such because they

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:10%
are ordinary stocks fueled by
people through social media--

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:10%
their value can spike
based on zeitgeist

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.660 align:middle line:10%
and not the fundamentals of
the companies they represent.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
As a result, they can
oftentimes be highly volatile.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Made famous by the popular
subreddit, WallStreetBets,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:84%
this is truly a
grassroots movement.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But even with the
increased volatility

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that comes with these
stocks, investors

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:90%
are not shying away from them.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Many investors are doubling
down despite warnings

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
from financial institutions, or
is it perhaps in spite of them?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But what is driving the
popularity of meme stocks,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and why do they continue
to grow contrary to what

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:90%
markets dictate?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:10%
Zeus Yiamouyiannis, author
of "Transforming Economy:

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:10%
From Corrupted Capitalism
to Connected Communities"

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:10%
explains.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the first
thing, I think,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:10%
is the larger social phenomenon
of the little guy getting

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.490 align:middle line:10%
screwed and the big
guy rigging the game.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has never
been more rigged,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and the concentration of wealth
has never been more dramatic.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is, it
creates this groundswell

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
of a desire to strike
back at an unfair system,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:84%
to strike back at
these profiteers,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and to win one for
the little guys.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And the language for doing that
has been this language of meme.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:90%
It's snarky.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's satirical.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:90%
It's edgy.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
with GameStop, which

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:84%
is the premier, obviously,
example of the meme stock.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
reason for GameStop

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.587 align:middle line:84%
is many people had a
nostalgic association,

00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to see this go down.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So that was a real
positive motivation.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And they had that the
negative motivation,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
which was to absolutely
screw these short sellers

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and these big hedge funds by
going ahead and blowing up

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:90%
their shorting.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When hedge funds short a
stock like GameStop or AMC,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
they're betting on these
companies' stock going down

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
and making profit
from their demise.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
When some investors
saw this happening

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to their favorite
companies, they

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
decided to do
something about it.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The guys rebelled.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.108 align:middle line:90%
It was WallStreetBets.

00:02:39.108 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%
They said, wait a minute.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's all jump on the bandwagon,
do the exact opposite.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
There were memes and messages
to send out to the internet.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And nerds of all stripes and
all ethnicities jumped on,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and people who really wanted
to say screw the big guys

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, I don't
want this nostalgic thing--

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:90%
AMC is another one.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want movies
to go away, and I

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
don't want these great
little video game

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
stores that I'm used to,
when I was a kid growing up,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to go away.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to keep hold of these.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But how can investments based
on nostalgia and emotions have

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
a lasting effect on a financial
model that is so rooted

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:90%
in our economic foundation?

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think meme stocks
are a foray or a spearhead

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
into piercing the
financial guard.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
The old guard will
move the goal post.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.773 align:middle line:84%
That has to be part
of their game plan.

00:03:30.773 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll even do it
in your face, in ways

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that can be either semi-criminal
or even outright criminal,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:90%
just to laugh at you.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of
arrogance creates

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:90%
more energy of resistance.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And heading into the future, is
to go ahead and recognize this.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:90%
We recognize it.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
We find ways to
withdraw our energy.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
We find ways to create
alternative forms of exchange.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>> With a large amount of money
up for grabs and an economic

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
model in flux, is there a
healthy and unhealthy way

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
to approach these new markets?

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The healthy motives of
engaging in name stocks

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and cryptocurrency are the
desire for decentralized,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
non-top-down, basically autonomy
and sovereignty for ourselves.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing
to lose your money

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to move things in
the right direction,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you know you're not
doing it for simply greed

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:90%
or profiteering or opportunism.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing
it in a way that

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
is coherent with your own virtue
and with the sustainability

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And with meme stocks
and cryptocurrency,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you see this kind of
inveterate opportunism

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:90%
and just plain, old greed.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
That is a virus introduced
by that centralized, top-down

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
people to keep us down.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We have to confront that.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And one way to confront that
is to look at our motivations

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
for getting into
cryptocurrency and meme stocks

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of the bad motives
and go for the good ones.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Even if we can succeed in
stamping out the corruption

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and change the system
for the better,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is there any way that we can
make sure these changes are

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
lasting?

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:10%
>> What we've learned is that no
amount of new technology or new

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:10%
thing is going to
save it for us.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Cryptocurrency is not
going to save us, right?

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Meme stocks aren't
going to save us.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
What's going to save
us is when we really

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
go for a win-win situation, when
we understand that we're not

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
in a competitive relationship
and a paranoid relationship

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
That, literally, the
enhancement of community

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:84%
will enhance my
individuality, right?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And the enhancement
of my individuality--

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
my own divine
genius, that which I

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
have to offer, my talents,
well-received and respected--

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:84%
are going to enhance
the community.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:90%
That is the key right there.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the metaphysical
and even practical key.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to break from this
competitive, dog-eat-dog

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:90%
mentality based in fear.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.568 align:middle line:84%
That's the single most
important thing we can do.

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Though meme stocks might
have started out as a joke,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
their impact on the
economy is undeniable.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But will this
grassroots movement

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be the linchpin
to the sweeping changes

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to move forward with a fair and
democratic financial system,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
or is this just a passing fad?

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
If we question why we are
investing the way we are,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
could that lead to making
a difference in the world?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:10%
