00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> As psychedelic healing
and plant medicine goes more

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340 align:middle line:84%
mainstream luxury psychedelic
tourism is on the rise.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Good news for the
spread of this medicine.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.370 align:middle line:10%
But how might over-commercialism
affect this sacred practice?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
A recent Bloomberg
article highlights

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:84%
the rise in luxury all-inclusive
psychedelic retreats.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous plant medicines
have been around for centuries.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And their health
benefits have been

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:90%
scientifically demonstrated.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But as they gain
mainstream acceptance

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and find a bigger audience
some only see dollar signs.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:10%
Bloomberg reports, "according
to Data Bridge Market Research,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:10%
the psychedelic
market is projected

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:10%
to grow from $3.8 billion in
2020 to $10.7 billion by 2027."

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:10%
With the potential to
make a lot of money,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
could some
unscrupulous companies

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
capitalize on this trend
and remove the sanctity

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:10%
of this sacred practice?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Specifically
regarding ayahuasca.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:10%
Carlos Tanner is the director
of the Ayahuasca Foundation

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:10%
in Peru.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
He founded the center
in 2009, as the result

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:90%
of his own healing journey.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.920 align:middle line:10%
>> When I started
our retreat center,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:10%
the Ayahuasca Foundation, I
was coming off of a seven-year

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:10%
study myself.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Like, a four-year apprenticeship
where I lived with a Curandero.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And then several
years after that was

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:90%
studying with other teachers.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And most people that
were starting centers

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:84%
at that time, which wasn't that
many, you were a student first.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, after years of
study, you came to the point

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
where you wanted to
offer this to people

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:90%
from outside of the culture.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we see people that don't
have very much experience

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
at all, but yet, they're
opening a healing center.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:10%
>> As this budding industry
is dealing with rapid growth

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:10%
there's some complicated
issues regarding its increased

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:10%
popularity.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to the
commercialization of substances

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that have an ancestral
background I would say that it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
is a delicate situation.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that there would be
a benefit to those Indigenous

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
populations from which those
traditions were originated.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I
know many Indigenous people

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and they are for the
spreading of what they

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
believe to be their culture.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Which, oftentimes, was something
that was looked upon negatively

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
or was degraded as if they were
second class citizens, quite

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, like, having people
from the Western world,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
from the modern world want
to learn or experience

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
elements of their
culture, I think,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:90%
gives them a sense of pride.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's a complex
question, to say the least.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:10%
>> What are the pros and cons of
making ancestral plant medicine

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:10%
more accessible to
a wider audience?

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The pros would obviously
be that they can--

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
they'll be able to select
from a wider or higher range

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
of comfort level.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the past
your comfort level

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
was only going to get so high.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Because there really
wasn't this luxury

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
level of ayahuasca retreat
or even psychedelic retreat.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You're basically in an
uncomfortable environment

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't made
very comfortable

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
the way that a lot of
tourists expect comfort to be.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
The con, on the
flip side of that,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
would be that there
is actually, a lot

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of benefit from the
environmental influence.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily,
mosquitoes biting you or heat.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But your proximity to the
rainforest or your proximity

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to the land where the
Indigenous tribes actually live.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The resort might be beautiful
and they've got a great pool,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
but the person who's
leading the ceremonies

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:84%
isn't connected to
that environment.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
biological resonance

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:90%
with that environment.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
access to the plants

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that they would
use in conjunction

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:90%
with the psychedelic therapies.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Carlos believes even though
the benefits of plant medicine

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
can be attained anywhere,
the act of stepping out

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of your comfort zone can
only add to the experience.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If you decide to do an
ayahuasca retreat in the Amazon

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.520 align:middle line:84%
rainforest, it's almost
like making a pilgrimage.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you don't have
to do much to get there,

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
there isn't some
journey involved just

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to get to that
process I feel you're

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
less likely to have that
same level of activation.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have that
same level of determination

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:90%
demonstrated to yourself.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And so, I know the
results of doing a retreat

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
or attending ceremonies
or receiving treatment

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
in its Native setting
and especially,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
if it's, kind of, an
uncomfortable setting

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
or if it's a challenging
setting will be higher.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> As psychedelic therapies grow
in popularity and more people

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:90%
decide to try it, remember.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:84%
This is strong medicine
and should only

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
be undertaken under
supervision of a trained guide.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:10%
