>> Is it possible to communicate
with spirits by adjusting

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.840 align:middle line:10%
your brainwave frequencies?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.960 align:middle line:10%
Renowned psychic Mark
Anthony explains how

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:10%
in his new book, The
Afterlife Frequency.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:10%
Mark Anthony is a
psychic medium who

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:10%
has been communicating with
spirits since he was a child.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:10%
In his new book, he
presents the latest research

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
in the fields of quantum
physics and neuroscience

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:10%
to explain how anyone
can tune into what he

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:10%
calls the afterlife frequency.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>> We know from matters
of faith that the soul--

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:10%
the who and what we
are-- pre-exist the body,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:10%
comes into the body, moves
on after the body dies.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.040 align:middle line:10%
We also know that the
brain from neuroscience

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:10%
has a coherent
electromagnetic field.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:10%
We know from the laws of
physics that energy is neither

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:10%
created nor destroyed, only
transferred from one form

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:10%
to another.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I developed the
term "the electromagnetic soul"

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
to describe what we
really are, which

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is pure consciousness that is
eternal electromagnetic energy.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything has
its own vibration.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything is made
of molecules, which

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
are made of atoms, which are
made of electrons, protons,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and neutrons, which are
made of the smallest

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
particle, a single particle
of a quantum, which

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:90%
is electromagnetic energy.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
different vibration.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Spirits are on a
much higher vibration

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because they are not tethered
to a lower, slower, denser

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
That would be the corporeal
entity known as our body.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Just how does this
electromagnetic soul facilitate

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.354 align:middle line:84%
communication with those
who have left their bodies?

00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, think of our world, the
material world dimension as AM

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
radio in its energy
vibration and frequency.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
And the other side as FM radio.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
afterlife frequency.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And in our world, AM and FM
are too energetic systems

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
that coexist and coincide,
and it's the same thing

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:90%
in spirit communication.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You have the material
world frequency

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
and the afterlife frequency.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And even though
they are separate,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
there are times when the
two frequencies overlap,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and when that happens, you
get an alignment, that's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.760 align:middle line:84%
spirit communication,
and henceforth, we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
are communicating with
the afterlife frequency.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark explains that we all
have two psychic receptor

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
regions in the body that can
allow us to enter into spirit

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.221 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that everybody
is capable of spirit

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:90%
communication.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, not
necessarily being a medium,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:90%
but in receiving messages.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we all have the
same basic physiology.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I explain in the
afterlife frequency,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
we have the pineal gland
and the solar plexus,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
which are the two receptor
areas in our body.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I go into great
detail explaining

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.480 align:middle line:84%
how they're sensitive to
electromagnetic frequency

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and the types of
information that you

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
receive through these
two different receptors.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Everybody receives
contact from spirits.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
It's whether or not
you're paying attention

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to it, whether or not you're
spiritually, situationally

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
aware.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why I developed
the RAFT technique.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Help people Recognize
science from spirits,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Accept it as real, Feel
it without fear, and then

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Trust in the message.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But many people negate
it, they block it.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
When they do that, they
create energetic blocks.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
ways that people

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:90%
create an energetic block.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And once you remove
that block, you

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
will see how spirit
communication, not only

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:84%
will be influencing your
life, it can actually change

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.161 align:middle line:90%
your life, and for the better.

00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Mark describes the source
from which spirits receive

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
information to transmit to
the living as the collective

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.788 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Think of your soul, your
EMS, your electromagnetic soul

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
as a drop of water.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you die,
that drop of water

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
plunges into the
eternal sea of souls.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call the
collective consciousness.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.338 align:middle line:84%
So then your EMS is
linked to other spirits

00:04:26.338 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that are linked to
other spirits that

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.170 align:middle line:90%
are linked to other spirits.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as sort of
this infinite internet.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And you maintain your
identity and individuality

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
but you are now
energetically interlinked.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
This is not some
far-fetched concept,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
this is based on
quantum entanglement

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
where on the subatomic level,
subatomic particles, even when

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
separated by a distance
of a billion miles,

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
if you influence one,
an immediate reaction

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
occurs to the other.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are energetically
tethered to our loved

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
ones in spirit as they
are to other souls.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why when
spirits will communicate,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
they can bring
forth information,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
medical information,
healing information,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of information
and data that far exceeded

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the scope of anything that
that individual person knew

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
while living in
the material world.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Will science ever
definitively prove

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%
the existence of this
afterlife frequency?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We are getting a lot closer
technologically to developing

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:84%
a device that can tune in
to the afterlife frequency.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Edison was the
first major scientist

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and inventor to believe that
such a device was possible.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Since Edison, we
all have all types

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:10%
of paranormal
investigation equipment--

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:10%
K2 meters, EVP, ultraviolet
infrared scanners, I mean,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:10%
the spirit box.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:10%
They're all designed to scan the
electromagnetic frequency band.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:10%
I was in the laboratory of Dr.
Gary Schwartz at the University

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:10%
of Arizona, and he is
currently developing technology

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:10%
known as the soul phone
which will and already

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:10%
does tap into and communicate
with the afterlife frequency.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you something.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Within our lifetime, it is
conceivable and quite possible

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that there will be a device
where we can literally tune

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.600 align:middle line:90%
in to the afterlife frequency.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Until then, Mark hopes
that his research will serve

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
as evidence that communication
with spirits is possible if we

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:90%
just tune in.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:10%
