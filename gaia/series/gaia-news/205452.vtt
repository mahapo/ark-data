>> Could Sasquatch be of
extraterrestrial origin?

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.230 align:middle line:84%
A controversial recent
scientific experiment

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.440 align:middle line:84%
provides some ardent believers
with compelling evidence

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:90%
for that theory.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:90%

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
In a recent
experiment, researchers

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:10%
injected human stem cells
into primate embryos

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
and were able to grow
for the first time

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:10%
a human primate chimera.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The intent of the experiment
was to provide new insights

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
into developmental
biology and evolution.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
While the study generated
a great deal of controversy

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
due to ethical
concerns, it is actually

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
serving a very different
purpose for cryptozoologists

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and their work on Sasquatch.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary is a cryptozoologist
for whom this experiment has

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:10%
taken on great significance.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It provides to him
evidence of his theory

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that the creature
known as Sasquatch

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:90%
is actually a chimera.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Cary's theory comes from
the remarkable findings

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Sasquatch Genome
Project conducted in 2013.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a study put
together by a geneticist named

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Melba Ketchum.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It included 110
samples that were

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.305 align:middle line:84%
sent in from all
over the country

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
by a cryptozoologist group.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
They're in the field for decades
and had collected what they

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
suspected was Sasquatch DNA.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
The results of that were
highly controversial,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and it led many of the
mainstream scientific community

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to completely dismiss
the results of the study.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:10%
The study concluded that
the mitochondrial DNA,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:10%
which is the mother's lineage,
was Homo sapiens sapiens--

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:10%
it was modern human.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The Y paternal DNA appeared
to be a genetic chimera

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
construction in and of itself.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
This new experiment by
world-class scientists

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
proves that even on a
basic gene-splicing level,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
you are able to successfully
fuse the two genomes together.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> For Jack Cary, there's
an even broader implication.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is important in
our battle to gain public

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
acceptance that creatures like
Sasquatch can and do exist

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and that there appears to be
an ET connection which would

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:84%
explain the highly advanced
chimera work that we found

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:90%
in the Sasquatch Genome Project.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Cary, there is
even more evidence for the ET

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that at least 20%
of all credible UFO or Bigfoot

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
sightings involves a
UFO also at the scene.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have documented,
me included,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
disappearing track lines of
these creatures where they seem

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to simply vanish into thin air.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's because
of the ET connection

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and that the ETs are actively
working with these creatures.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> While cryptozoologists
believe there's an ET

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
connection, they don't know what
the exact mission of creatures

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:90%
like Sasquatch might be.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Jack Cary has some ideas.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> There are indications that
they are being used almost

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
as like a avatar of sorts for
an alien intelligence that

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
actually has abilities that no
other life form on the planet

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:90%
has.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is yet another
argument that cryptozoologists,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:90%
me especially, has--

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:90%
have argued for a while now.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
These creatures have abilities
that no other creature has

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, and
there is nothing

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that will fill the
gap between the two.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In light of the recent
chimera experiment,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
cryptozoologists are now driven
more than ever in their search

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:90%
for answers.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no other cryptid
animal that exists in the human

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:90%
psyche like Sasquatch does.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
No other cryptid animal that
hunts the human psyche so much.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities of which we
are all actually afraid, even

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:90%
cryptozoologists like me.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The answer to the
Sasquatch mystery

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a much
bigger answer than

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
whether or not this is a
naturally evolved primate

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:90%
from the earth.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's going to tell us a
lot about our relationship

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to our accepted
reality, and that's

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
going to create a lot of change
that people right now don't

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:90%
even see or grasp.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
The repercussions
of proving Sasquatch

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
true in the minds
of the public will

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle line:84%
reverberate through our society
for a very, very long time.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> For researchers
like Jack Cary,

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:84%
this latest chimera experiment
could provide just the evidence

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
needed to prove Sasquatch's
mysterious origins.
