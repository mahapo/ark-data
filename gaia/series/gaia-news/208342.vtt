00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
science of ayurveda

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:84%
provides a safe, evidence-based,
and comprehensive way to do it.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The body can become
more self-aware,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:84%
more aware of problems and
as problems and initiate

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.145 align:middle line:84%
a natural, involuntary,
spontaneous healing response.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing or
detoxing the body has

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
been a key practice
throughout the 5,000

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
years of ayurveda's history as
a system of natural healing.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, research explains
the impressive results

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:90%
of the ayurvedic cleanse.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:10%
Dr. John Douillard is a
leading ayurvedic practitioner

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:10%
who has been incorporating
ayurvedic detox programs

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:10%
in his practice for decades.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:10%
He explains that
poor digestion is

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.935 align:middle line:10%
at the core of the need
for detoxification.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I think most people don't
realize that our ability

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:10%
to digest well is directly
linked to our ability

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:10%
to detoxify well.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:10%
In one survey reported, 74%
of the American population

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:10%
have a digestive
imbalance of some kind.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Suggesting that
not only are we not

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:10%
getting the nutrition in
that we need, but we're also

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330 align:middle line:10%
not getting the waste out
as efficiently as we could.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's waste or
impurities or toxins

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%
or pollutants kind
of everywhere.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So even if you eat really
clean, which is obviously

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
a really important
thing, you're still

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to
toxicity which means

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that you have to be able to
digest well to detoxify that.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why ayurveda
was all about making

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
sure every change
of seasons we do

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
a digestive reset,
a deep rejuvenation,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
repair for the digestion and
detox organs and pathways.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:10%
You're actually creating
a whole new population

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:10%
of bugs in your
gut that are based

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:10%
on this year's model which gives
you the stability and immunity

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:10%
for the entire year.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Given these
compelling reasons,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:10%
what are the best indicators
to notice if it's time for you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:10%
to do a cleanse?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>> How is your digestion?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.115 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a food intolerance?

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
You look on your
tongue in the morning.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
If it's white or coated,
ayurveda calls it "Ama"

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:84%
or undigested food, or
you're toxic, you're tired,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting the energy
from the lymph delivery of fat.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.535 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
is compromised

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and you can't take
the trash out,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.702 align:middle line:84%
so it's hard to come
out through your skin.

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
You get brain fog, headaches,
rashes, indigestion,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.375 align:middle line:84%
all these things
begin to happen.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So just how does this
toxicity build up according

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to ayurveda?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The fat, soluble,
heavy metals,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.690 align:middle line:84%
environmental
pollutants, pesticides,

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
endocrine disruptors,
they're all fat soluble,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
which means they have to be
broken down from being fat

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
soluble to water soluble before
your body can get rid of them.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the liver's
job and the liver

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.090 align:middle line:90%
takes a beating in our culture.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The liver gets overwhelmed
and becomes sludgy with bile.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
The bile becomes thicker
and more viscous.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.675 align:middle line:84%
Now, your whole upper digestive
defense is just compromised.

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The ayurvedic cleanse seeks
to address these root digestive

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:10%
issues to help the body reset.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And now there are mainstream
scientific studies

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
to support and explain
just how this happens.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So ayurveda has a cleansing
system using ghee as sort

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
of the main driver
of the cleanse.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, ghee or
clarified butter, that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
uses a natural key layer which
means the detoxifying agent

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.778 align:middle line:84%
to pull impurities out
of your deep tissues.

00:03:45.778 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have science to
back that up with something

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
called lipophilic
mediated detox where

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
you take a little bit of
ghee in your diet that kicks

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:90%
your body into fat burning.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Then you have a no fat diet
for the rest of the day.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is
that forces your body

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to stay in fat metabolism
during the day.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
The key is to get your
body into fat burning.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Other components of the
ayurvedic cleanse include

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
the incorporation of an easily
digestible mix of mung beans

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and rice called kitchari,
various ayurvedic herbs,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and meditative practices to
dial down the nervous system.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Douillard has for decades
seen the profound benefits

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:90%
of this protocol.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> While you're pulling fat
out of your deep tissues,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:84%
ayurveda says that the
molecules of emotion,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the old emotional toxins--

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
the mental Ama it's called--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.653 align:middle line:84%
are stored in your
fat and your muscle.

00:04:40.653 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
doing this cleanse,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
you're pulling those toxins
out of your fat cells

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're becoming
more on-screen,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
you're becoming more
self-aware of those.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:84%
You begin to have a level
of clarity and awareness

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
that you didn't have before.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
More aware of problems;
some problems and initiate

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
a natural involuntary
spontaneous healing response.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Thankfully, the wisdom
of this ancient science is

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
available to all who are
interested in getting

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
at the root cause of disease
and uncovering true well-being.
