>> With increasing
global temperatures,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.130 align:middle line:10%
the Maldives Islands are under
grave danger from rising sea

levels.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:10%
A Dutch architect has
considered the problem

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:10%
and believes he
has the solution.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:10%
Floating islands.

Working with the government,
the company Dutch Docklands

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:10%
is building 185 homes
docked to artificial islands

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
that will be anchored to
the seabed with cables.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:10%
At $1 million each, the
homes aren't a solution

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
for most island
inhabitants, but the hope

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:10%
is that the designs
can be adapted

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:10%
into floating
developments for the poor

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:10%
in other parts of the world.
