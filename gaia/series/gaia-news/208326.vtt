>> Recent scientific discoveries
suggest a new approach

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.000 align:middle line:10%
for managing inflammation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.180 align:middle line:10%
Will it be effective at dealing
with an issue believed to be

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.066 align:middle line:10%
at the root of all disease?

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so important to look at
the body as a whole and go, OK,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.135 align:middle line:84%
I have inflammation but
where does it come from?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's, cancer, diabetes,
heart disease, depression,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune disease--

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:84%
these are just a few
of the conditions

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in which inflammation is
known to play a major role.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Though a natural process to
rid the body of waste products,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
when excessive,
inflammation can wreak havoc

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
on multiple systems.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
In a new approach,
scientists suggest

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
they may have found a way to go
beyond current treatments that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
seek to stop inflammation,
often without lasting effect.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The new research focuses on
targeting immune cells called

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:84%
macrophages to help with
the cellular cleanup

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
necessary for inflammation
to fully resolve.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:10%
Dr. John Douillard is a leading
practitioner of ayurveda,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Indian system
of natural medicine

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:10%
often called the
"mother of all healing."

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.457 align:middle line:10%
>> Science shows--
which is great--

00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:10%
it says, we're going
to need to get in there

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:10%
and help manipulate the
macrophages to clean up

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:10%
the lymph in between
outside the cells.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:10%
Great idea.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:10%
But I would say let's do
that by going upstream

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:10%
and treat the upstream cause
of that inflammation versus try

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:10%
to put out the fire
with fire trucks

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:10%
because sometimes
those fires are just

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:10%
too big for the fire trucks.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayurveda has traced the
upstream issues causing

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.496 align:middle line:84%
inflammation to
several key factors.

00:01:55.496 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Information is a
double edged sword.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It happens in a natural way.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:90%
The body has a plan for that.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:90%
But it also can be excessive.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Amounts stems from the
isometric perspective

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
from a weak and broken
down digestive system.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't break your
proteins and your fats

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
down the way you should,
those proteins and fats

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
will go undigested into
your intestinal tract,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
they'll be too big to get
into your blood and feed you,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:84%
according to the studies,
and find their way

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
into the lymphatic system, which
lines your intestinal tract.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It creates extra weight
around your belly,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
it creates inflammation, and
an inflammation in the lymph.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Because remember
your lymph system

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:10%
is trying to do
three basic things.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
One, carry the trash out.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Number two, carry
your immune system.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And number three, carry
good, broken down fats

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
to every cell of your
body for baseline energy.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So inflammation is going to
cause fatigue and tiredness;

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:84%
it can cause a
compromised immune system.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Another cause of inflammation
seen as pivotal by ayurveda has

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to do with our
exposure to light.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We have a daylight
deficiency in our culture.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And getting out in the sun
is critically important

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
because that produces
antioxidants in our cells

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that prevent inflammation.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't get outside,
you're going to be inflamed.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The best biggest mitigators
for oxidative stress

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and inflammation is the sun.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:84%
70% of the sunlight
that we see outside

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is called infrared light,
which penetrates our skin

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
several inches and
activates the production

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:84%
of the energy in
the mitochondria,

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.112 align:middle line:84%
but it also activates
a antioxidant.

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And the name of that
antioxidant that is called

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
melatonin, but it's the number
one mitigator for inflammation.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What else besides getting
outside can we do to mitigate

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.836 align:middle line:90%
inflammation?

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that we all
know but don't maybe do as well

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
as we could is eating organic.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And organic foods are
important because when

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
you eat conventional foods
that have pesticides on it,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.760 align:middle line:84%
those pesticides kill the
microbes in your mouth

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that make the enzymes that help
you digest the food properly

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:90%
like wheat and dairy.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Processed foods have a
similar impact on the body.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's foods for
the lymphatic system.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is like
a berry or a cherry

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.065 align:middle line:84%
or a beet or a
cranberry, anything

00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:84%
that would return your
beautiful white shirt or red

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and stain it, is going to be an
antioxidant-based food that's

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
going to help support
lymphatic drainage

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
because the amounts would work
through your lymphatic system.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So those are good.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
All the leafy green
and alkaline foods

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
are very good for your
lymphatic system as well.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Stress is a big
factor and techniques

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
like meditation and yoga
and breathing techniques

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
are all powerful stress
reduction techniques.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But the body was designed to
handle stress and mitigate

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:90%
inflammation.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
nothing but stress

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
coming in and no
pulling back the bow

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and becoming calm,
then we just--

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I call it the eye
of the hurricane,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's the goal
of Ayurveda was

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to live in
the eye of this storm.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
inflammation doesn't exist.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:10%
>> While Dr. Douillard
commends Western scientists

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:10%
for their advances in
understanding the underlying

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:10%
mechanisms of inflammation,
he believes that when it comes

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:10%
to treating the root causes,
5,000 years of ayurvedic

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:10%
science has gotten
it most right.
