on Capitol Hill in more than 50

years.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.330 align:middle line:10%
What we learned, and
what was left out.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.050 align:middle line:10%
>> People who came out of that
closed session looked like they

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.850 align:middle line:10%
had seen a ghost.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> A historic public hearing
this week on Capitol Hill,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:84%
as the House Intelligence
Counterterrorism,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Counterintelligence,
and Counterproliferation

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
subcommittee held the first
open UFO hearing since 1966.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:10%
This hearing comes after some
lawmakers were reportedly not

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:10%
impressed by the
classified briefings

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:10%
they had received as part of the
National Defense Authorization

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:10%
Act.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:10%
In his opening
statement, Scott Bray,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:10%
the Deputy Director of Naval
Intelligence, had this to say.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We have seen an increasing
number of unauthorized and/or

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
unidentified aircraft or objects
in military-controlled training

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
areas and training ranges,
and other designated airspace.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Reports of sightings are
frequent and continuing.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> He went on to say one of the
reasons they have more reports

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
is because of their work
to destigmatize the idea

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of reporting UFOs, and putting
into place a system to report

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:10%
Despite there being
no major revelations,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.440 align:middle line:10%
there were several notable
moments in the hearing.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:10%
Here to break them
down is Cheryl Costa.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:10%
She served as a US Navy senior
electronic warfare specialist,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:10%
and is author of the "UFO
Sightings Desk Reference."

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Destigmatizing in the
military would be great--

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:10%
the fact that somebody
could report this data.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:10%
I worked as an electronics
signals analyst in the Navy,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:10%
and our job was to report
as much information

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:10%
as we could gather on everybody.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And so from the viewpoint of
the fact that we, for 50 years,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
it was a stigma not to
report this stuff that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
could get you grounded.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't a brilliant
idea, because at this point

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:10%
in the game if we have not been
collecting that information,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:10%
which it seems to
be we haven't been,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:10%
we're 50 years behind
the eight ball.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Chairman Schiff brought up
reports of aircraft showing

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:10%
abnormal flight characteristics.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we aware of any foreign
adversary capable of moving

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
objects without any discernible
means of propulsion?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I think I would--

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
without discernible
means of propulsion?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:10%
I would say that we're not
aware of any adversary that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:10%
can move an object
without discernible means

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:10%
of propulsion.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Which begs the question,
if it's not an adversary,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:10%
then what is it?

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:10%
>> They have-- and I'm going
to quote Lue Elizondo on this--

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:10%
that they've made a
generational leap in technology.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:10%
We better be paying attention.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:10%
But these things
have been flying--

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:10%
see, this is the stupid
thing about the fact

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:10%
that they put the stigma
on this back 50 years ago

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.110 align:middle line:10%
and say, oh, there's
nothing to see here.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:10%
These things have
been flying circles

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:10%
around our aircraft
since World War II.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:10%
>> And there was this exchange
when Congressman Gallagher

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:10%
asked about UFO interference
around US nuclear missile

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:10%
sites.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.130 align:middle line:10%
>> It's also been reported that
there have been UAP observed

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.672 align:middle line:10%
and interacting with and
flying over sensitive military

00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:10%
facilities, particularly--
and not just ranges,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:10%
but some facilities housing
our strategic nuclear forces.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:10%
One such incident allegedly
occurred at Malmstrom Air Force

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:10%
Base, in which 10 of our nuclear
ICBMs were rendered inoperable.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.468 align:middle line:10%
At the same time a glowing
red orb was observed overhead.

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm not commenting on
the accuracy of this.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.543 align:middle line:10%
I'm simply asking you
whether you're aware of it

00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:10%
and whether you have any comment
on the accuracy of that report.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me pass that to Mr. Bray.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.720 align:middle line:10%
You've been looking at UAPs
over the last three years.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
That data is not within the
holdings of the UAP task force.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.753 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a big deal.

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they've
been shutting down

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
our missiles since the
'50s, '60s, '70s, '80s.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:10%
While the articles have run
out in the news circuit,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:10%
nobody seems to
be upset by that.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And Congressman
Krishnamoorthi brought up

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:10%
something many
wanted to hear about,

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:10%
but was quickly dismissed.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:10%
>> How about wreckage?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:10%
Have we come across any
wreckage of any kind of object

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.623 align:middle line:10%
that has now been
examined by you?

00:04:41.623 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The UAP task force doesn't
have any wreckage that

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:10%
isn't explainable, that
isn't consistent with being

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:10%
of terrestrial origin.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.010 align:middle line:10%
>> We're on the public--

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.927 align:middle line:10%
they were doing the
public side of that thing,

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:10%
then they went into
a closed session.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
security issues there.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.433 align:middle line:10%
And if they've got this thing
classified a certain way,

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:10%
the congressmen are
only going to see it

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:10%
if they get into this
private, closed session.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:10%
And somebody, another
reporter told me

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:10%
that the people who came
out of that closed session

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:10%
looked like they
had seen a ghost.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:10%
There's the soft story
they're doing out in public,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:10%
soft peddling this
thing, and then there's--

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:10%
the people in Congress are
getting a stronger briefing.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As required by the National
Defense Authorization Act,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
we should expect
more public hearings.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:90%
What does Costa hope to see?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'm just excited
to see where this goes.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I hope this isn't just wrapped
up at the end of the week.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, we talked to all the
pilots and the spooks.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
I hope it doesn't
end up like that.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I really do hope that
they expand this and look

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
at it carefully.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is what
people are looking at now,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%
is would you be square with us?

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:10%
