00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Legends of giants
exist around the world.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And some say they have
even found evidence.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.990 align:middle line:10%
But mainstream science
dismiss giants as a hoax.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it time for a fresh
look at ancient giants?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Giants dismissed by science
and archeology as myth

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:84%
but embraced by many cultures
around the world globally,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
there are even structures that
would fit the giant narrative.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
But perhaps, most importantly,
oral histories, folklore,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
and even scripture
mentioned giants.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary, researcher and
author of "Paranormal Planet,"

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.476 align:middle line:10%
has studied this
phenomenon for years.

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The indigenous people
throughout the entire planet

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:10%
have these oral histories
of red-haired giants.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
indications and clues

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
as to who the giants were
and where they originated.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
important is Genesis 6:4

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:10%
in which it describes that
the Nephilim were on Earth.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:10%
They had children
by human women.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:10%
These children were giants.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of us
researchers believe

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that when they talk about the
Nephilim and interbreeding

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
with human women,
they were actually

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:84%
talking about genetic
manipulation, which

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is strongly alluded to
in the Sumerian tablets.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If they are so
prevalent around the world,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
why have we not
found any evidence?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The reason why we've not
found skeletal remains--

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
around the turn of the
century, the early 1900s,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
researchers have discovered
in the neighborhood of 900

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
newspaper articles all
talking about finding

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:90%
the remains of giants.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And in many of
them, they describe

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
having to give the remains to
employees of the Smithsonian.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And people often ask what would
be the motive for covering up

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
these remains?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The primary part
of the motive was

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:84%
related to what they
call Manifest Destiny.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Manifest Destiny was
used by European settlers

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
as a cause or a reason that
they had a divine right

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
to occupy the land rather than
the indigenous people of North

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
America, who they
considered savages.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And finding ancient
remains of other people who

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
had been there from
a long time ago

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:84%
is something that
probably, they thought,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
was going to cause people
to start asking questions

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
about their divine
right to be in this land

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
if it had already been conquered
by other people, et cetera.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The late 1800s was rife with
snake oil salesmen, grifters,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and conmen.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Journalism at the time wasn't
known for fact checking.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to people
who believe these skeletons

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and stories were fakes?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a lot of skeptics
out there about the mystery

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
of the giants in North America
who think that all of these

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
articles were actually a
form of what is called yellow

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
journalism.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a practice around that
time where journalists would

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:84%
sometimes embellish
stories in order to sell

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.790 align:middle line:90%
more copies of the newspaper.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
However, discovering 900
of them, and all of them

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
with very exacting details that
seemed to copy one another,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.110 align:middle line:84%
seems highly improbable
that they are all some form

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
of yellow journalism.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What did Native American
oral histories say about

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:90%
the existence of giants?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The Paiute have an ancient
oral history of having a war

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:10%
with red-headed,
cannibalistic giants.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The tale says that the
giants were cannibals

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and that they were stealing
people and eating them.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And this caused a war
between the Paiute

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and this race of
red-haired giants.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they were able
to kill off enough of them

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that they cornered the rest
in a famous cave now known

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:90%
as Lovelock Cave.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
And the tale goes that
they built a gigantic fire

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
at the mouth of the cave
and filled it full of smoke.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And as these red-haired
giants ran from the cave,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:90%
they killed them one by one.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
They called these
giants the Si-Te-Cah.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Now there was a Paiute
elder and she has a dress.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And she has stated publicly
that this dress, which

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
she calls a mourning
dress, is literally

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
woven from the red hair from
the red-haired giants mentioned

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the term "giants"
be relative to the size

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:10%
of the people at the time?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
A recent discovery in China
found 5,000-year-old skeletons

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that measured around six feet
tall compared to the average

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:90%
height of 5 foot 5 inches.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Could this be the answer?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Looking across the
Atlantic to the UK,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:90%
that may have been the case.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:10%
Science and history
writer Andrew Collins.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well it's said that Merlin--

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:10%
this most famous wizard
of British history--

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:10%
employed the services of giants.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And they dismantled this
original stone circle

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:90%
known as the Giants Dance.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And it was with these stones
that they created Stonehenge.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, quite clearly, this brings
into question of whether there

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:90%
existed giants in the past.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And what we can
say is that there

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
have been a large
number of graves found

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:84%
in the vicinity of Stonehenge
where oversized individuals

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
have been found.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Their skeletal remains
have been uncovered.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And these people are anything
up to 7 to 7 and 1/2 feet

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
in height, telling us that
as far as the ancient British

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
people-- if they
were much smaller--

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
then looking at
these individuals,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
they would have
considered them giants.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that these
people who created Stonehenge

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
were themselves giants.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We have seen folklore
and legends join us

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:90%
in the direction of the truth.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:10%
As we continue to
make new discoveries

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:10%
of our ancient past will
we learn that giants

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:10%
were real all along?

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:10%
Does the path to the truth lead
to an institutional cover-up

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:10%
or was it all just
myth and allegory?

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:10%
We'll be watching to see what
researchers come up with next.
