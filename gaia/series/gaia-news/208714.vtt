consciousness has just been

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.215 align:middle line:84%
Could consciousness be
explained by quantum effects

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:09.015 align:middle line:90%
in the brain?

things that are happening that

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
A 30-year-old theory on
consciousness, called

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
orchestrated objective
reduction, posits

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness could live in
tiny microtubules in the brain,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:84%
or as "New Scientist" explains,
quote, "Brain microtubules are

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the place where gravitational
instabilities in the structure

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime break the
delicate quantum superposition

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:90%
between particles.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And this gives rise
to consciousness."

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:10%
The theory was first
introduced in the 1990s

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:10%
by physicist Roger Penrose
and anesthesiologist, Stuart

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:10%
Hameroff, but was
believed to be unstable

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:10%
and was therefore, regarded
as a fringe theory at best.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
But now, "New Scientist"
reports the theory has

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
been put to the
test, writing, quote,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
"Experiments show
that anesthetic drugs

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:84%
reduce how long tiny
structures found in brain cells

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
can sustain suspected
quantum excitations.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
As anesthetic switches
consciousness on and off,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the results may implicate
these structures,

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
called microtubules, as a nexus
of our conscious experience."

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:10%
In one experiment,
Jack Tuszynski

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Alberta shone blue light

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:10%
on microtubules, the
hollow skeletal structure

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:10%
inside plant and animal
cells, to see how they react.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
The light was caught in the
microtubules then re-admitted,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
a process called delayed
luminescence, which they say

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
is comparable to how the human
brain processes information,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and they argue could explain
the fundamental workings

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:90%
of the brain and consciousness.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
The second part
of the experiment

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
was to repeat it, but in
the presence of anesthetic.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
The anesthetic suppressed
the delayed luminescence

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
in the microtubules,
meaning the light was

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
re-emitted faster after
the anesthetic shut down

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.590 align:middle line:90%
the microtubule.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:90%
So what does it all mean?

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Tuszynski believes that
if turning consciousness

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
on and off via
microtubules, that

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:84%
could be the beginning
of our consciousness.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:10%
However, Fred Alan Wolf,
physicists, lecturer and author

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:10%
of "Taking the Quantum Leap,"
is skeptical about the role

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:10%
of microtubules.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow, I don't feel
microtubules are the final

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:90%
answer, if at all the answer.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the emission of
the light that has nothing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to do with consciousness,
that maybe we're

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
knocking out the microtubules
by putting anesthesia onto them.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So that was the hypothesis,
the guess, the time together

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of the timing of the
emission of re-admitted light

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to add a seizure
to consciousness.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:90%
So how would you prove it?

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
interesting concept.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Who knows whether
it's right or not.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I doubt if it's right.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
It's too simple.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> As someone who has studied
consciousness for decades,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
what does Fred Alan Wolfe
think is the answer?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What consciousness is
is very difficult to say.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:84%
A better line of
research would be

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
to try to determine
what consciousness does.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually
point to things that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
are happening that
we can attribute

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.245 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness itself?

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Much more testing is needed
on the microtubule hypothesis.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Even to Tuszynski himself
told "New Scientist,"

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
quote, "We're not at the
level of interpreting

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
this physiologically,
saying, yeah, this

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:90%
is where consciousness begins.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
But it may."
