00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> A groundbreaking new study
suggests that commonly used

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory drugs
and steroids may cause pain

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.570 align:middle line:90%
to become chronic.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Could this lead to
a dramatic paradigm

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
shift in how pain is
managed and prevented?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.900 align:middle line:10%
For the vast majority
of people in acute pain,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
taking an over-the-counter
anti-inflammatory,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
such as ibuprofen, is the
usual course of action.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation has for decades
been seen as a cause of pain,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and its control the goal
of patients and doctors.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
A new study suggests, however,
that inflammation may actually

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
be necessary to prevent
pain from becoming chronic.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Given today's
overwhelming prevalence

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of chronic pain,
pain that persists

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.270 align:middle line:84%
for more than three
months, scientists

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
have lately been
turning their focus

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to studying the process by
which acute pain transitions

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
into more lasting and
debilitating pain.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Researchers at McGill
University recently

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:84%
completed a study in which
they studied this process

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:90%
using several methods.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:84%
First, they looked at
patients with lower

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:90%
back and facial pain.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Upon analysis of their
immune cell samples,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
the scientists were
surprised to find

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that those whose pain resolved
showed an intense spike

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
in the activity of
inflammatory genes

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
during the acute pain stages,
which then rapidly diminished

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:90%
within three months.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Researchers then
conducted an animal study

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
in which they treated mice
with various pain medications,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and found that
those who received

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
steroids or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatories eventually

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:84%
developed chronic pain,
while those treated

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
with other kinds of pain drugs,
such as lidocaine, did not.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the team examined data
from a large group of people,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and found that those who
took anti-inflammatories

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
had almost double the chance
of developing chronic pain

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
than those who took no
drugs or other drugs that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:90%
didn't suppress inflammation.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The findings strongly suggest
that our immune system's

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
natural inflammatory response
may help the body resolve pain,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and taking drugs that
suppress this natural process

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:90%
does just the opposite.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
An important note
is that researchers

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
believe that most
of the harm comes

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:84%
from long-term use
of these drugs.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
While some experts urge
caution in this interpretation

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and are calling for
further clinical study,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
many are heralding the
findings as groundbreaking.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Thomas Buchheit
of Duke University

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
told "The New York Times,"
quote, "This is absolutely

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.420 align:middle line:90%
a paradigm shift.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%
There is this unspoken rule--

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
if it hurts, take an
anti-inflammatory.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And if it still hurts,
put a steroid on it."

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But, he said, the study
shows that, quote,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
"We have to think
of healing and not

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:90%
suppression of inflammation."

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Massimo Allegri,
lead author of the study,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
told the American Association
for the Advancement of Science,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:84%
quote, "The biggest
clinical implication

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
is a complete reconsideration
of both prevention strategies

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and treatments."

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:10%
While further research
is forthcoming,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:10%
this study does seem to
provide convincing evidence

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:10%
of the body's
innate intelligence

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:10%
for healing, and the
importance of allowing it

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:10%
to do so without interference.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.170 align:middle line:10%
