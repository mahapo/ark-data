>> Ancient footprints buried
for thousands of years are

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.670 align:middle line:10%
revealing their true
date of creation,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.460 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years
earlier than we thought,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.310 align:middle line:10%
shaking up the
conventional timeline.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Could this validate Hopi oral
histories of ancient ant men?

White Sands National
Park in New Mexico

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
today is mostly chalky
white desert and sand dunes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But thousands of years ago, this
was a temperate zone centered

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:84%
around the massive
ancient Lake Otero, filled

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.300 align:middle line:84%
with flourishing
plants, wildlife,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and now we can confirm, humans.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Ancient footprints,
originally discovered in 2009,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.690 align:middle line:84%
have been radiocarbon dated to
be from 21,000 to 23,000 years

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Previous estimates of human
habitation in this area

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:90%
were 13,000 to 16,000 years ago.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Ancient stone tools footprints
and rock layers are difficult,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:10%
if not impossible, to date,
but scientists have found seeds

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:10%
from ancient spiral ditch grass
mingled with some footprints.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Those seeds were able
to be carbon dated,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
proving humans were in the area
and thriving thousands of years

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%
earlier than previously thought.

Jack Cary, researcher and
author of "Paranormal Planet"

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:10%
on the significance
of this discovery.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a huge point to
shove back human migration.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:84%
That means that
you're going to have

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite everything
that's associated

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
in our science related
to human migration.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
That is a huge problem
for our anthropologists

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and for accepted
science as a whole.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
As investigators into
ancient mysteries,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:84%
this is one of
the biggest things

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that we could ever
discover because now, we

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:84%
have absolute, inarguable
proof that humans were there

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
at this exact period of time.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are investigators of
ancient mysteries so excited

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:90%
about this find?

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the same
area, the same place,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and the same time that the
Hopi Indians claimed that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the so-called Ant People
took them underground during

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a massive global cataclysm
because the world basically

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
caught fire, according
to their ancient,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:90%
historical oral traditions.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And this same event,
strangely enough,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
can be found in
the Book of Enoch

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
when he describes
a cometary impact.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
All of this would date back to
around the same time period.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember
that in Hopi language,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
"Anu" means ant and
"Naki" means friend.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So the word Anunnaki to the
Hopi means "ant friends."

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was these ant friends
who twice took them underground,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
the second being when the
last Ice Age actually melted,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:84%
creating a global flood
that has been recorded

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:90%
in ancient histories worldwide.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have
radiocarbon dated proof

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that there was, in fact, human
habitation in the right place,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
at the right time to make
those oral histories viable.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we know about the
area where the footprints were

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
found?

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Along with these
human footprints,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
they've also discovered quite
a bit of Ice Age megafauna

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
in the form of footprints, in
the form of mammoth prints,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
saber tooth cat, and quite a
few other animals dating to that

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:90%
same time period.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So this was an area
for these people

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
that had a readily available
and numerous food source.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
There was plenty
of water available.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
this appears

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to have been a
temperate climate zone.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
For many researchers into
the ancient mysteries,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
they will tell you that
ice ages are cyclical,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that that is one of the great
secrets of the mystery schools,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and that that was
encoded in a lot

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:90%
of ancient, ancient cultures.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have an example
of a major global Ice Age

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
occurring and people still
being able to survive

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in the southwestern part
of the United States.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:90%
That's valuable information.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>> How does this finding affect
what we thought we knew about

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the past, and how will it
impact the study of archaeology

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to change a
lot of the encrusted dogma

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that's in our established
circles of academia.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have to accept
the fact that this migration

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.280 align:middle line:90%
took place at this point.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:90%
They cannot argue against it.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
they're going to have

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to rewrite a large portion of
what they believe to be true.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's in these gaps
that we as investigators

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
into ancient mysteries believe
that we have the information

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to fill in, so it's
an exciting time.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:10%
