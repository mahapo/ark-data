00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Will UFO disclosure be
coming to you this summer?

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.910 align:middle line:90%
The US government says yes.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.860 align:middle line:90%
But some experts disagree.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:10%
A 180-day countdown
to disclosure

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:10%
has reportedly begun,
and many people

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:10%
may not have even noticed it.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The recently signed relief
and government funding bill

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:84%
included the Intelligence
Authorization Act.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And tucked within that act
was a committee comment

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:10%
directing the Director
of National Intelligence

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:10%
along with heads of other
intelligence agencies

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:10%
to submit a report,
quote, "within 180

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.050 align:middle line:10%
days of the date of
enactment of the act

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:10%
to the Congressional
intelligence

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:10%
and Armed Services Committees on
unidentified aerial phenomena,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:10%
also known as anomalous
aerial vehicles,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:10%
including observed
airborne objects that

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:10%
have not been identified."

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:10%
This committee comment
instructs the Director

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:10%
of National
Intelligence to include

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:10%
a detailed analysis of all
unidentified aerial phenomena

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
collected or held
by the US government

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:10%
as well as a detailed
analysis by the FBI.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope, who
worked for the UK'S

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:10%
Ministry of Defense
investigating

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:10%
UFO's, on what this all means.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The requirement is
very wide-ranging--

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:10%
calls for a report from Director
of National Intelligence

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:10%
to various Congressional
committees, essentially

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:10%
Intelligence and Armed Services.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And the first
question is, they want

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to know who knows what
across government, military,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and the intelligence community
and an assessment of where

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
we are with the
phenomenon right now.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in our airspace?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> But what will
we actually learn?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Will it all be declassified?

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:10%
>> The difficulty is
that the requirement is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:10%
for an unclassified report, but
one which may have a classified

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.350 align:middle line:10%
annex.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So the danger here is that
the media and the public

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
will just get a very bland,
unclassified summary.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And the really interesting
stuff will only

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
go to these
Congressional committees

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because it will be
highly classified.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> How far back does this go?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Will we learn about Roswell
and other famous UFO sightings?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The focus is very
much on the present day,

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
the ongoing series of incursions
into restricted military

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
airspace.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I think that's
certainly going

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to have to include the Tic
Tac incident, the USS Nimitz

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.300 align:middle line:90%
encounter.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're going to
go right back to things

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
like Roswell or not,
I very much doubt.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly,
Senator Marco Rubio

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
said he would almost rather
this was extraterrestrial.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Because he said if
it's Russia or China,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
the idea that an
adversary has made

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
this quantum leap in technology
is highly disturbing.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:10%
>> But have we seen
anything like this before?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been previous
Congressional hearings on this.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now you'd have to go back
to the '60s for that.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a
report from Director

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:84%
of National Intelligence
consulting Secretary of Defense

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:84%
but also people like
the FBI Director,

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
others as appropriate.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
But there's a long way to go.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't have to
be out till late June,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and a lot may happen
between now and then.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> This comes on the heels
of the recently formed

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Unidentified Aerial
Phenomenon Task Force,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
who will probably bear the
responsibility of writing this

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Now they've been set
up for some months now.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
They are investigating
sightings.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But they'll also be
the ones, I'm sure--

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
the subject matter experts--

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:90%
drafting this report.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Given that they have
been working on this,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
one suspects, for a
while, don't be surprised

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
if the report comes in
before the deadline.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:10%
>> But John DeSouza, former FBI
agent and author of the book

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:10%
"Extra-Dimensionals,"
has a different take.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:10%
He says the committee
comment doesn't carry

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:10%
the full weight of a law, and--

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:10%
>> This story is a fake, and it
is associated with a group that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:10%
I call the UAP Faker Group.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a large
psychological operation meant

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to take over ufology
and to guide us

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.100 align:middle line:90%
towards fake alien invasion.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's all about.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, why would
they fake an alien invasion?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The ultimate goal of the
UAP Faker Group is ultimately

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring us towards this fake
alien invasion so that they can

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
establish their final complete
control over humanity through

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.105 align:middle line:84%
these alien visitors that
supposedly will exist.

00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether we are about to learn
the truth this summer or pieces

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of the truth, one
thing is for sure.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The idea of disclosure
is becoming a mainstream

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:10%
