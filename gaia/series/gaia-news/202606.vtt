>> An historic observatory,
which played a key role in UFO

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.570 align:middle line:10%
communication, has collapsed.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Will this spell the end for
interstellar UFO outreach?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.180 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
The iconic Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:90%
has collapsed on itself.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The 1,000 foot wide radio
telescope, built in 1963,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
had played a key role in
the astronomical discoveries

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:90%
for years.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The observatory is perhaps,
best known for the 1974 Arecibo

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Message, an interstellar
communication sent to the star

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
cluster M13 to demonstrate
the human capability

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
of communication with
extraterrestrials.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
The observatory had fallen
into disrepair over the years.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:84%
In August, a cable snapped
causing a 100-foot gash

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:90%
on the receiver platform.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
In November, a
main cable snapped,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
leading the National Science
Foundation to decommission

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:90%
the famous observatory.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:10%
On December 1st,
the 900-ton receiver

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
fell onto the reflector
dish, effectively destroying

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:10%
the observatory.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and chief photo and
video analyst for the Mutual

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:10%
UFO Network, Marc D'Antonio,
reflects on the observatory's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.815 align:middle line:10%
history and significance.

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So Arecibo has been a
mainstay in the astronomical

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:90%
community for many years.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe hard to believe,
but Arecibo was actually

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
first constructed as an
intercontinental ballistic

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:90%
missile defensive site.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
An installation
to help us prevent

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:90%
an attack, oddly enough.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it became
a civilian site

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.680 align:middle line:84%
where it then began making
strides in astronomy.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And it discovered, for instance,
that the planet Mercury, which

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970 align:middle line:84%
we thought was locked to the
sun with the same face facing

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
the sun all the time as it
went around the sun once

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:90%
every 88 days.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
it's not fully locked.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.880 align:middle line:84%
It actually has a
rotation of its own.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that was an
interesting discovery.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, a very crucial
discovery for the solar system.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In 1974, astronomers
decided it was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
worthwhile to show that
humans could send messages

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:90%
to the stars.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to send a message out.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And the message that we wanted
to send out was, look, hi.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:90%
We're from Earth.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:10%
And basically, it was a
short little blocky message.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:10%
It looked like a video
game to most people

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:10%
looking at the image
of what went out.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:10%
However, to an
advanced civilization,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:10%
they would have got
information like we're humans.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:10%
This is where we're
located in the galaxy.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:10%
Here's how many planets are in
our solar system, et cetera,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:10%
And it was, sort of, a greeting
card sent to the cosmos.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Since it was so damaged, was
the observatory worth saving?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Arecibo was one of only a few
installations that could also

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.620 align:middle line:10%
do something else, which
was very important.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:10%
And that was up
in the reflector,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:10%
up in that receiver array, up
above the dish down below--

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:10%
that receiver array
could actually

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:10%
transmit down into the dish,
which could send out radar.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And that radar could get
imagery in very high resolution.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Something that the other
antennas around the world

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:90%
can't do.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And we have to make up
for it by using things

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:10%
like the Deep Space
Network, which

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:10%
includes things like the
Goldstone radar antenna

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:10%
and other antennas
around the world.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:10%
And then through a process
called very long baseline

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:10%
interferometry, we
combine all those signals

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:10%
into a final image.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
technology is sort of where

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
radio astronomy is heading.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Because now we can make
use of multiple telescopes

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to bring us an image,
rather than just one.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:90%
The loss of Arecibo, it hurts.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
However, we do have other
ways to accomplish the goals.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And the science will continue.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:10%
>> The loss of Arecibo
is a blow to astronomy,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:10%
but humankind will continue
to reach out to space.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
