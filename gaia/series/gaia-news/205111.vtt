00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Occultism, meditation,
channeling, mediumship,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Eastern religions.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The rise in the West
of all these and more

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
can be traced back to one
woman, the enigmatic Helena

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky, who we are
celebrating this Women's

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:90%
History Month.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Madame Helena
Blavatsky is widely

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
considered the 19th century's
most famous occultist

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and a godmother of
the New Age movement.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Her influence on all of
modern spirituality cannot be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
overestimated, as she played
a pivotal role in bringing

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
to the West everything we
think of today as a part

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
of alternative
spiritual culture.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Born of noble parents in
Russia, she came to the US

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
in 1873 after
traveling the globe

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
and studying with great
hidden masters in the East.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:10%
Mitch Horowitz, historian
of alternative spirituality

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:10%
and author of "Occult
America," on Blavatsky.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Madame HP Blavatsky was the
co-founder of the Theosophical

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:10%
Society.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:10%
She was a world traveled
Russian noble woman who appeared

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:10%
in the West in the 1870s.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:10%
And her intention was
to uncover what she

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:10%
called an occult philosophy.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
She introduced Mysticism,
Buddhism, Hinduism,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:84%
other faiths, ways of looking
at the world to the West.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
She was an absolute
revolutionary,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
helped instigate the
independence movement in India.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.098 align:middle line:84%
The list of her accomplishments
could go on for many pages.

00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the most
extraordinary women

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of the 19th century.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1875, Blavatsky founded
the Theosophical Society,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which marked the official
starting point of the modern

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:90%
spiritual revival.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The principle behind
theosophy is the unfettered

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:10%
exploration of all religious
and spiritual ideas.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The motto of the
theosophical movement,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
as brought by Madame Blavatsky,
is there is no religion higher

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:90%
than truth.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So the search is a
search that's plural,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that needs to encompass all
religions, methods, systems.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And all should be
equally honored

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
as repositories of truth.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Madame Blavatsky was also
widely known for bringing

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.588 align:middle line:90%
occultism to the West.

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>> When we use the
word occult today,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:10%
we're usually referring to
hidden philosophies and ideas,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:10%
spiritual ideas that
predate the Christian world.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And that usage really came
from Madame Blavatsky.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:10%
She reintroduced the term
occult, or occultism,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:10%
as a universal
philosophy from which all

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:10%
our modern faiths emerged.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> As the first Westerner
to take Buddhist vows,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Madame Blavatsky was hugely
influential in helping to turn

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Americans and Europeans
toward Eastern religions

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and philosophies.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Before Madame Blavatsky,
it wasn't commonly understood

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:10%
among Westerners that the
Eastern world had its own vast

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:10%
religious traditions and
practices and mythologies

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:10%
and parables that were every
bit as rich and ancient,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:10%
or more so, than those
found in the Western world.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And Madame Blavatsky really
brought that to our attention

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:90%
as a culture.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what made Madame
Blavatsky such a force?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Her abilities, her courage,
her capacity to get things

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
done, to upend and
change the world,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
there was something greater
than met the eye about Madame

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Blavatsky.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.232 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the reasons why
we still talk about her today

00:04:00.232 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and why she's still the
subject of controversy today.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> As a dynamic figure, Madame
Blavatsky also generated

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:90%
a great deal of controversy.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there's no escaping
the fact that Madame Blavatsky

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
was accused of being a kind
of charlatan or a fake medium

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:90%
or a carnival performer.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And the arguments
and the controversies

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
about these things raged back
and forth during her lifetime.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.000 align:middle line:84%
She could seem to create this
imaginary mythos about herself.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Other times, she could
treat real world problems

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and real world situations with
such pragmatism and ability

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and capacity that she
seemed to understand

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the workings of human
events and human nature

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
better than most people
did at that time and today.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
She was a mass of
contradictions and she can't

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:90%
be categorized in any easy way.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite the controversy,
Madame Blavatsky gained a huge

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
following among artists,
writers, philosophers,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and
seekers of all kinds.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Among them was
Mahatma Gandhi, who

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
met Blavatsky at a
young age and often said

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:84%
that her influence
on him helped pave

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the way for the Indian
independence movement.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Madame Blavatsky's influence
on alternative spirituality was

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
as seismic as George
Washington's influence

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
on the founding of
the United States.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Both movements
presumably would have

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
occurred without
either individual,

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.887 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know
for sure and we

00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
don't know what they
would have looked like.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:84%
If you subtract Madame
Blavatsky from modern history,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
we'd probably be living
in a very different

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
looking world right now.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The impact made by Blavatsky
is even more significant when

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.540 align:middle line:84%
considering she was a woman
living in the 19th century.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to remember
that when Madame Blavatsky

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
first came to the US
in the early 1870s,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
most Americans had never even
seen a woman speak in public

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
before, much less be
written about in the press,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
be an object of fascination,
be the author of books herself.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Even if Madame
Blavatsky had been

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.418 align:middle line:84%
a more traditional
religious figure,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:90%
she would have been pioneering.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that she was
awakening the Western world

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
to esoteric philosophy
and was a woman

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
made her a trailblazer
in multiple ways.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So this Women's
History Month,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
we owe a debt of gratitude
to Madame Helena Blavatsky

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:84%
for paving the way to a deeper
understanding of our world.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:90%
