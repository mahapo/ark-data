>> Can plant medicines heal
longstanding sociopolitical

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.550 align:middle line:10%
conflicts?

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.560 align:middle line:84%
A new study brought
together groups

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:84%
with a deep-rooted
hatred of one another

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:90%
for an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the solution
for a more peaceful world?

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:90%

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Plant medicines, including
ayahuasca and psilocybin

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
from magic mushrooms,
have become breakthrough

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic modalities for
treating depression, anxiety,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and addiction as taboos
around psychedelics

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
fade and scientists study
their effects in sanctioned

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:90%
clinical settings.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, a group of scientists
from the US, UK, and Israel

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
have begun to look at ayahuasca
as a tool for resolving

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:90%
intercultural conflict.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:10%
By bringing together Israelis
and Palestinians for a group

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:10%
ceremony, the researchers
looked for signs

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:10%
of reconciliation and intergroup
contact between the subjects.

Dr. Maya Shetreat is a
neurologist and herbalist

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:10%
specializing in
plant medicine and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic assisted therapy.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:10%
She had this to say
about the recent study.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:10%
>> We should definitely be
able to experience significant

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:10%
shifts in identity politics
because we know that

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:10%
psychedelic medicines like
ayahuasca or psilocybin have

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:10%
these ego-dissolving properties
that change the way our brains

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:10%
see us, see our identity, and
kind of perceive us as being

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:10%
separate from one another.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, it's
possible that any kind

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of identity issues, whether
it be political or otherwise

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
could be more in a
place of resolution

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
because people can
see past differences.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Results of this recent study
proved to be profound with

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
several participants reporting
visions in which they relive

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
trauma from the perspective
of those from the opposite

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And in one instance,
a participant

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
was able to embody
a single experience

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
from both perspectives.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:10%
But while these results
held significant weight

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:10%
for those involved,
how does this

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.936 align:middle line:10%
translate at a larger scale?

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You know we have
to ask the question,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is it really necessary for
everyone to be in ceremony

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and go through a psychedelic
experience in order to create

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:90%
change?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's an
argument that actually it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't take that many people.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has
to be in that role

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
and enter that liminal space.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
The people who are
called and the people

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
who are motivated to
engage with the medicine

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
have those revelations,
integrate, take action,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
and actually in that
way lead other people

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
to see those connections
that other people might not

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
be able to see.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a belief held by
many within the plant medicine

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
community that there is a
sentience in these plants that

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
has worked to form a bond
between the indigenous cultures

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and the modern Western world.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Are these plants trying
to communicate and work

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
with us to actively heal our
collective consciousness?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So yes, I do think that
plant medicines like the ones

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about,
like psychedelics,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
do have some intention in their
desire to be in relationship

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
with humans, and that's why
they emerge in this way.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In modern society, we are
bombarded with constant streams

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
of information from the many
channels of communication we

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:90%
have access to.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But within that, comes a
deluge of competing values

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and viewpoints
vying to be heard.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
How can plant medicine
ceremonies and studies

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
like these help human
communication in this era?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that this study in
particular really demonstrates

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:10%
that engaging with psychedelics,
whether it even be through

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:10%
microdosing or macrodosing, may
be able to help draw people out

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:10%
of that black-and-white
oppositional polarized way

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:10%
of being, and help them
come back into that sense

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:10%
of connection and see beyond
the differences that we have.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's a really
profound study in that way.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.691 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's very hopeful.

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> As scientists continue
to study the myriad of ways

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.850 align:middle line:84%
in which plant medicines are
able to heal psychological

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
trauma and rifts
between global cultures,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
it will be interesting to see
how these studies manifest

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
into potential solutions and
how they will be received within

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:90%
the mainstream culture.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
For now, at least we
can see their efficacy

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
within small groups willing
to participate and open

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
their minds to new outcomes
toward peace building.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.416 align:middle line:10%
