>> Intermittent fasting has
become popular for health

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.460 align:middle line:10%
and weight loss.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610 align:middle line:10%
But could fasting also be
a highly effective tool

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:10%
for fighting and
reversing cancer?

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Across the world,
nearly every culture

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
has a tradition of fasting.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But in our modern lives, we've
created a world of surplus.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And with it, a constant
and easily satiated hunger.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And with this excess
food, our society

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
has become plagued by
diseases of excess.

of TrueNorth Health Foundation,
a therapeutic clinic

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
for water-only fasting that
helps patients suffering

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:10%
from a range of
illnesses, including

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:10%
hypertension, inflammation,
autoimmune disorders,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:10%
and cancer.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.620 align:middle line:10%
>> And we've gone from being
criminal quacks to cutting edge

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:10%
researchers, because this
idea of fasting has definitely

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:10%
gained some popular support.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
We think very different.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:84%
We believe that there is
a cause of real health.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And there is a cause for health.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And the cause is
healthful living.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So we focus on diet,
sleep, exercise.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And we use fasting to undo the
consequences of dietary excess

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the conditions
that respond best to fasting

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.138 align:middle line:84%
are the conditions caused by
dietary excess, so obesity,

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and high blood pressure,
cardiovascular disease, type 2

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:84%
diabetes, autoimmune diseases,
and certain forms of cancer,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
including lymphoma.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Studies have shown
that fasting acts to help

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:10%
the body's natural ability to
destroy dead or disease cells,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:10%
a process called autophagy.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, doctors have
begun to study how

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:10%
fasting protocols in
conjunction with drugs,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:10%
such as chemotherapy, can
improve the efficacy of cancer

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
treatment.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It turns out that autophagy
is that process the body uses

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of intracellular
debris, aging cells,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and cancer cells.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that fasting
is one of those things that

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.817 align:middle line:10%
may profoundly enhance
autophagy in not just humans,

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:10%
but also in other animals.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:10%
In fact, rats, if you do
periodic fasting with rats,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:10%
you can double their lifespan,
everything else being equal.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that's
very interesting and promising.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
we have what I would

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
consider definitive
research on the issue.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly raises one of
the mechanisms by which fasting

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:90%
may also be effective.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You get weight loss from
fasting, about a pound a day.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:10%
It's probably the
most efficient way

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:10%
of mobilizing not just
weight, but specifically fat,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:10%
and preferentially visceral fat.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out the amount
of visceral fat mobilized

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%
in fasting is preferential.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the most
efficient way shown today

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
at preferentially
mobilizing visceral fat,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
the type of fat associated with
inflammation and ill health.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Goldhamer stresses the
importance of a holistic

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and healthy lifestyle approach
after seeing positive results

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
from fasting regimens, a
concept that is often absent

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:90%
in mainstream medicine.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You can get people
to live healthfully.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.753 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't fast,
many of these conditions

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:90%
will begin to improve.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We've noticed that
recently, because we're

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:90%
booked out for several months.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so people can't
come in right away.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll work
with our doctors

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
through our
telemedicine practice.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And they'll work
with these doctors.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And annoyingly, they're
often getting well

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:90%
before we even get to them.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And because health results
from healthful living.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
It's diet, sleep, exercise.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
These are the dominant
factors that promote health.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Fasting is a useful
tool as a facilitator

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to speed that process.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fairness,
sometimes people

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have done the diet
and lifestyle,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:90%
but they're still struggling.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, fasting
can be a very important tool,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
but allowing things to
happen more quickly.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Goldhamer's clinic offers
free consultations to potential

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
candidates for
long-term water fasts,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and will continue to conduct
research into the therapeutic

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
benefits of fasting for
treating chronic illness.
