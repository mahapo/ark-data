00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.150 align:middle line:10%
>> 2021 has been a momentous
year for UFOs, ufology,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.100 align:middle line:10%
and possible disclosure.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's in store for 2022?

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.625 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:84%
2021 has been called
the year of the UFO,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
with UFO news seemingly
breaking every month.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't stopped yet,
with the Pentagon recently

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
announcing the formation of the
Airborne Object Identification

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and Management
Synchronization Group

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
to replace the UAP Task Force.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
And remember, we started
the year with the countdown

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:10%
to the much anticipated UAP
report from the US government.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:10%
To break down the events of the
past year and provide context,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:10%
Nick Pope worked for the
UK's Ministry of Defense

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:10%
on the UFO phenomenon.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:10%
>> 2021 has been a huge
year for the UFO topic.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The big story, of course, was
the preliminary assessment

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of unidentified aerial
phenomena produced

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
by the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
It said that a lot
of these sightings

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
could not be explained, even
after rigorous investigation

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:90%
by the military.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It said that some of
these cases appeared

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
to display the hallmarks
of advanced technology.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Two examples of that
are signature management

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and a degree of
radiofrequency energy.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was big.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And of course, work
is continuing, all

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:10%
sorts of follow-up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:10%
>> This year saw a number of
senior government officials

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:10%
speak out on the issue of UFOs
and potential extraterrestrial

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:10%
life.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> 2021 absolutely saw an uptick
in the number of senior people

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
speaking out on this.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
We had former Director of
National Intelligence John

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Ratcliffe.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
We had former CIA Director
James Woolsey, DNI Avril Haines,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
head of NASA spoke, Jeff Bezos
spoke, and a number of others.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's
unprecedented, I think.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
One has had people
like Luis Elizondo,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of course, speaking out
on this for some time now.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing now is there's

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:84%
almost a sort of validation
of a lot of that, when

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the senior folks pile
in and say, yes, there

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:90%
is something to all this.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:10%
And who am I to rule out
even the extraterrestrial

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:10%
hypothesis?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920 align:middle line:10%
>> We've recently reported
on Senator Kirsten

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:10%
Gillibrand's amendment to the
National Defense Authorization

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:10%
Act, which included multiple
groundbreaking UFO-related

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:10%
topics.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:84%
That amendment will be taken
up in the National Defense

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Authorization Act and, in
an increasingly rare moment

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of bipartisanship, featured
several Republican co-sponsors

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and a call for open reporting.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Senator Gillibrand
and Senator Marco Rubio,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
who subsequently endorsed her
amendment and put his name

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
on it too, have said that
yes, whatever Congress gets,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:84%
which will be classified, there
must be at least an annual

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
report for the
public and the media,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
which will be
unclassified, of course,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
as with the June 2021
preliminary assessment.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But at least people
will get something.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
That's probably more than
the Pentagon wanted to do.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Pope started
studying the UFO phenomenon

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:90%
for the UK's Ministry in 1991.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Has there been a societal shift
when it comes to UFO phenomena

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:90%
over the past 30 years?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> A critical mass has
built up on this issue.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, certainly,
I don't know quite

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
how it plays into
the wider public.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But in the circles
in which I move,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
there's an absolute
acceptance now

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that this is something that
was overlooked or stigmatized

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
for too long.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And the realization now, I
think, from within government,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:84%
from within Congress,
that this is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
a safety of flight
issue, a defense

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
issue, and a potential
national security challenge.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
The key takeaway
is that folks are

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
going to be taking
this more seriously

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:90%
than they have before.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> How can we sum up 2021?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And what can we look forward
to in 2022 and beyond?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>> As I look back at 2021, I
think it's a year of very solid

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:90%
progress.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
2022 will doubtless
see a ramping up

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
of the official research
and investigation program.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've got a lot
of fabulous resources

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and capabilities that
sit within the US.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they're no
good if you don't use them.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:84%
What has been
lacking is the will

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
to use these resources, these
capabilities, this expertise,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to use all that to
solve the UFO mystery.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot going on.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:90%
A lot happened in 2021.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot to look
forward to in 2022.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:10%
