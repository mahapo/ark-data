00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680 align:middle line:10%
>> A flurry of new research has
been pointing to one nerve that

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.170 align:middle line:10%
may just be the key to
true health and well-being.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.580 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.000 align:middle line:10%
The vagus, which comes from
the Latin word for wandering,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:10%
is the longest and most complex
nerve in the human body,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
traveling from the brainstem
all the way down to the colon.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Donese Worden is a
naturopathic medical doctor

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
who has been closely
following the research.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:10%
>> The vagus nerve is like
an information superhighway.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:10%
And it goes back and forth
from the brain to the organs,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:10%
and now we know it
also communicates

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:10%
with the microbiome.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It specifically really
works on talking

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
to the heart, the lungs,
the gut, and the brain.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:90%
And the feedback goes both ways.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we're upset about
something, if you feel hungry,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
you're short of breath,
your heart is beating fast,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
it's because of that
information traveling

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:84%
back up to the brain
from the nervous system

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
saying something--
something is up

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and we need to take care of it.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a smart
communication system.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.040 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
a gut reaction

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
or a visceral
reaction, it's really

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that reaction coming from the
signals from the vagus nerve.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Research is showing that the
vagus nerve exerts its greatest

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
function through its critical
role in the parasympathetic

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:90%
nervous system.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The parasympathetic
is the rest and digest.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the good one.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the part that activates
us to really repair the body.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And when we increase that vagal
activity and the vagal tone,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
our parasympathetic rest and
digest nervous system kicks in

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and we relax and
the body knows how

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself in that state.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The vagus has also been
shown to affect numerous other

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
systems in the body and has been
implicated in various health

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:10%
Experts have linked its
activity to symptoms in people

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:10%
with inflammatory bowel
disease, epilepsy, arthritis,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:10%
depression, anxiety, and
many other common ailments.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The vagus nerve has
to do with our emotions,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
positive or negative.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
our immune system,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
with our gut microbiome,
which has many implications

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%
in overall health.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It affects our heart,
our brain, and our lungs.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve is like
the homeostatic control

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:90%
of inflammation in the body.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So if the inflammation is
not shut off from the vagus,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
it may become chronic.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The most recent research on
the vagus nerve has been done

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
within the emerging new field
of bioelectronic medicine which

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
uses electricity to
manage chronic conditions,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:90%
often with great success.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:10%
The work in this field
has led to the development

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:10%
of cutting-edge vagus
nerve stimulation devices--

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.300 align:middle line:10%
some implanted,
others external--

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:10%
which have been used in
various neurological disorders.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:10%
The FDA has approved
several of these devices

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:10%
as non-pharmacological
treatments

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:10%
for brain diseases such as
epilepsy and depression.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The vagus nerve is a good
reminder of how electrical

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
our body really is.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Our body emits
electrical impulses,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and when we put electrical
impulses back in,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
it can change many things, from
our brain to our immune system

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to our lungs to our gut
health and our emotions, which

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
include anxiety, depression, and
other mental health conditions.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And that by
manipulating or working

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
with the electrical
part of our body,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
we can help it get back to
homeostasis or to balance.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:10%
>> While these stimulation
devices are quite promising,

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:10%
there are many other ways we
can affect our vagus nerve

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:10%
functioning without the
involvement of a doctor.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Some proven ways
are cold exposure.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can look
into cold showers,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:90%
putting your face in cold water.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But cold exposure activates
that vagus nerve pathways.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Other ways are deep
and slow breathing.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.970 align:middle line:84%
It's been shown that deep, slow
breathing decreases anxiety.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it activates the
vagus nerve system, and that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.430 align:middle line:84%
activates the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Your vagus nerve is
connected to your vocal cords

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and the muscles in the
back of your throat.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So singing, humming, gargling,
and chanting actually

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
help activate and
stimulate your vagus nerve.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Other natural ways to
stimulate your vagus nerve

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
include taking probiotics,
exercising, receiving massage,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:90%
and socializing.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Researchers and
practitioners like Dr. Worden

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:84%
are excited about all
the different ways

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
in which we can work with this
critical part of our bodies.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:10%
