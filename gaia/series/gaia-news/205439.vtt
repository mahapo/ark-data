00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.380 align:middle line:10%
>> In today's fast-paced world,
many of us feel that time is

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.960 align:middle line:10%
a luxury we just don't have.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen
if we had no way

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.100 align:middle line:90%
of telling the passing of time?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.210 align:middle line:10%
A group of volunteers isolated
in a French cave for 40 days

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.800 align:middle line:10%
recently found out.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:10%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:84%
This group of 15
French volunteers

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:84%
were part of a study
called Deep Time, which

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
set out to explore human
adaptability to isolation.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:10%
Christian Clot, an explorer
and the project director,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.668 align:middle line:10%
was also one of the volunteers.

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The main objective
for "Deep Time"

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:10%
mission was really to
understand how human beings,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:10%
a group of human beings,
can adapt when suddenly dive

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:10%
in a situation without one
of the most important things

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:10%
in our life, which is time.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
is time in our life.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
We're always watching
our watch or smartphone

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you're
out of time, you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:90%
don't have this information.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
What happened to brain?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
What happened for
the social situation?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
What happened for the genetic?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:84%
What happened for everything
you are as a human being,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
as a group?

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
This was merely to try
to understand that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The group of seven women
and eight men spent 40 days

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:10%
in a large cave in
southwest France,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:10%
where the temperature
was 50 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:10%
and the humidity 100%.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:10%
They had no phones,
clocks or means

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:10%
of communicating with
the outside world.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:10%
They did, however, have
plenty to occupy their time.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Inside the cave we had
a lot of things to do.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We had, of course,
scientific studies,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
some devices we had to
use, a lot of things

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
about how we were as a
human being inside the cave.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Our kind of work we had to
do is, of course, organizing

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
our camp, organizing everything
about toilets, about water,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:90%
about cooking.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It was the equivalent of
eight hours of work each day

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
per person.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:10%
>> While the participants had no
direct contact with the outside

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:10%
world, they were being closely
monitored by scientific

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:10%
equipment throughout
the 40 days.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The main work we had was
the studies about human beings

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:10%
and what were our
adaptation inside the cave.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:10%
So we had a small
piece we swallow

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.240 align:middle line:10%
to have the inside temperature,
the following of our heartbeat,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:10%
following of our movement with
a system called Actometer.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, we have
all about emotions.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
What were our emotions, our
perceptions, our understanding

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of the situation?

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We had the questionnaires
and things like that.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we had
equipment like EEG,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
which is able to monitor our
brain in fact, inside the cave.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
We had just before and
after entering the cave

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and after getting out
of the cave some MRI.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have thousands of
data now we have to analyze.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:10%
>> While all this scientific
data will take time to analyze,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:10%
what was the
experience itself like?

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The experience in itself was
at the beginning of it, hard.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
We were discovering
new situation.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We had, it was
cold, it was humid.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
But after some days, some
cycles, as we called them,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
we feel that we find solutions
and we were happy in the cave.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we arrive
at 32 days, 32 cycles.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And someone came and told
us, hey guys, it's the end.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:90%
You spent 40 days in the cave.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was unbelievable.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:10%
We didn't want to go outside,
because we had job to do.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So it was, well, I don't
want to go outside,

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:90%
I have to finish my work here.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened to the
volunteer sense of time?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to
analyze all the data,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:10%
but why suddenly we had an
average of 32 hours per day

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:10%
and not 24 hours no more.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge discovery we
have on this expedition.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>> What are researchers most
hoping to prove with this

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:10%
study?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We always thought as human
being that it's our biology

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:10%
will dictate us our rhythm.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, it's
not the biology.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It's our brain.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And mainly, most the brain of
one person is the team brain.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole team
works all together

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and finally this was a biggest
synchronizer than biology.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
We prove two things.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
First thing is, when you
are a group of people

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and you have a goal, you have a
reason, you have a perspective,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier
to face and to deal

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:90%
with a new kind of situation.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:90%
So we need to have a goal.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, we
need absolutely diversity.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you are alone,
you can't do anything.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Once all the
data is analyzed,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:10%
what could the applications be?

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> All human beings on Earth
right now will face new

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
challenges, new
kinds of situations.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And because of the climate,
because of technologies,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
because of a lot of
reasons will push us

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in new kinds of situations.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
more what happens in the brain

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
when these happen and how we
can help a human being to face

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:90%
these kind of conditions.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we consider
going to the moon or Mars.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:90%
This will be really important.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.470 align:middle line:10%
We'll have submarines,
persons working in the mine,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:10%
all these people
need to understand

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:10%
more will happen when
you are out of time.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:10%
>> So how did the volunteers
feel when they finally left

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:10%
the cave?

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We eventually got outside,
because it was the idea

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.030 align:middle line:84%
of the experimentation, and
then we saw the sun and we feel

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the hot of the sun on
our body and our skin.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:90%
And we saw trees.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was green, it was blue,
and all these kind of colors

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.130 align:middle line:90%
we do not have in the cave.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:90%
It was like a birth, you know.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:84%
We were like seeing
the world again.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:10%
>> While researchers
await the results,

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:10%
there's a good deal of
excitement around just what

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:10%
the data will show about humans'
seemingly impressive capacity

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:10%
for adaptation.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:10%
For new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:90%
