>> Exciting new study by a
leading research institute

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.400 align:middle line:10%
suggests that mental
intention can not only change

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:10%
the structure of water but may
even help stem cells to grow.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Simply the active intention
on water must have done

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.845 align:middle line:84%
something to make the stem
cells actually grow better.

The Institute of
Noetic Sciences or IONS

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:10%
is a leader in the
field of exploring

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
mind-matter interactions.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Their latest study
is the culmination

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
of a number of
other experiments,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
all suggesting that the act of
making an intention on water

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:90%
produces a measurable response.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Dean Radin is
the chief scientist

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:10%
at IONS who led the study.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In this experiment,
as in previous studies,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:10%
we asked three Buddhist monks
in the temple in Taiwan to focus

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:10%
their attention towards samples
of water with the intention

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:10%
that stem cells that were
grown with that water as part

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:10%
of the growth medium
would proliferate more.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:10%
And then we had controlled
water, same company,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:10%
same source since
the one that was not

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:10%
part of the experiment which
was set aside as a control.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:10%
So then the water was used
in a double blind fashion

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:10%
by a technician who
was growing the stem

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.460 align:middle line:10%
cells to create growth media
that these stem cells were

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:10%
put into.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And then they simply measured
over three days how much

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:10%
were the stem cells growing.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And they also took
other measures

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that are genetic
expression factors showing

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:90%
the health of the stem cells.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers were
astounded by the results.

00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What we found was significant
evidence that the stem cells

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
proliferated more, that the
genes that were expressed were

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with the idea that
they were actually healthier

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.995 align:middle line:90%
stem cells.

00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:09.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Just what makes these
results so significant?

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Stem cells are a part of
the human body which are called

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
pluripotent, which means that
they can turn into any other

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:90%
kind of cell.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's being used mostly
experimentally at this point

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
but for repair of
the human body.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Anything which makes adult stem
cells proliferate more and last

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.550 align:middle line:84%
longer is really
good because it's not

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:84%
so easy to make adult stem cells
live longer and be healthier.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So what this is
suggesting is that simply

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
the act of intention on water
must have done something

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to the water to make the stem
cells actually grow better.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:10%
One of the implications is that
wherever stem cells are being

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:10%
used, you want to train the
people who are growing the stem

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:10%
cells to maintain a
certain intention,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:10%
that these cells are going
to grow better and then see

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:10%
what happens.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And if it worked, well,
that would change everything

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because now it means
that anybody doing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
any kind of mental preparation,
not just stem cells

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
but anything, if they come
at it with an intention

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that this is going
to work better,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
well, it looks like
it will work better.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> IONS is currently planning
follow-up experiments

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to replicate the results
and explore further.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
For Dr. Radin, the
implications of this research

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.745 align:middle line:90%
are far-reaching.

00:03:29.745 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason why consciousness
is particularly interesting

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:10%
and why intention is interesting
is because a lot of people are

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:10%
spending a lot of time doing
things like praying for peace

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.317 align:middle line:10%
or praying for somebody else
to be well or praying for this

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:10%
or praying for that.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It's all about intention
that you want something

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to change in the world.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order for
that to work, it

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
requires from a
non-religious perspective

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness and intention
in particular does something.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It is causal, in which case
things like praying for peace

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
would make sense because
then it's not just

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
people comforting themselves
but they're actually

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.845 align:middle line:84%
changing something in
the physical world.
