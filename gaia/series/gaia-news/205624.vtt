Most of us take it
for granted, and yet,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.039 align:middle line:10%
as an influx of recent
studies show, when

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.620 align:middle line:10%
we learn to control
it, it can be the key

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.870 align:middle line:10%
not only to our
physical well-being,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:10%

transformation.

Breathwork is the conscious
awareness and control

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
of the breath through the
practice of various techniques.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:84%
While breath practices had
been incorporated for millennia

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:84%
in many religious and
spiritual traditions,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
they were largely
forgotten with the rise

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:90%
of the modern Western world.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:10%
Today however, we
are in the midst

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.710 align:middle line:10%
of a massive
resurgence of interest

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:10%
in these ancient practices.

Ben Stewart is a
filmmaker who has

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.438 align:middle line:10%
been researching and practicing
breathwork for years.

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:56.980 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN STEWART: We
always have breath.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:10%
It's free, and it's relegated
to the subconscious for the most

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:10%
part of our lives.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring it back
into the conscious realm,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
just the very act of bringing
awareness to the breath

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is something that augments
the experience of what

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:90%
the breath is doing to us.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
But also, just becoming
aware of your breath

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.430 align:middle line:84%
allows you to realize
how much we actually

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
hold our breath, how
interrupted and inconsistent

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
our breathing really is.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So breath work is bringing in
the idea of bringing awareness

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
before intention, pre
intention, bringing awareness

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:90%
to the breath.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the intention
could be just,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring more
awareness to the breath

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
for an extended period
of time, all the way to I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
want to heal some deeper traumas
that have been holding onto

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
or experience the
other side of whatever

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
the confines of what they
call the default mode

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
network, the confines of
everyday waking consciousness.

>> Dr. John Douillard is
the leading practitioner

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:10%
of our Ayurveda, the ancient
Indian system of medicine.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:10%
He has been
incorporating breathwork

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:10%
in his practice for decades.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN DOUILLARD: Breathwork
is really popular these days,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:10%
and for good reason.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:10%
You know, pranayama, the
word prana means breath.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the word
yama means to pause.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So there is something
really special about being

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
able to hold your breath for
extended periods of time.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
When you actually look at
the science behind kumbhaka

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
or breath retention,
it's actually

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
called intermittent hypoxia.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And intermittent
hypoxia has been

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
studied to increase
stem cells, it's

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:84%
been shown to increase
angio growth factors.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many different
breathwork techniques.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
From the ancient yogic
practice of alternate nostril

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
breathing to the more vigorous
modern styles, such as Wim

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Hof breathing, all
breathwork practices

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
consist of augmenting
inhale, exhale and retention.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:10%
Recent studies have
pointed to breathwork's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.623 align:middle line:10%
myriad physiological benefits.

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The main benefits
of pranayam techniques done

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
properly are things like really
fully oxygenating your tissue,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have
degenerative effects.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Nitric oxide, a Nobel
Prize-winning molecule,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.860 align:middle line:90%
a panacea molecule is released.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Hormones that rebuild the
nervous system, like EPO.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
It lowers blood sugar,
lowers blood pressure,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
it protects the endothelial
lining of your arteries,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
protects your genes
from expressing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:84%
negative traits that
happen as you age

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:90%
if your tissues are hypoxic.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> As the connector between
the mind and the body,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.310 align:middle line:84%
breath has also been shown to
exert a profound physiological

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It increases
neuroplasticity,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
so you change all the mental
emotional patterns of behavior,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
which is really the most
important reason why

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
we do both breathwork
in the first place,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:90%
because it changes our brain.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
It actually unravels old
mental emotional patterns

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that make us do the same
dumb stuff again and again.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:90%
It makes us conscious.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
any Vedic science,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
it's always about accessing some
level of full human potential,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
realizing that the
human body is actually

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
an instrument for
perceiving subtle energy.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And to actually refine
that instrument and fine

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
tune that instrument is all
about what pranayam does.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> For many practitioners, it
is this consciousness expansion,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
which is breastwork's most
transformative element.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.750 align:middle line:10%
>>STEWART: Nowadays,
it's really becoming

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:10%
this free auxiliary method
of doing what plant medicines

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and meditation was there to do.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You're augmenting all of
these gases inside the body

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:84%
so you can have an
altered experience

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
so you can step outside
of the confines of who

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.553 align:middle line:90%
and what you think you are.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> For those interested in
starting a breathwork practice,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
practitioners suggest choosing
one method that works for them

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and practicing it consistently.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Dr. John Douillard particularly
recommends a technique

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:90%
called Pratiloma in Ayurveda.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It has recently been studied
in hospitals under the name

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
inspiratory muscle
training, and found

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to have remarkable benefits
in heart, lung, respiratory

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.305 align:middle line:90%
and digestive conditions.

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>>DOUILLARD: You would
just take your fingers

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:10%
and partially close
your nostrils about 75%.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:10%
Basically, you take a
breath all the way in.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:10%
[INHALES]

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And then open up your
nostrils, let it out.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And again.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And open up your
nostrils, let it out.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.695 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's very vigorous.

00:05:42.695 --> 00:05:44.690 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you at the very
tippy top, let it out,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.005 align:middle line:84%
you feel your
diaphragm contract.

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Try it one more time.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.797 align:middle line:90%
Breath in all the way.

00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:51.842 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:05:51.842 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
All the way to the tippy
top, and underneath your rib

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
cage you'll feel your
diaphragm contracting maybe

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
That's forcing that
diaphragm to contract,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
pulling the air in, forcing
the rib cage to break open

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
all the rust and the
rigidity in your rib cage

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and forcing that's
become like 12 levers,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
massaging your heart and your
lungs 28,000 times per day.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
What I typically recommend is do
10 up to 30 of the Pratilomas.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
And then let it out.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:90%
10 of those to 30 of those.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the last, after the
last exhale, do a breath hold.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Just hold your
breath comfortably.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you feel
the urge to breathe,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
then go right back into
another round of Pratiloma.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you did three to five
sets of that two times a day

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
for a month, it'll
change your world.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Proponents of breathwork
have high hopes that it will

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
continue to be studied and
incorporated into standard

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STEWART: I'm really interested
in seeing how breathwork

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
can be looked at as the
fundamental platform

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
for all health no
matter what that it

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is, in my humble opinion,
it really is that.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be reintroduced
back into medicine.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think teaching
humans how to breathe

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
should come before
we teach people

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
any math, any geography,
anything else.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
We should be teaching our
children how to breathe.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
We need a lot more people
in their center, empowered.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:90%
