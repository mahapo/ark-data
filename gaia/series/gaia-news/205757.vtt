00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510 align:middle line:10%
>> A major development in
the treatment of depression.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.420 align:middle line:10%
A new study shows
psilocybin can actually

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:10%
grow connections
inside the brain

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:10%
without a hallucinogenic trip.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.905 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.530 align:middle line:10%
As we have previously
reported researchers

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.800 align:middle line:10%
have found that psilocybin,
the active ingredient

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
in psychedelic mushrooms,
can reduce major depressive

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:10%
disorder in humans.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But we have not known how it
works or how long it will last.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, a new study out
of Yale University

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
shows one dose of
psilocybin in mice

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
creates rapid and sustained
connections between neurons.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:10%
Steven Grant,
director of research

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:10%
at the Heffter
Research Institute,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:10%
a non-profit organization
which promotes research

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:10%
into hallucinogens
in the brain, has

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.132 align:middle line:10%
studied how drugs affect the
brain for nearly 50 years.

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:10%
>> So what they discovered
not only does a single dose

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:10%
of psilocybin produce the
formation of neuronal growth

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
as measured by what
are called spines--

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:10%
spines are little
nubby protrusions

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:10%
off of the branches
of the neuron

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:10%
that are associated with the
connections with other neurons.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So presumably, the more spines,
the more connections you have.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the study found that
psilocybin not only produced

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
growth in the number of spines,
but it persisted over a month.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's remarkable.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
One dose produces this
long lasting change

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.522 align:middle line:84%
in the ability of the neurons
to form new connections.

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How does psilocybin creating
spine formation work to relieve

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.202 align:middle line:90%
depression?

00:02:06.202 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The jump between spine
formation and relief of anxiety

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:90%
is a jump, it's a leap.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can't fill in
every single step there.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
these drugs are increasing

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the ability of neurons to
communicate with each other

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and form new connections,
which will then

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
form new patterns of brain
activity, which will then

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
form new patterns of
behavioral activity.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of depression,
for example, as being stuck,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
you're stuck in a place that's
aversive, things are anhedonic,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
you have low mood, how do you
get out of that, especially

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
if you don't think
anything is worthwhile?

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
What this study
suggests is there

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is a neurobiological process
that psilocybin kicks off

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that starts with the
formation of new connections

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that then will presumably
allow the person

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
to engage in new forms of
behavior and not be in the hole

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:90%
that they were in.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> By blocking the receptor
in the brain that receives

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic
effects of psilocybin,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the researchers made another
perhaps more important

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
discovery and may have
settled an ongoing debate.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a
debate in the field,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
whether the therapeutic effects
depend on the psychedelic

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is an active
controversy on the field.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
This study suggests
that spine formation

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is related to the
therapeutic effects

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and can occur in the
absence of a measure

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
of the psychedelic
effects in so far

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:90%
as we can measure it in mice.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
This study is
remarkable because it's

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:84%
a step in showing that you can
get some degree of dissociation

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.516 align:middle line:84%
between the psychedelic effects
and the therapeutic effects.

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> As someone who has studied
this for nearly 50 years,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
what does Steven Grant hope
these discoveries could mean

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.086 align:middle line:84%
for the future of psychedelics
to treat depression?

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> This will result in the
use of drugs that will have

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
a therapeutic effect very
rapidly that the person

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be on
a chronic drug regimen,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and that it produces
persistent therapeutic effects.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the findings of
this study were remarkable,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Steven cautions that this
study was done on mice.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:10%
Animal studies often translate
to humans but not always.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Much more testing
remains to be done,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and it will be hard to replicate
the same results in humans.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But this could be a major
step forward in understanding

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:90%
how plant medicine can heal us.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:10%
