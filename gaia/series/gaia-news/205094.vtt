00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390 align:middle line:10%
>> The mysterious world
of dreams has, thus far,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.880 align:middle line:10%
only been fully
accessible to one person--

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.020 align:middle line:10%
the dreamer.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Until now, with a recent
groundbreaking study,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
a new age of dream
research has just begun.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.745 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The lucid dream is
a state of being

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
aware that you're
dreaming and possibly

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
having some control
over what happens in it.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It is estimated that
some 50% of people

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
have had one,
especially in childhood.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have been studying
this phenomenon for decades

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but haven't been able
to adequately explain it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
because a person's recounting
of dreams upon waking

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:90%
is often unreliable.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But recently, scientists
have made a breakthrough

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
by showing that people
can both comprehend

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
questions and provide answers
to them all while they're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
dreaming.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
A team of international
researchers

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
studied 36 people with
the goal of finding a way

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with them
while they were dreaming.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:90%
The results were groundbreaking.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Charlie Morley is a dream
researcher who teaches people

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
how to lucid dream.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:10%
He had this to say about
the importance of the study.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Up to this point, there's
been no way to directly

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:10%
communicate to the lucid dreamer
while they're in the lucid

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:10%
dream.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.892 align:middle line:84%
You can give them
instructions before, you

00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
can speak to them
afterwards, but while they're

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
in the internal virtual reality
simulation of their own mind,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:90%
there's a blackout in comms.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
The brilliant thing
about this new study

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is that blackout
was broken through.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:10%
They could actually communicate
to the lucid dreamer

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:10%
while they were inside
the lucid dream.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> How exactly did they do this?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What they've discovered is
once you're in a lucid dream,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
you can actually direct
your physical eyes at will.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So using a form of
literal Morse code,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
flicking the eyes
left, right, up,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
down to indicate
certain responses,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
communicate with the dreamer

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:90%
while they were still asleep.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
How did they enter the dream?

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Three main different ways.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
One person said it came through
a car radio in the dream.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.732 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the radio
station changed

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and they could hear the
voice of the scientist.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Another person said it
was like the voice of God.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:90%
It just came down from the sky.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And another person said it
was like a narrating film.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They would then reply,
yes, I can hear you,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
by doing, you know, two
eye flicks to the left

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
or whatever code they had a
pre-decided to indicate yes.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, full-on
communication back and forth

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.775 align:middle line:10%
while the person is
still in the dream.

00:02:28.775 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Out of the 158 trials,
participants were able to give

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
correct answers about
18% of the time,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
which is quite
statistically significant.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:10%
The validity of the results
was strengthened by the fact

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:10%
that there were four
separate teams of researchers

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:10%
in four different
countries, all using

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:10%
slightly different techniques
and getting similar results.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Given these findings,
researchers like Charlie Morley

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
are excited about
the opportunities

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
for further exploration
and potential applications.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Up until this study,
lucid dreaming has been,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:10%
by definition, a solo activity.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:10%
You are literally inside a
three-dimensional projection

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:10%
by your own mind.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you're within this
three-dimensional projection,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:90%
you can do whatever you like.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
You can choose to
work with PTSD,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
you can choose to
ask big questions,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
you get the keys to the library
of the unconscious mind.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, anything you can
treat through hypnotherapy,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
you can also treat
through lucid dreaming.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Back the same way as
a hypnotist, brings

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
a thread of the conscious
mind down to the subconscious,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream,
you bring a threat

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
of the conscious into the
depths of the unconscious mind.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:10%
The cool thing
about this study is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:10%
it means that the lucid
dream state, which

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:10%
was up to this point
a completely solo, one

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:10%
person place, can now have
another individual involved.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
If we can have therapists being
able to talk to their clients

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
within a lucid dream,
guiding them, helping

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:84%
them to engage healing,
this could greatly

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
expediate the healing process
and the therapeutic journey.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the work that
I do with lucid dreaming

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:10%
is working with
military veterans.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of whom I work
with heavy PTSD trauma.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Could there be a day,
a few years from now

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
where I can be in the lab with
a heavily traumatized veteran

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
guiding them into
the lucid dream

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and then being able
to communicate to them

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.175 align:middle line:90%
say, OK, don't worry.

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:90%
This is just a lucid dream.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:90%
You're safe, I'm here with you.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I want you to move towards
the source of your fear.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wow.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.456 align:middle line:84%
That would be the next
level in trauma therapy.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Other research areas which
could come out of this study

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
include nightmare therapy,
memory processing, creativity,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.761 align:middle line:90%
and even self-healing.

00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There is burgeoning
research now, and in fact,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I just got a big grant to
be part of this research,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
to see if we can prove the
anecdotal claims that lucid

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
dreaming can be used to
treat physical ailments.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So there are dozens
of anecdotal claims

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
of people going
to the lucid dream

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and doing visualized healing or
affirmations or kind of hands

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
on Reiki to themselves
within the lucid dream,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:84%
leading to some sort
of placebo healing

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.997 align:middle line:84%
or spontaneous healing
in the waking state.

00:05:02.997 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
We know that anecdotally
there's never

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
been any scientific studies on
it, but those are coming soon.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's the
next big kind of frontier

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in lucid dreaming research.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.746 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the greater
implications of this research?

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
someone's dream world,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at a direct
expression of the internal

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:90%
environment of their own mind.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
With so many
therapeutic modalities

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
being based on the premise
of what's going on in here,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
there's no better
way to see what's

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
going on in here than to
look into someone's dreams.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
When you start
having lucid dreams,

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
you gain conscious access
to that dream world

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and can start to plant
seeds of possibility that

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
affect not only your dream
time, but your waking state

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.508 align:middle line:90%
experience too.

00:05:46.508 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> With this new study, we are
now one step closer to decoding

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the dream world
and using our time asleep

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:90%
to better our time awake.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.
