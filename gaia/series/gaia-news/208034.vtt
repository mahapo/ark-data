00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Jupiter and Neptune will
be in conjunction in Pisces.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.370 align:middle line:10%
This has not happened
in more than 160 years.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle line:84%
What this means for
humanity and the planet--

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.285 align:middle line:84%
>> There's going to be a lot
of love in the atmosphere.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Plus, how you should
greet this cosmic phenomenon.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter and Neptune will
soon be in conjunction,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
where the planets appear
to be close to each other

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%
when observed from Earth.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:10%
And they will be in
Pisces, something

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:10%
we have not seen since 1856.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer Mercedes
Arnus Arraut,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:10%
on what this means to us.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Jupiter is the planet of
news, of knowledge, of media.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:10%
And Neptune is the planet of
spirituality, of higher realms,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:10%
higher dimensions,
of the ethereal,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:10%
things that you cannot
explain, the mystical.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:10%
Something very interesting is
that Pisces, the constellation

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:10%
where both Jupiter
and Neptune unite,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:10%
is the realm of both
Jupiter and Neptune.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:10%
Because before Neptune
was discovered,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.900 align:middle line:10%
the Pisces constellation
was ruled by Jupiter.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that these
both celestial bodies

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:84%
unite in both of their
realms, in Pisces,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
it's a very redundant energy,
where this mystical Pisces

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
energy is going to be
blooming all of our lives.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This conjunction is in
April, but we may be feeling

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:90%
the effects now.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So the time this conjunction
peaks is in the middle

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
of April.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean we're only
going to feel it in April.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Because starting the
Piscean month, which

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.720 align:middle line:84%
starts the 18th
of February, we're

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
going to be having a
boom of Pisces energy.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
Because the sun is
going to be walking

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
towards this constellation,
throughout this constellation,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and highlighting the energy
of both Jupiter and Neptune

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:90%
in Pisces.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So starting the 18th of
February, closer to this date,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
we're already going to be
experiencing a big, big peak.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to be
till the end of April,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
when we see this energy
soothing a little bit more.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But something very
beautiful that the Piscean

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:90%
energy is bringing is healing.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It's understanding your wounds,
understanding what hurts

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
or what has hurt
you in the past,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and finding a guide, a
path towards healing,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
towards understanding, and
having a big compassion

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
for you, for your evolution,
for everyone around you,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:90%
for those who hurt you.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's filling your heart
with such a high vibration

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that you can experience
the love, second chances,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:90%
second opportunities.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like
coming back to life,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because you have a second chance
at love, and life, at work,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
because you reach another
state of consciousness.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most beautiful
way to put this energy.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.365 align:middle line:84%
So try to stay on the
positive side of Pisces.

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we stay on the
positive side of Pisces

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.835 align:middle line:84%
and experience
this healing power?

00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This conjunction wants
to make humanity aware that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:90%
there's a world under the sea.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There's the world of
consciousness under the sea.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And under the sea means
also in our inner waters,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:90%
our inner emotions.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a way of
humanity seeing how waters

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.470 align:middle line:90%
are so important in our lives.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And with that our
inner waters as well,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:90%
our inner emotions, our tears.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a very, very
sensitive few months, for sure.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So the way to handle this is
expressing, chanting, singing,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
the Pisces energy

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
in a much more conscious,
a lot more beautiful--

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:90%
its higher state.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Because Pisces is the energy of
the highest form of creativity,

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
the highest and most
beautiful state of love.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's going to be a lot
of love in the atmosphere

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
if you vibe with that aspect
or higher state of the Piscean

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> As the planets
move into conjunction,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Mercedes also recommends
journaling your dreams every

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
morning, getting
out into nature,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and tapping into your
Piscean creative energy.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
