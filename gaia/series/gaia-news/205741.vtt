00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Our brains are
overworked and overtired.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.670 align:middle line:10%
We spend all day working.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.800 align:middle line:10%
And with technology
at our fingertips,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:10%
we never give our brains a break
from directed intense focus.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:84%
This can lead to
attention fatigue.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.250 align:middle line:10%
And it may be damaging your
mental and physical health,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.380 align:middle line:10%
but there may be
an easy solution

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:10%
right outside your door.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:10%

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
our brains, there

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
are different
types of attention.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember the last time you
concentrated on a singular

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
task, like taking
a test or working

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:90%
on a complicated project?

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
After a certain amount of time
in that highly concentrated

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
state, people often
describe themselves as brain

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:90%
tired or even, brain dead.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Our minds are like muscles.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They can get overworked
when concentrating too long.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
That can lead to stress, weight
gain, burnout, and anxiety.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
The good news is our brains
can disconnect and recharge.

Dr. Ilene Naomi Rusk is a
neurobehavioral consultant

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
and co-director of
the Healthy Brain

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:10%
Program in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:10%
>> There are a number of ways
our brains get over-focused,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:10%
and tired, and fatigued.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:84%
We actually can focus
on screens for too long.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We can focus on
television for too long.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
With the advent of smartphones,
televisions, and these screens

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
we look at, we
don't have a break.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Our brains don't have a break.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Our attentional systems
don't really have a break.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly relevant
now because most of the world,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
at some point in the
last year and a half,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:90%
has been quarantined.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And that quarantine has actually
occurred due to a threat

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
response that we have
all felt. The attention,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:84%
at least in the last
year and a half,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
has particularly been focused
with fear in our surroundings.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different types
of attention depending on what

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
task we are trying
to accomplish.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Our brains know
which one to use.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We have directed
attention at one thing,

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
which is when you concentrate
for a long period of time

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:90%
on a task, like learning piano.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.370 align:middle line:84%
We have divided
attention when we're

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
looking at a couple of
things at the same time.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Executive attention, we're
focusing on something

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're saying this is
really a priority for me.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So each of those have
different brain regions

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible
for mediating

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:90%
that type of attention.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
The frontal regions are
involved and preparing us

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
for choosing what to look
at and how to respond.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>> But our ever-present
screens, smartphones,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and computers
overload our brains,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:90%
acting as false stimuli.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When brains focus on
one particular screen,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.310 align:middle line:84%
it can be very overwhelming
and fatiguing for our brain.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We're finding this in
the scientific literature

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
with children, with teens, and
certainly with adults, as well.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We all know, like, the
level of addictive quality

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:90%
that our smartphones have.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's not healthy.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
most important thing

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.775 align:middle line:84%
we lose when we do this
hyper-focusing is that we're

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
always looking to figure
something out that's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:90%
in a very narrow window.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We're very not
expansive with using

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
the rest of our neural network.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we disconnect
and recharge our brains?

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Experts say you can
switch your brain

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
from hyper-focused attention
to relaxed attention using

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:90%
attention restoration theory.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Which, put simply, is
to spend time in nature.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I observe that
when we're in nature,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
we still have attention, but
our attention is more diffuse,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
more calm.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
the literature is

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:84%
showing that our physiology
actually changes.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So it benefits
the immune system.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It benefits brain regions that
are stress-reducing systems

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
That if we have time in nature
and we have the opportunity

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
to do what the Japanese
call forest bathing--

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
they actually call
it shinrin-yoku--

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
when we have that
type of stimulation,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
we know that that's very healthy
for our bodies and our brains.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also a connection
to a major mental problem

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:90%
affecting children and adults.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I was really fascinated to
learn that this problem with

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
overactive sustained attention,
focused attention where

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
the brain actually gets really
exhausted can look a lot like

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Kids with ADHD, adults with
ADHD, adolescents with ADHD

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
do really, much better
in nature, as well.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it attention
restoration therapy or theory.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I call it the great
connection with nature.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
That's daily, if you can,
or as often as you can.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't yet know how or
why nature seems to rewire

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
our bodies and brains.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
But Dr. Rusk and
other researchers

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
recommend it as a way to
fix our attention fatigue.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Even sounds of nature can
be beneficial, as well

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.470 align:middle line:84%
as meditation, specifically
open awareness meditation.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do, remember
to unplug and go outside.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:10%
