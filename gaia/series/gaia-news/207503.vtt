00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
While there has been a
good deal of attention

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
paid to the
near-death experience,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
very little is known by the
general public about the shared

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:90%
death experience.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
A new research
survey is the first

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
of its kind to explore at length
this fascinating phenomenon.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:10%
William Peters is the founder
of the Shared Crossing Project,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:10%
which is dedicated
to educating people

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:10%
about the transformative
experiences of the dying.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:10%
He is also the author of
the just published book,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.390 align:middle line:10%
"At Heaven's Door."

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:10%
>> A shared death experience
occurs when somebody dies

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:10%
and a loved one,
caregiver, bystander,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:10%
expresses that they feel like
they shared in the transition

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.930 align:middle line:10%
of the dying from this human
life to what lies beyond

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:10%
and into the initial
stages of the afterlife.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:10%
There are a variety of ways
to be an SDE experiencer.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:90%
You can be at bedside.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
About 1/3 of our cases
are from experiencers

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
who are just at the bedside in
the room when someone is dying.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
2/3 are remote.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
That means they're not
even at the bedside

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
when someone's dying.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
life somewhere,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes they're
sleeping, and they kind of

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
find themselves drawn in to an
experience, the shared death

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
experience, in which
they are experiencing

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:90%
a variety of phenomena.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:10%
>> William has interviewed
hundreds of people about

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:10%
their experiences and
estimates that up to a 1/4

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:10%
of the world's population
may have had a shared death

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Shared Crossing's recent
survey of SDE accounts

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
brings forth the
range of phenomena

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:90%
common to the experience.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So the most common
phenomena would be this.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:10%
Alteration in the time
space continuum in the room.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, if
you're with them or even

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
if you're remotely,
you get a little dizzy.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You realize your world is
getting a little warped.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you might feel a pressure,
a pull upon your chest.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
If you are bedside, you might
see the spirit, soul spirit,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:90%
leaving the body.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
It can look like a
steam, or smoke, or mist

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%
coming off of a body.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice the light is
changing all around you.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
People, 51% of the time,
they report seeing the dying.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
They report seeing the
dying moving on a journey.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:10%
And there is often
communication between them,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:10%
but they are with this
loved one presumably,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:10%
because that what
is most of the time,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:10%
observing this, witnessing
this transition.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the more fascinating
accounts involve multiple

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
people experiencing an
SDE around the same death.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This experience I'm going
to share is from Amelia.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Her son, Tom, was
diagnosed with cancer

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:90%
at 10-years-old, terminal.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And when Tom finally died,
she was with him in his bed.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And she saw a beautiful,
beautiful lady of light appear.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And so she handed
her beloved son

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of 13-years-old to this woman,
spirit being, who was majestic,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:90%
and pulled Tom with her.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And let Amelia
know, I've got it.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
Right when this
experience was going on,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Amelia's sister, Charmaine,
walked into the room.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And Charmaine describes
seeing Tom rise out

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:36.020 align:middle line:84%
of his bed and head upwards
into another dimension.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And she thought-- and she
felt all this loving kindness

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So they had two different SDE's,
but around the death of Tom,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:90%
but very validating.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Can science explain these
remarkable experiences?

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.770 align:middle line:90%
William gives us his take.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There is some
energetic frequency.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:90%
We're all energetic.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think as somebody's
dying, their frequency

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is changing as they
drop their human body

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and begin to enter
into another dimension.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
In this frequency,
you can be drawn

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
into it and your frequency
as a person will change.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a pull from
this field to the experiencer.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> One particularly meaningful
aspect of the SDE is

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
the profound effect it
has on the experiencer.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> From our research, the after
effects are highly beneficial

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and profound.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
They have a sense that their
deceased loved one is alive

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and well in a
benevolent afterlife.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They have a sense
that they're going

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to see their deceased loved
one again at some future point.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
They have an alleviation in
their own anxiety and fear

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of death.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:10%
>> William has developed methods
for training people to have

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:10%
these experiences, which involve
connecting with a loved one

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:10%
whose death is imminent and then
entering into a state of love,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:10%
receptivity, and acceptance.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
To William, the implications
of researching and educating

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
people on the SDE
are far reaching.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Really what we're hoping is
that these experiences can be

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
embraced by our health care
systems by those of us who care

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
for people so that these
experiences can transform how

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:90%
it is that we die.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The SDE offers us an
invitation to see death

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
through this beautiful
lens of what's possible.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
A best death possible
for all of us

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
includes one with a
shared death experience,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and
for our loved ones.
