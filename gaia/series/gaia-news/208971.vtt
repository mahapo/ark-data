[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> A triple conjunction
is headed our way--

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Mars, Uranus, and the North Node
in the constellation of Taurus.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen this
conjunction in nearly 170 years.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Now big changes could be coming.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.350 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Between July 26
and August 1, we'll

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:84%
see a three-party astrological
conjunction between Mars,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Uranus, and the North Node in
the constellation of Taurus.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Mars and Uranus unite
every couple of years,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:90%
but the North Node does not.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this
conjunction in Taurus

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:90%
has not been seen since 1855.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So what does this
conjunction mean for you?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.167 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer Mercedes Arnus
Arraut breaks it all down.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:10%
>> To understand
this a little better,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:10%
let's put it into order.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:10%
So Mars, Mars is the
energy activator.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Mars is our drive.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Mars is an
accelerator of events.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it touches, it
accelerates and it turns it on.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:10%
Then Uranus is the
planet of awakening.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:10%
It's the planet
that wakes you up

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:10%
with whatever
experience is happening.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:10%
So Uranus is very unpredictable.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So it acts without even
having us any control over it

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:90%
because it's the rebel.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy of the
new, the innovation.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So we don't really know what can
happen with Uranus because it's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
going to give you
a new experience.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
The North Node is an
astrological point

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:90%
that is found by an axis.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And this axis is
found by the crossing

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of the orbit of the
moon around the Earth

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and the orbit of the
Earth around the sun.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
This axis is conformed by the
North Node and the South Node.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the North
Node is like a gateway.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:90%
It's like a door, pretty much.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So by Mars and Uranus arriving
to this astrological point

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that acts as a door
and in Vedic astrology

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is known as the head of the
dragon, hungry for knowledge

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and hungry for experiences,
what we can see

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
is that we're
attracting experiences

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
in our life that come in the
form of accelerated events

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that bring awakening
into our life.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:10%
>> How does the energy of Taurus
play into this conjunction?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Taurus is the energy of
life, the energy of animals,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
the energy of Earth, the energy
of finances, abundance, wealth.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's teaching us that
we can all be wealthy

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:84%
if we learn to stay present,
if we learn to stay grounded,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
if we learn to give
value to what we have

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:90%
in order to live in this life.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So if we value our
lives and if we

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're
valuing a planet,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
all situations
will just guide us

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
into experiencing a lot more
fun, a lot more pleasure,

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we learn
to enjoy ourselves.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And it can be very exciting.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And everything that's
going to be happening

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
is so that we
learn to give value

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
to our own life in this planet.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We may start feeling this
energy as early as July 5th.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
How should we prepare for this
potentially destabilizing push?

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It'd be good for us to know
that people are going to be

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
acting in a very
impulsive, very erratic,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:90%
very not themselves like.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So just bear it in mind so that
you don't take it personal.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happens, we're all
going through crazy shifts

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and energy activations.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And life is taking us to
change, to learn new things

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and do things that
we've never done before.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So it can be very scary.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And people can be
feeling very fearful.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Events like that, what
it does is bring people

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
closer together because there
are greater things happening

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:90%
outside.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a
sense of community

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in a sense of helping each
other out to make a better world

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:90%
and create a better planet.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we take advantage
of the energy at this time?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
>> This is like an event
accelerator also for everything

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.600 align:middle line:90%
happening in our planet.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So to take advantage of it,
I'd say it's a very good time

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to bring a new reality
into your life,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel like you're evolving,
feel like your business is

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
growing, feel like your
family is growing, expanding,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that you're learning
a lot about yourself

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and about your current
reality, and you're

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
expanding into a world that
you didn't know you were

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:90%
going to be expanding into.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sense of
healing in the world, so

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
medical advances
and new technology

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:84%
that is going to guide us into
really a new way of living

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:90%
a lot more consciously.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:10%
