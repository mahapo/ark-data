>> A powerful FDA-approved
anesthetic drug once used

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910 align:middle line:10%
mainly in operating rooms and
on the battlefield is quickly

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.850 align:middle line:10%
gaining ground as one of
the most promising therapies

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.940 align:middle line:10%
for treatment resistant
mental health conditions.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.470 align:middle line:90%

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:10%
First discovered as an
anesthetic in the 1950s,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:10%
ketamine has since been
used in the treatment

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
of a wide range of
physical conditions,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:10%
especially in pain management.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Starting in the
early 1970s, doctors

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
began to find that
it can also be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
very effective in
alleviating mental health

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
issues, such as depression,
anxiety, PTSD, and addiction.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Today, it is ever
more frequently

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
being studied and legally used
as an off-label medication

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to manage conditions
that are particularly

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
resistant to treatment with
conventional pharmaceuticals.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
The latest in a series
of recent studies

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
has found that ketamine can
quickly and dramatically

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
decrease chronic
suicidal thoughts.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Naveen Thomas
is a psychiatrist

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:10%
who has been using ketamine
in his practice for years.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I and many of my colleagues
have had, of course,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:10%
tremendous success in using
ketamine in people who are

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:10%
really suffering
from depression.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I've had a lot of success
in treating people

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
with post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of these folks
have spent years and years

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
doing absolutely
the best they could

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:84%
using such a wide variety of
the conventional treatments,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:84%
be they various medication
treatments, be they

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:90%
various forms of psychotherapy.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We've seen really
wonderful effects.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> While the mechanism by which
ketamine works isn't entirely

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:84%
clear, it is known that
it increases the amount

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of a neurotransmitter
called glutamine.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
This novel process likely
affects mood, thought patterns

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and cognition by producing
a non-ordinary state

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It is also thought that as
with other psychedelics,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
ketamine quiets the
brain's default mode

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
network, a dynamic
set of brain systems

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that are active when we are
not engaged in a specific task.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:10%
Researchers believe it
is where we construct

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:10%
the narrative of who
we are, and where

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.000 align:middle line:10%
we can get stuck in
destructive thought patterns.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Ketamine is thought to exert
its effect by opening up

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:90%
new pathways for thought.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>> In many mental
health conditions,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:10%
one of the challenges
that people struggle with,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:10%
is that self narrative can
often become rigid and fixed

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and often, quite
negative in nature.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Ketamine at the right
doses, can even temporarily

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
disrupt that pattern
that happens.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And someone can have an
experience of themselves

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as, let's say something
larger than that negative self

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
narrative.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
That ability to alter
someone's state of awareness

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is a really special
property of the medicine.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Ketamine can be administered
by a trained medical

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
professional in a number of
ways, including IV infusion,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
intramuscularly, and orally.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Patients can receive
treatment in a range

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of different settings, from
medical infusion clinics

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to more personalized
psychotherapy sessions.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:10%
Kevin Thorbain sought
out ketamine treatment

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:10%
after decades of unsuccessfully
battling mental health issues.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I dealt with depression and
anxiety most of my life in one

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:10%
form or another.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And the pharmaceuticals
that I was placed on,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the SSRIs, the Prozacs,
the Zolofts, et cetera,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
numbed my emotions
to the point where

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of felt like a
zombie, like I had no emotions.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And the side effects that I had
were the suicidal tendencies.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I would constantly think
about ending my life.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Kevin learned of
ketamine therapy,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and has for the last few
years, been receiving treatment

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
as part of a protocol
called ketamine-assisted

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapy, facilitated
by a group in Colorado called

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Medicinal Mindfulness.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
For Kevin and many
other patients,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the results of a limited
course of treatment

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
are profound and long-lasting.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Really, one of the primary
healing modalities of the work

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:10%
is offering people enough
of these, what I call,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.505 align:middle line:10%
expanded states, these
non-ordinary states

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, as the
primary healing modality.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Over time, they may not actually
need the ketamine treatment

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:90%
indefinitely.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, whatever
is out of balance

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
at some root level
came back into balance.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> First few months after that
first session were amazing.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
I was incredibly happy.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And as far as any anxious
suicidal thoughts,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:90%
they were gone.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It never even entered
my mind at all.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
My life, my personal life
seemed to get better and better

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:90%
the more sessions that I did.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
become more stable.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of quick
the first session,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
like I got a glimpse of
it, what it could do.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
But then the
subsequent sessions I

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
was able to go deeper and deeper
within myself to really heal

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:90%
myself so from within.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> While ketamine is
generally considered safe,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
as with all medications, it is
not appropriate for everyone.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
health conditions,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
such as cardiovascular
disease and history

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
of psychosis, which
would preclude someone

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.800 align:middle line:90%
from treatment.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Naveen Thomas also
stresses the importance

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
of working closely with a
trained medical professional

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
in the correct set
and setting, as is

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
done within the
ketamine-assisted psychotherapy

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%
protocol.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole point in some ways,
is to really create a really

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.265 align:middle line:84%
nurturing setting to get someone
into the most ideal mindset

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:32.105 align:middle line:84%
and with a therapist who really
knows what they're doing,

00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
is certified in this
work, and use this space,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
this expanded state, as a
tool for transformation.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Those who have experienced
the benefits of ketamine see it

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
as a blessing and have high
hopes that it will continue

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to be studied and become
more widely available.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> In general, it's really
gratifying for me to witness

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
people who are
experiencing what I call,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
the bigness of themselves,
experiencing themselves

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:84%
as a human being in the
fullest sense of the word.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:10%
>> For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."
