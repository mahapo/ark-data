00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Should artificial
intelligence be able

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.060 align:middle line:10%
to recreate you or
your dead relatives?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.330 align:middle line:84%
A major software company
just secured the patent

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.380 align:middle line:90%
to do just that.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like science fiction.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But it could be coming
to a screen near you.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Microsoft was recently
granted a patent

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
that outlines the
process of creating

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
a chatbot for a specific person.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever dealt with
online customer service,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
odds are you've
communicated with a chatbot.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:90%
But this would be different.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:10%
According to
Microsoft's patent, they

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:10%
would be able to access a
specific person's social media

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:10%
data to, quote,
"create or modify

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:10%
a special index in the theme
of the specific person's

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:10%
personality.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The special index may be
used to train a chatbot

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to converse in the personality
of a specific person."

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
The patent continues,
"In some aspects,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
a 2D or 3D model of
a specific person

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
may be generated using
images, depth information,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and/or video data associated
with the specific person."

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But this would reportedly allow
Microsoft or a future company

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
they sell the rights
to own and create

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
not just artificial
intelligence,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
but artificial people,
even after they are dead.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:10%
William Henry, author of
"The Singularity is Near,"

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:10%
on so-called resurrection bots.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:10%
>> It's very alarming to me.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's part of
a long-term trend

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:10%
that we find in the AI
business, if you will.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:10%
And that is to
dehumanize people,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:10%
to treat your
spiritual being, which,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:10%
the concept of resurrection
is a spiritual concept.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And Microsoft is
certainly not the only one

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
that talks about the possibility
of resurrecting loved ones,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
or creating chatbots,
or synthetic beings

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
that are modeled
after your loved ones.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And the real trouble
that I have with this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual or
metaphysical perspective,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is they treat you,
your eternal self,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
what spiritual people think
of as your soul, as simply

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
You are just the data.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Anything you've ever put
up online, that's you.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
they are redefining

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
the idea of what a soul is.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
A soul is not a God
given or God created

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:90%
eternal spiritual entity.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
To them, the soul
is just your data.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the
potential problems with this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:90%
technology?

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that there's some of
these deep fake videos that are

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again,
opening up the possibility

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of literally creating
artificial humans

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and relying more on artificial
humans than organic humans.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it really
rings some alarm bells,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
because once again, they're
saying that's the organic.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.570 align:middle line:84%
They're dehumanizing, they're
devaluing the organic flesh

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and blood aspects of
ourselves and saying,

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
look how much better
you look in AI.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Look how much better
your bot lives.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
live forever, which

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
is another aspect of this, and
most people don't think about,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we are all leaving
now digital footprints.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that digital
self that lives

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
online will be coagulated
into an online avatar that

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
will outlive anybody
who is alive today.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What can be done to restore
our humanity to such a fast

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:90%
developing technology?

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Science fiction has
always been like a guidepost

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:90%
for our civilization.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You have these futurists,
these thinkers,

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that can look into the future
and say, what if we did this?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're not saying
we should do this.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But they're trying to think
through the implications

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and ramifications of
what could be possible.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:90%
And we've crossed a line.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We've crossed the Rubicon
where now science fiction

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
is science fact.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And we we're not being told
the full ramifications of this.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I think
part of what we have to do

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:90%
is really slow this down.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:84%
We need some moral
and ethical oversight

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:90%
on what's happening with AI.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps the most obvious
question, why do this?

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they can, and
two, because there's a market

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of thing.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Kids that are growing up today
are used to that online world.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't have flesh and
blood contact, reduced

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.030 align:middle line:84%
physical contact,
and they're used

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to dealing with versions of
their loved ones on a screen

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and interacting through
a screen with no touch.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's kind of a
natural segue for them.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really think too
deeply about, wait a minute,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
there's legal, there's
moral, there's ethical,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
there's spiritual
aspects of this

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:90%
there are not being covered.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a major
corporation like Microsoft

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
owning you, in their terms,
this resurrection bot,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and owning all that data, that
raises some real alarm bells

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
for me, because
we're supposed to be

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:84%
sovereign and
individual beings here,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're not supposed to be
slaves to some corporation.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In the face of rapidly
developing technologies,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
could making our
humanity, ethics,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and morals be at the forefront
of some of these developments?

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
in the right hands

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
seems to do great things to
help us in our day to day lives,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:84%
but according to some
experts, left unchecked,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:90%
could wreak havoc on our future.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:10%
Steve Jobs once said,
"Technology is nothing.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:10%
What's important is that
you have faith in people."

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:10%
And in the end, humanity
will have the final say.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is "Gaia News."

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:90%
