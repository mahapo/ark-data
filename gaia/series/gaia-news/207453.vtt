rise in sleep issues,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.650 align:middle line:10%
it has never been more necessary
to address this epidemic.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.590 align:middle line:84%
An influx of new research
has been shedding light

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:84%
on the importance
of sleep and showing

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
the great promise of
natural approaches

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:10%
According to recent statistics,
at least one third of Americans

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:10%
don't get the recommended
seven hours of sleep per night.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:10%
And over the last few
years, sleep problems

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:10%
have been reported
in 40% of Americans.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Alarmed by these
numbers, researchers

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
have doubled their efforts at
studying the causes, effects,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:90%
and possible treatments.

Dr. Donese Worden is
a naturopathic doctor

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:10%
who has worked with multiple
patients with sleep issues

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:10%
and has lectured
extensively on the topic.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The importance of sleep
cannot be overstated.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:10%
It detoxes our body, not only
the brain in its detoxification

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:10%
process but the entire body.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
regenerate our body.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:90%
That's called ATP.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The cells also need to
rest at a certain point

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to re-energize themselves
to do all of the processes

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
that they do in the body.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to tell our body
we need to burn more fat.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
It allows our body to say, it
is time to regulate blood sugar,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
help the cardiovascular
system repair.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If we're not
sleeping well, we're

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
more at risk for atherosclerosis
and other metabolic diseases.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One significant area of
recent research has been around

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:90%
the causes of sleep problems.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Multiple factors have
been implicated, including

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
stress responses, nutritional
deficits and excesses,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and nighttime routines.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Your nighttime routine
is called sleep hygiene.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.289 align:middle line:90%
Is the room dark?

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Blackout curtains
are important here.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Is the room cold enough?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%
That affects your sleep.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So looking at the basics
of cold room, dark room,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and blue light.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Is the computer on?

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Are you looking at
your cell phone?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Blue light has been linked,
with a very recent study,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
into affecting our quality
of our sleep and ability

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.390 align:middle line:90%
to go to sleep.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies suggest that blue
light decreases the production

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of melatonin, which is necessary
for the induction of sleep.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Another focus of recent
study is the connection

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
between nutrition,
inflammation, and sleep.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Long-term nutritional
deficiencies alter inflammation

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
inflammation or certain types

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of inflammatory cells,
such as cytokines,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:90%
that affects our sleep cycles.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Those are new studies showing
us that the more inflammation

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:84%
we have, the more sleep
disturbances we may have.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Asking your physician to run a
cardio reactive protein marker

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
would be a great way to look
at your overall inflammation.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Recent research has
also been clearly showing

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:10%
the far-reaching consequences
of inadequate and poor-quality

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.640 align:middle line:10%
sleep.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The more studies
that we conduct,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
the more interplay we see
between sleep and many common

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
disorders in the body, from
obesity to cardiovascular

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:90%
disease to diabetes.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Research has shown us that when
our sleep patterns are not good

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that we are more likely
to have cognitive decline

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:90%
during the day.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Our memory is not as good.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And our executive
function is not there.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And a large new
study just showed us

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:10%
that if we are in the
50s and 60-year-olds,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:10%
if they're not
getting enough sleep,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:10%
they're more prone to have
dementia in their senior years.

>> In the search for
solutions to sleep issues,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
numerous recent studies
have borne out the efficacy

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
of various natural approaches.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In the "International
Journal of Clinical Practice,"

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.370 align:middle line:84%
a recent study was looking for
non-pharmacological treatments

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:90%
for insomnia.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was that
it's more prevalent in females.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And as females age, it
becomes more prevalent.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But the conclusion
showed that things

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that really help the best were
cognitive behavioral therapy--

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that's types of counseling--
exercise, relaxation,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and approaches like
light therapy--

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
the right kind of
light, not blue light--

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
but aromatherapy, music therapy,
and some herbal medicines

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
were shown to be helpful.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One interesting new study
provides another possible

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
solution for those
suffering from insomnia.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> A new study from the "British
Journal of Sports Medicine"

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
showed that getting enough
physical activity during

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
the day may counter the negative
effects that happen from

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy sleep patterns.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> While the prevalence of
sleep issues is clearly a grave

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
concern, the increasingly deeper
understanding of their causes

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and mounting evidence of the
success of natural treatments

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
should give hope to all those
desperately in need of a good
