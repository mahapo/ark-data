>> One of the greatest
mysteries of our universe--

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.900 align:middle line:10%
what existed before
the Big Bang,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.780 align:middle line:10%
and how was our
universe created?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Was our universe
created in a lab,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
by a higher form of
extraterrestrial intelligence?

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have
studied for years

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the many different
possibilities that

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:84%
may have created the Big Bang,
how our universe was created.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, Avi Loeb, Harvard
Professor of Science and author

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.690 align:middle line:10%
of "Extraterrestrial, The First
Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:10%
Earth" proposes in
his latest editorial

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:10%
for "Scientific American"
that our universe

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:10%
may have been created in a lab.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Modern physics has a problem.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We do not yet have
a good understanding

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
of how to unify quantum
mechanics and gravity.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
If we did, we could,
in theory, figure out

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:90%
how to create a Big Bang.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.805 align:middle line:84%
This idea led Professor
Loeb to his theory.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We imagine a civilization
that had science and technology

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
for much more than a
century, the way we did.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, they could have arrived
at the theory that unifies

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:90%
quantum mechanics and gravity.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they figure out how
the Big Bang can be created,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they could also
produce it themselves

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And if that happens,
then there is

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting possibility
just like in nature.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You have multiple generations
where, for example, a chick

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
comes out of an egg,
becomes a chicken,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and lays another
egg, and so forth.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:90%
That can continue forever.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a universe
like ours giving birth

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to an intelligent
civilization that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.866 align:middle line:84%
can create a universe
like the one that made it.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine if different
civilizations were given

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:90%
a letter grade.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Professor Loeb puts
us at a grade C.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The more advanced civilizations
have higher grade.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One can, in principle,
classify civilizations

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in the universe into
different classes.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Type C civilization
is similar to ours,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:84%
where we rely on the
sun to keep us alive.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And we are using
our environment,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.360 align:middle line:90%
the way it was provided to us.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But then, one can imagine
a civilization type

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
B, which is not dependent on the
star next to which it was born.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it can create a habitat
that supports its life far away

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
from the star.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
creating a platform where

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
a civilization can live happily
using nuclear energy that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
is supplied to it from nuclear
reactors, and not from the star

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that it happens to
be born next to.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:90%
That will be type B.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, type A
civilizations would

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
be those that are
capable of recreating

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
the astrophysical
environment that they

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
live in-- and in particular,
the universe as a whole.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So creating a universe
in the laboratory

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.950 align:middle line:84%
implies that you are at the top
of the class of civilizations

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't reached
that yet because we don't

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:90%
have quantum theory of gravity.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If we are a C class
civilization now,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
has there been any time in
history when we may have

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.150 align:middle line:84%
received a nudge forward, a
push from a more intelligent

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
or sophisticated
extraterrestrial civilization

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
in the past?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> About 70 years ago, the
famous physicist Enrico Fermi

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
sat with his group at
Los Alamos for lunch.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And they discussed
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And he asked, if they exist
out there, where is everybody?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a very
presumptuous question

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:84%
because we had
recorded history only

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:84%
for 10,000 years, which
is about one millionth

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:90%
of the age of Earth.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And his question is similar
to sitting at home and asking,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:90%
nobody is knocking on my door.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I don't
have neighbors.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:90%
Do I have neighbors?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And the reality of the
situation is that they

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
could have visited long ago.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
They could have witnessed
Earth and perhaps even

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
interfered with what
happened on Earth.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
But we would never know
because only microbes or maybe

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
even dinosaurs were around.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't
visited in a way

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
that we would recognize
very recently.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, one way to
figure out if we are alone

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:90%
or not is to search.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.745 align:middle line:84%
Without searching, we would
never find the answer.

00:05:16.745 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an interesting
thought piece,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
but what's the takeaway?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.060 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with
this information?

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The important lesson from
this possibility is that we

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
should search for class A
or class B civilizations

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
because we might not be the
smartest kid on the block.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can learn from those
civilizations regarding

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
how to behave and how
to get our act together.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Because at the moment,
not only are we

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:84%
relying on the sun
for our energy supply,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
but we are also destroying
our environment in a way

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that it will not allow
us to, in principle,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:84%
survive for more than a few
centuries into the future.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And so, my hope is that
by finding evidence

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
for more advanced
civilizations, we

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
will be convinced to behave
in a more clever way.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:10%
