>> Our brains don't slow
down until much older than

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.520 align:middle line:10%
previously thought.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And how to train your
brain to stay focused,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:10%
no matter what is
going on around you.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
The past few
decades, studies have

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:10%
shown the speed at which
the human brain can

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.980 align:middle line:10%
make simple decisions
peaks in our 20s,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
with a rapid decline in
mental speed as we get older.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
But a new study out of
Heidelberg University

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:10%
in Germany, shows that our
brain speed doesn't slow down

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:10%
until our 60s.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:10%
This new study included more
than one million participants.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And as author of the study,
Dr. Mischa von Krause,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of Heidelberg University
wrote, our results

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
show that average levels
in mental speed and context

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
demanding fast and
forced decisions

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
do not decline until relatively
late in the lifespan.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It is true the average time
to give a correct answer

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:90%
peaks at about 20 years old.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
But the authors
of this new study

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
say the brains of older
people are still fast.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It's their life experience that
makes them more cautious when

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:90%
responding to a question.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Put another way, a
20-year-old will confidently

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:90%
sacrifice accuracy for speed.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But as the participants
grew older,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
they made fewer mistakes
until they hit the age 60.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Von Krause added,
it looks as, though,

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:10%
in the course of
our life, we don't

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:10%
need to fear any substantial
losses of mental speed,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:10%
particularly not in the course
of a typical working life.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:10%


00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Meantime, no matter what your
age, in this modern time,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:10%
you are facing a constant
barrage of distractions, so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:10%
much so that neuroscientist
Amishi Jha argues

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:10%
we miss about half of our
lives due to distractions.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:10%
In her recent book, "Peak
Mind, Find Your Focus,"

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:10%
she says you can
retrain your brain.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Jha argues, first,
stop multitasking.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Jha told "Inc Magazine" think
of your focus like a flashlight.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It can't shine two
places at the same time.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
Instead, engage in monotasking.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Second, take brain breaks
throughout the day,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:90%
using the stop method.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:90%
S, stop what you're doing.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
T, take a breath.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630 align:middle line:84%
O, observe what is
happening around you.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:90%
And P, proceed.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And finally,
practice mindfulness.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Take 12 minutes per day
to focus on your breath.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Notice when your
mind has wandered.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Redirect your attention back
to your breath and repeat.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The goal is not to
have no distractions.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
That's impossible, but to
notice when you are distracted

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and get back on track.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Through this easy
practice, Jha says

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you can retrain your brain
to focus and get back

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.135 align:middle line:84%
the half of your life
that is slipping away.

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
