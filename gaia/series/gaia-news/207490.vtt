>> In the field of research
being done on intention

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.440 align:middle line:10%
and manifesting, Lynne
McTaggart is legendary.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Her latest intention
experiment sought

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.970 align:middle line:84%
to bring peace to
a polarized America

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:84%
right before the
presidential inauguration.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Those results and more on "The
Power of Group Intention."

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Lynne McTaggart is a journalist
and best-selling author

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:10%
world-renowned for
her groundbreaking

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.170 align:middle line:10%
work on consciousness and
the power of intention.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
She is also the architect
of The Intention Experiment,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
a global laboratory
involving thousands

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of participants testing
the power of group thoughts

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:90%
to heal the world.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Her research has repeatedly
shown the profound effect

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%
thoughts have on reality.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We're all a batch of
vibrating packets of energy.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:10%
So there's nothing solid
or stable about us.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing solid or
stable about the world.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:10%
And in between
different objects is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:10%
a giant quantum energy field.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:10%
We're all in the field,
and our subatomic particles

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:10%
make up the field.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So, because we
are energy, energy

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:84%
is changing at every moment
at the subatomic level.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is an
actual anything yet.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It's every possible
state all at once.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
found is what turns

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that potential of something into
something real is an observer.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So our consciousness,
our ability to observe,

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
our ability to intend,
also makes us a creator.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Lynne's intention
experiments,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:84%
running since 2007, are
some of the first controlled

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
explorations of the
power of mass intention.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
In these experiments,
she invites an audience

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to send a specific
thought to affect

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.770 align:middle line:84%
a target, after which
a team of scientists

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:84%
calculate the results to
measure possible change.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I've run 40
intention experiments,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
everything from trying to make
plants grow faster and seeds

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
grow faster, to purifying
water, to lowering violence

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in war-torn areas
or violent areas,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.330 align:middle line:90%
to even healing someone of PTSD.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And of those 40, 35 have shown
measurable, positive, mostly

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
significant effects
as measured by teams

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of scientists in different
prestigious universities.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:10%
So we've got lots of evidence
that thoughts are things

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:10%
that affect other things.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Of particular significance to
Lynne is her peace experiments,

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:10%
which include the two she has
now done on the 10th and 20th

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:10%
anniversaries of 9/11.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What I have observed
since 2011 was,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
when I bring warring tribes
together to do an intention

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
together, they start
forgiving each other.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I first did that
with Arabs and Americans

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:84%
with the 10th
anniversary of 9/11.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And we sent intention to
two southern provinces

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
in Afghanistan, which were
the most violent areas

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
of Afghanistan.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:10%
Now, studies from
NATO afterward showed

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:10%
very intriguing
evidence, which showed

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:10%
a huge lowering of violence
in just those two provinces.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:10%
But in my mind, the most
important and interesting part

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:10%
of the study was that the
Arabs and the Americans

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.900 align:middle line:10%
started writing to each other
on my instant messenger pages.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:84%
They started
befriending each other,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and they started
forgiving each other.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Her most recent intention
experiment was done around

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:10%
the time of the 2021
presidential inauguration

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:10%
to try to bring together
polarized Americans.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Right before
the inauguration,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:10%
after we had that
storming of the Capitol,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:10%
I invited Republicans,
Democrats,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:10%
members of the police, African
Americans, a former jihadist--

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:10%
we had people of all political
persuasions coming together,

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.140 align:middle line:10%
doing an intention for
peace at the Capitol

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:10%
for the inauguration.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was an
extraordinary lovefest.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:10%
>> While it's difficult to
prove that the lack of violence

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:10%
at the inauguration was
tied to this experiment,

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:10%
what is clear is the profound
effect it had on each

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:10%
of the participants.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
A majority have reported
extraordinary improvements

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:90%
in their health and well-being.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyone involved expressed
feeling less divided.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The effects of all
these peace experiments

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
have been significant, both on
a mass and individual scale.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> From 2008, I started
surveying the audience to say,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:90%
well, how was that for you?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was astounded
to see that people

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:84%
were having extraordinary
changes in their lives.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They made up with
estranged partners.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They were more connected
to their not-so-nice boss.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
They were hugging
strangers, essentially.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Just about half
every single time

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
say they are more
loving with everyone

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
they come into contact with.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So that involvement
in a peace experiment

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
reflected back on
them, and their lives

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%
became more peaceful.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it that accounts for
these transformational effects?

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that there's
several pieces here.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I think a giant piece
is intention, of course,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:90%
our ability to be creators.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
A second big piece
here is altruism.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are so
involved in self-help

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in the personal
development world,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think
much about other help.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But other help isn't
just a nice thing to do.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
All the studies show that when
you do things for other people,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
no matter how small, you
live a longer, healthier,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:90%
happier life.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Group effect-- I mean,
I've been fascinated

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to see groups create
remarkable change.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Can these effects be seen
when done in smaller groups?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Lynne first tested
this idea in 2008,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:84%
when she first began her
Power of Eight groups,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
in which people in small
groups send and receive

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
healing intentions.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Since then, she has seen some
truly astounding results.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We experimented, and I've
experimented and now put

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:90%
thousands of people in groups.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
We've had extraordinary
healings, everything

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
from people getting up
out of their wheelchair,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
to reversing stage 4 cancer,
to healing life-threatening

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:90%
sepsis.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I think it's this
powerful element of being

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:90%
able to give and receive

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> More on the extraordinary
power of intention in these

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.660 align:middle line:84%
small groups in part 2 of our
special investigation of "The

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Power of Group Intention."
