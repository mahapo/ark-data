00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.290 align:middle line:10%
>> What can the final words
spoken by the dying tell us

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.420 align:middle line:10%
about life's greatest mystery?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.990 align:middle line:84%
According to the findings of
a long-term research project,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.910 align:middle line:90%
a great deal.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:10%
Lisa Smartt is a linguist
who, in 2012, became

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
interested in the words
spoken by the dying

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:10%
when she noticed peculiar
changes in her father's speech

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.612 align:middle line:10%
as he was passing.

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the things I
noticed while I was sitting

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.977 align:middle line:10%
bedside with my father--

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:10%
well, the first thing
was he started talking

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:10%
about angels in the room.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:10%
And my dad was a
hardcore scientist.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:10%
So when I heard my tough,
gruff, cigar-smoking papa

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:10%
talking about angels in
the room, I took notice.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And being a linguist, I pulled
out my pencil and my pad

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:90%
and started taking notes.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
Three days before he died,
he shared that the angels

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%
say only three days left.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, three days
later, he was gone.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And what began to
emerge in my notes

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
intrigued me and led me to
the language of the dying.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.610 align:middle line:90%
And there wasn't much written.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:10%
So I attended a workshop
with Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:10%
And together, we established
the Final Words Project.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the project began,
Lisa has collected 200 accounts

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
of the last words of the dying
from those at their bedsides.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Throughout more than
a decade of analysis

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
of 2,000 final
utterances, Lisa has

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
come to see many universal
patterns and recurring themes.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Specifically, you see
patterns about a big event

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
coming.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Someone might say, oh,
the big dance is coming,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:90%
or the big art show is coming.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And then people also
talk about traveling,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
some kind of the ship is
ready, the boat is ready,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.330 align:middle line:84%
feeling that something
is moving them along

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
that's almost bigger
than they are.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And then another way that
this hybrid language appears

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:84%
is someone may say,
get me my checkbook,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I need to pay at the
gate, as if they're

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:90%
referring to Heaven's gate.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're bringing
pieces of this world

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to
talk with the other.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
People might start
talking about things

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
that some family members
or loved ones might think

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
are nonsense, like,
my husband, who

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
had died 10 years ago,
standing at the edge of my bed.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, to some people, they
may think that's nonsense.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:10%
But it seems from our
research and others

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:10%
that there actually are
visitors standing at the bedside

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:10%
with those who are dying,
and that's not nonsense.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One particularly fascinating
implication is the glimpse

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
these final words seem to
provide of what may come after

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:90%
physical death.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of repetition.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
One well-known example of this
is Steve Jobs's "wow, wow, wow"

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
before he died.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I think those were actually
his very final words.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can only
imagine what did

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
he see, what did that
exclamation refer to.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And people definitely start
talking about how beautiful it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:90%
is over there.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I've come in contact with
so many people who have

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:90%
had near-death experiences.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
There's just sense of--
such a sense of peace

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that the first word that
comes to mind is peace.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
this in some people

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
even before they die-- that
there is this energy that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
seems to be moving towards
some kind of new emergence

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:90%
or a new state of being.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what do these final
words suggest about the nature

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And just metaphor, talking
about angels in the room

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and visions and predeceased
relatives in the walls looking

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.855 align:middle line:84%
like trees or seeing lights
and all kinds of things are

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a complete indication to me
that there's something going

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
on as people are dying that
is some reflection that

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
consciousness continues.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And that process
of the transition--

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we return to
source, to that light and love.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people describe
from near-death experiences

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:10%
as that ball of consciousness--
as light and love.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Lisa points out that despite
the many transcendent words

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
spoken by the dying, the process
itself is not always easy

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and offers this advice for
those at their bedsides.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I suggest that people
have a journal or log next

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to the person's bed or, if you
feel comfortable and they do

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:84%
feel comfortable, just put it
on your phone and record things.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Seeing them, begin to
see if you see any themes

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
or language or even
references to visitors

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes,
because of our own grief,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and also because some things
sometimes sound nonsensical out

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
of context, we don't
really-- we're not really

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.820 align:middle line:84%
tracking the
patterns of language

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
or what people-- or the
themes that people are saying.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:10%
See if it's possible to
hold the whole experience

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:10%
as a sacred experience, even
as difficult and challenging--

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:10%
just hold it as sacred and
assume that what you're seeing

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:10%
and what you're hearing are
actually sacred messages.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> For Lisa, this Final Words
Project has been a truly

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
profound personal journey and
a great help in guiding her own

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
mother through
the dying process.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> When I speak to my mother and
say, when she's going fearful,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I can say, God's holding you, or
whatever you want to call that

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:90%
larger divine--

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:90%
the light.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
The light is holding you.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful that I was
exposed to all this material

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
to know so deeply some other
dimensional experience happens.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know quite
what it is, but it is.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:10%
