Here's what we know.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.750 align:middle line:84%
November 18, a
metallic monolith was

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:84%
discovered in a remote
part of the Utah desert.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It was only found
because members

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:84%
of the Utah Department
of Public Safety

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
were conducting an
aerial count of bighorn

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:90%

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

>> Was it an art installation?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:90%
An old movie set?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:90%

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Internet sleuths using Google
Maps were able to figure out it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%
appeared as early as 2016.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Then, 10 days after it was
discovered, it disappeared.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Soon it was revealed
local outdoorsmen

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:84%
removed the monolith
as visitors were

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
causing environmental damage.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Meantime in Romania,
another monolith

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
similar in
construction was found

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:10%
near an archaeological
site overlooking

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:10%
the city of Piatra Neamt.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And almost as soon as it was
discovered, it disappeared.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:90%
What does it all mean?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins, science
and history writer

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:10%
and author of "Gobekli
Tepe: Genesis Of The Gods"

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:10%
had some theories.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What amazes me is that there
have been literally millions

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
of posts, comments,
news stories, et cetera,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:90%
et cetera on this.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to say it's gone
viral is an understatement.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at it
more in terms of the impact.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know why these
monuments were put up yet.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:90%
We honestly don't.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some guys could
come out of the woodwork

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and say it's part of some
kind of advertising campaign,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.800 align:middle line:84%
or they just did it as
a joke, or whatever.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
But the symbolism is very clear.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:10%
It's mimicking the
monoliths that appeared

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:10%
in "2001, A Space Odyssey".

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Here, the monoliths represented
the first alien contact

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
with humanity.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%
This is very subtle.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.310 align:middle line:84%
This is through
human consciousness.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it being done
on a psychic level?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is something that
is coming up again and again

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:90%
in all of these news stories.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, I think
that there is also

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
a similarity between
the monoliths

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and the concept of crop circles.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
believe the crop

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
circles are from some kind
of otherworldly source.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:10%
But in my experience of having
lived in the very area where

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:10%
many of these crop
circles were appearing,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:10%
in the area of
Wiltshire in England,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:10%
there are a number
of groups that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:10%
go around making
these crop formations.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And I knew them all.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Some I got on with,
some I didn't.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.413 align:middle line:84%
But all of them were
united in one thing,

00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
fact that they felt

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that they were in some way
inspired to do what they did.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Crop circle makers
compare themselves

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
with the surrealist painters
of the 1940s, the 1950s, who

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
believed that they
could stand or sit

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in front of a blank
canvas and just

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
allow the spirits to channel
through exactly what it

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
was that they created
on that canvas.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, who's to say that
they weren't being inspired

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
by some otherworldly source?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we see the monoliths in
some way connected with this,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
it is very possible that the
creators of the monoliths

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
placed them where they did
for a very good reason,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
inspired to do it.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They might deny
it, but of course

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
some of the crop circle makers
did exactly the same thing.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think that there's
a pattern building here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This is part of a
much bigger picture.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:10%
>> If the people behind it
were inspired by something

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:10%
otherworldly, what is
the bigger purpose?

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps the winter solstice,
where we have this incredible

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.320 align:middle line:10%
planetary alignment where
Jupiter and Saturn will be

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:10%
so close that they will
virtually appear like one

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:10%
beautiful, brilliant
star in the sky.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Many astrologers,
many new agers are

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
looking towards this as some
kind of second 2012 event.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, many
indigenous cultures

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
are also set to do
rituals at this time,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:84%
including the
aboriginals of Australia

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:84%
who will be carrying out a
ceremony on Uluru, Ayers rock,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:90%
in Australia.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya of Mexico
and the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.585 align:middle line:84%
They also will be doing
rituals at this time.

00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like this
is a booster date.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> How could these monoliths
be linked to that event?

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.775 align:middle line:84%
>> It's part of almost like a
zeitgeist that's building up

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:13.575 align:middle line:90%
towards something.

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:10%
Many other people around
me can feel it as well.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:10%
And I suspect we are
going to find probably

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:10%
more of these monoliths.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are going
to look exactly the same.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are going to
appear just overnight in places.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:10%
Some will be related
to the original artists

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:10%
and some will be inspired to
be created by new artists that

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:10%
just want to get into the act.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
You could call them
copycat, but I think

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:90%
that something's building here.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, this
has a very similar feel

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to when the crop circles
started appearing

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:90%
in Britain in the early 1990s.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It has exactly
that same momentum.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As more monoliths and
anomalies begin to appear

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
around the world, remember,
this could be part of a bigger

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:84%
message channelled from
another unknown dimension.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:10%
