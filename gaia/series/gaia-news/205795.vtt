00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690 align:middle line:10%
>> A stellar surprise
hidden in space.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.840 align:middle line:10%
More than 100 black holes
hiding in our own galaxy.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
What could we learn
from this new find?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
consciousness connection

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:90%
to this mystery of the galaxy?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.593 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Scientists were stunned to
find more than 100 black holes

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
in the Milky Way, about three
times the number of black holes

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:90%
thought to be in the area.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
NASA describes a black hole as
a place in space where gravity

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
pulls so much that even
light cannot get out.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The gravity is so strong
because matter has been

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:90%
squeezed into a tiny space.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
These black holes are hidden
within a cluster of stars

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:84%
called Palomar 5, about
80,000 light years from Earth.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:10%
Astronomer and Gaia
News contributor

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Marc Dantonio on the
significance of this discovery.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:10%
>> They didn't expect that there
would be so many young stars

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:10%
that had blown up and become
supernovae and then left these

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:10%
black holes behind.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But there are, and so it
means that at one point,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
this was a very, very rich
star cluster at some point.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Very, very bright, probably
visible, most likely

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:90%
visible from galaxies away.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, we see these types of
things from other galaxies.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So this was a really
unique opportunity,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and it presents a
unique opportunity

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
to study these black holes
because they're actually

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:90%
kind of near each other.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not in a cluster,
they're kind of in a stream,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:90%
like I said.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
As the ongoing star formation
and star death occurred,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
it occurred all along this
location in the galaxy

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and then this went boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and popped off, each one
leaving behind a black hole.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's really a good
opportunity to study this.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just the
amount of black holes,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
but what we can learn from them.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Lead author of the study Mark
Gieles said in a statement,

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
these streams formed,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
we need to study one with
a stellar system associated

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Palomar 5 is the
only case, making

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
it a Rosetta Stone for
understanding stream formation.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we
studied it in detail.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
With this new information,
this Rosetta Stone,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility of learning
more about this phenomenon,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
could we theoretically
prove that black holes

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:84%
serve as portals or wormholes
to another time or place?

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:10%
Founder of the Resident Science
Foundation Nassim Haramein.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:10%
>> We have found black holes,
and we know that things fall

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:10%
into black holes, and we don't
know if they reemerge somewhere

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:10%
else in the parallel universe,
or in another galaxy,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:10%
or we don't know.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So black holes themselves
could be thought as evidence

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
of portals and wormholes.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.465 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we could
think of it that way.

00:02:57.465 --> 00:03:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And to some, no matter
what religion or upbringing,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual
aspect to black holes.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:10%
As Jesuit religious
brother, physicist,

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:10%
and director of the Vatican
Observatory, Guy Consolmagno,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:10%
wrote in a recent article, "Can
you find God in a black hole?",

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:10%
where he states, quote, "A
black hole is a perfect example

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:10%
of something we've believed in
even though we cannot see it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:10%
or touch it."

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Meantime, columnist Vikram
Zutshi posed the question,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
are black holes where the
mystic and the modern meet?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
There are many
striking parallels

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
between Eastern thought
and modern astrophysics,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
especially in their
imagining of space, time,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:90%
and the birth of the universe.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
The universe can surprise
and inspire us every day.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:10%
For as Carl Sagan said, quote,
the cosmos is within us.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:10%
Some part of our being knows
this is where we came from.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:10%
We long to return.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:10%
And we can, because
we're made of star stuff.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:10%
We are a way for the
universe to know itself.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.425 align:middle line:10%
