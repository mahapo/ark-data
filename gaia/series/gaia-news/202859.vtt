00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Grail, the
legendary Cup of Christ

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
said to have been used by
Jesus at the Last Supper.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Treasure hunters have
searched for it for centuries.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.410 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of people have
claimed to possess it.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:10%
And now UK-based amateur
archaeologist Barrie-Jon Bower

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:10%
tells "The Sun" newspaper
he knows where it is.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Bower, who says he has studied
the Grail and the Knights

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Templar for years,
believes the Grail

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is hidden in a secret chamber
beneath a man-made river

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
in the Hounslow
Heath area of London.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
But how could one of the most
sought after relics of the Holy

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Land make its way to
an underground hiding

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:90%
place in London?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Bower tells "The Sun" the
Knights Templar trained

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
in this area before
their crusades and claims

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
they built the secret
underground crypt

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to hide treasures
from the Holy Land.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:10%
Bower told "The Sun,"
quote, "Finally I am

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%
certain this is the right spot.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:10%
I am certain there
will be a vault

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:10%
beneath the surface
with the Grail inside

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:10%
and other treasures
from the Crusades."

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:10%
Freddy Silva, independent
researcher and author

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:10%
of the "First Templar Nation,"
has studied the Templars

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:10%
and the Holy Grail for years.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:10%
So what will they find?

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the problem is that the
Grail is not a physical object.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:10%
It's a metaphorical object.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
That's the problem.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:10%
They'll never find
a physical object.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The Cup is the
metaphoric cup that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
holds the wisdom of initiation.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Templars
were protecting all along.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And paradoxically, it
also represents a person.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.575 align:middle line:90%
It represents a bloodline.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's essentially
what it was all about.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So the thing with
understanding the mysteries

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to
understand that they talked

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.040 align:middle line:90%
in riddles and metaphors.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And unless you
understand the metaphor,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll always be looking
for a physical object.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So good luck with the
dredging operation.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Holy Grail has
always been a metaphor,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
why has there been this
fascination with hunting

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
for a physical
relic for centuries?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I think it's to do with
the lack of understanding.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Once an idea has reached its
climax and then it disappears--

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Templars were
handed out of existence.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:90%
They were underground.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And they took their
secrets with them.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
People tried to
infiltrate the Order.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of succeeded
but not very well,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
because there was
a sort of a shoot

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to kill order if anybody
managed to penetrate

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the inner temple of
brotherhood because they

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
had some very special secrets
that they were holding on to.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
one of their rules--

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:84%
if any brother or
sister should give away

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.423 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of the inner
temple, in serious cases

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
they would be shot, even
if it's the King of France.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Grail is
not a physical relic,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:90%
how did we get here?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the thing with
the Templars is if you go

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to the place where they had
their most famous monuments

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
in Portugal, the tower, or
the Rotunda as they call it,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
in Tomar is the
repository of the Grail.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
nothing physical there.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look
at the name of the town

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
where this was built.
It's called Tomar, which

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:90%
in Portuguese means to drink.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't
drink a building.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:90%
So therefore, there's your clue.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You're drinking a
metaphorical cup.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
You're drinking the
knowledge, the wisdom that's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
buried and hardwired
into the building,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
because that's where the
teachings were taught.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the Templar
story, they were following

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're practicing
something called the Way, which

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
series of teachings

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes and Jesus
Christ were following.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:10%
That gives you a very
big clue, because I

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:10%
traced the concept
of the Way back

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:10%
all the way through the
Middle East through Sumeria.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:10%
And there's a paper trail that
goes all the way back to Japan

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:10%
at about 8,000 BC, where you had
the 17 teachings of the goddess

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:10%
Ise.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And the people were called
the Followers of the Way.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And that became known as
the Tai, which we know today

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%
as the Tao, or the Dao.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:10%
So these are spiritual teachings
which go back to a time

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:10%
when gods rule the Earth
before the end of the Ice Age.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
It's part of this concept
of the divine bloodline.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's also
something that crept all

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.910 align:middle line:84%
around the world and something
that the Templars were also

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:90%
protecting.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So now we go back to the story
of Jesus, Mary Magdalene.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Why was the Church so adamant on
promoting Jesus and denouncing

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene and worse,
making us forget about John

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.908 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, who's actually
the most important story?

00:04:36.908 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person that the
Templars were protecting

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
and they honored
beyond anyone else

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was John the Baptist
and Mary Magdalene.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And Freddy Silva's advice
for Bower and anyone looking

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
for the Cup of Christ as a
physical relic you can hold

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:90%
in your hand?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Give up.

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] The trick is-- the
thing is with archaeology--

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I respect these people
as much as the grief

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I get from them because they're
looking for physical objects.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They have to
understand the language

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:90%
of metaphor and the mystery.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking
for the Cup of Christ,

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
you'll never find it.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just not there.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphor.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a symbol.

one thing is for sure--
