>> In this "Gaia News"
special investigation,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.630 align:middle line:10%
we take a look at groundbreaking
new research being done

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.500 align:middle line:10%
on ayahuasca, an ancient
psychedelic plant medicine that

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500 align:middle line:10%
is showing great promise in
addressing the most difficult

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000 align:middle line:10%
to treat mental health
conditions and may even change

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:10%
our DNA.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Simon Ruffell is a
psychiatrist and researcher

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.160 align:middle line:10%
who led this study, conducted
in the Peruvian Amazon.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Ayahuasca is a psychedelic
brew that's used in the Amazon

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:10%
rainforest.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:10%
It's been used for at
least hundreds of years.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And there's some
evidence to suggest

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:10%
that it may have been used
for thousands of years.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It's used for a wide
variety of purposes,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and normally by
indigenous tribes.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It's used most commonly
now for healing.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
a lot of interest

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
from people from the West
going to the Amazon rainforest

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
in order to drink ayahuasca.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And also, ayahuasca is spreading
across the rest of the world

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and now can be found in
pretty much every continent.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Ayahuasca is traditionally
taken with a shaman who

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:10%
channels energy through the
participant to bring about

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:10%
healing, both
psychological and physical.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The more Western explanation
for how the medicine works

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the mechanism by
which its active compound, DMT,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
produces its
psychedelic effects.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When you consume ayahuasca,
a wide variety of things could

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so for many people, they
get changes in their perception.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So they can see things that
they don't normally see, maybe

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that others can't see.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Their thoughts change.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
They might think about
things in a different way.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:84%
There's also lots of
purging, and that can be

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.842 align:middle line:90%
typically vomiting or diarrhea.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be
crying or maybe even

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
laughing, a purging emotion.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Subjectively, it's
incredibly difficult

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to describe an
experience on ayahuasca.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything from
revisiting old memories,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.425 align:middle line:90%
going to distant worlds.

00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people even
believe that you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
can have contact
with entities that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%
don't exist in this dimension.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The biochemical mechanism by
which ayahuasca works has been

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:10%
the focus of multiple studies
over the last several decades.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Recent research has
been looking at the ways

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:10%
in which it reduces activity
in certain parts of the brain.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The place that this is most
obvious is the default mode

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:90%
network.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:84%
So the default mode
network is a collection

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
of what we call connector
hubs within the brain.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
When you consume ayahuasca,
it reduces the activity

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
in the default mode network,
which allows the brain

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to make more connections,
connections that it doesn't

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
normally make so that
parts of the brain

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
are communicating
with each other,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and they don't normally
communicate with each other.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
This practically
means that you see

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:90%
things in a more objective way.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You can think about
things in a different way

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
than the way you do in
your normal waking state.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that
consuming psychedelics

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
makes you physiologically ready
for psychological change, which

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I think is a really
nice way of putting it.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Studies of ayahuasca
have shown its great promise

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:10%
in treating a host of
mental health issues.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
As the use of ayahuasca is not
legal in the United States,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
research has been conducted
in those countries in South

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.385 align:middle line:90%
America, where it is legal.

00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been many
studies that have been done

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
into ayahuasca over
the last 10, 20 years.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
They seem to suggest
that ayahuasca

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is beneficial in treating
conditions such as depression

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It can help people who have
problems with addictions.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It can also reduce things
like panic disorder.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca was found to
be very beneficial, very

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
effective in reducing
people's depression

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that was previously deemed
incredibly difficult to treat.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
What's more, it did this
extremely effectively, so

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
pretty much immediately
after drinking ayahuasca.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Carlos Tanner is the director
of the Ayahuasca Foundation

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:10%
in Peru, where he has witnessed
thousands of ceremonies.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:10%
He founded the center in 2009
as the result of his own healing

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:10%
journey.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> My own personal
transformation is a significant

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.340 align:middle line:10%
one, to say the least.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I was a heroin addict in 2003.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in my car underwater
because I had blacked out

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
behind the wheel while drinking
and driving and doing drugs

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and drove my car into a river.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, had to
figure out where I was,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
climbed out the window
and swam to shore.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
made a declaration

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
that I would do something
drastic to save my life.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that change, for me, was
to go to the Amazon rainforest

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
to drink ayahuasca
with a curandero named

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Don Juan in June of 2003.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, I
saw my childhood traumas.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I saw how I had inaccurately
interpreted the experiences,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.020 align:middle line:90%
how I had put the guilt on me.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I could see it all
play out in my visions

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and yet was also able to affect
change and said I was wrong.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't my fault.
And in that moment,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:90%
release that trauma.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That allowed me to find
true love in myself again,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to love myself
and to release depression

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that had brought me
to suicidal states

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and was really
the cause of why I

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
was choosing to do heroin as a
source of numbing my problems.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I never did
heroin again, and my life

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:90%
was transformed so much.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
The rest is history, I guess.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Carlos's says Riosbo
Research Center at the Ayahuasca

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Foundation was the setting
of a recent study, led by Dr.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Ruffell, in which 63 retreat
participants were assessed

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
before, during, and after a
number of traditional ayahuasca

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
ceremonies.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The findings were
truly compelling.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.945 align:middle line:84%
>> In this study, we
found that participants,

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
their levels of depression had
decreased immediately after

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
drinking ayahuasca, and this
was maintained six months later.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
This is also true for anxiety
and decreased in the short term

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and was maintained
in the long term.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Participants' levels
of mindfulness

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
had increased and had
their self-compassion.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
We also found that they
perceived traumatic events that

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
happened in their life
in a less negative way,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
both in the short term
and six months later.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
We found that participants who
had experienced more childhood

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:84%
trauma had greater degrees of
a decrease in their depression.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And we also found that
the level of which

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.398 align:middle line:84%
a participant underwent
a mystical experience,

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of whether or not
they felt connected

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to God, whether or not
they stepped outside

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
of time, whether or not they
fell out of one with nature,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
was predictive of the
decrease in depression

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:90%
that they would have.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So the greater the mystical
experience, the greater

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:90%
the decrease in depression.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> One finding in particular
was groundbreaking.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Saliva samples showed a
clear epigenetic change

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
had taken place as the result
of the ayahuasca experience,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
making this the first
study of any psychedelic

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
to look at and show
changes in DNA.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, if I were to look
at the epigenetic results

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
of the study, I would
look at the transformation

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
of a personal truth first and
then the genetic expression

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
changing as a result of
the consciousness shift.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> For more on this
revolutionary finding,
