00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> DMT, or n,
n-dimethyltryptamine is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
a highly potent hallucinogen
which naturally occurs in many

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
plant species, including in
one of the plant ingredients

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.550 align:middle line:90%
of ayahuasca.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It can also be synthetically
produced in a laboratory.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
It is known for inducing
intense metaphysical trips which

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
are reportedly similar to
near-death experiences.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Having been used underground
in the West for decades,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
it is now attracting
the interest

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceutical companies
and scientists looking

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.955 align:middle line:84%

for Medicinal Mindfulness.

Based in Boulder, Colorado, it
was one of the first centers

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to offer legal psychedelic
therapy in the US.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:10%
>>JAY: DMT is actually the most
powerful psychedelic on Earth

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:10%
that we're aware of.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:10%
And what makes it
special and different

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:10%
than other psychedelics
is that it's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:10%
endogenous, which means it's
produced within our own bodies.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:10%
It's also produced in nearly
every ecosystem on Earth, which

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:10%
just, it's everywhere,
it's all around us.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Which is also leading into
what is really unique about it.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The extent of the DMT experience
is at most 20 minutes.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> While there is a wide range
of phenomena experienced during

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
a DMT trip, there are some
fascinating common hallmarks.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: This alternate
reality experience,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
or an experience that people
will call realer than real.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.945 align:middle line:84%
It's a reality similar to our
own, but completely different.

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of the elements
within that would

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.240 align:middle line:84%
be the entity encounters, which
is very common for people.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Intense geometric hyperbolic
shapes and out-of-body

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
traveling to the
center of the universe.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Ego dissolution, ego death.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:10%
These are really common
experiences under them.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:10%
>> While advocates have been
reporting profound healing

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:10%
benefits for decades, there have
not been any clinical studies

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:10%
on DMT due to its status as
a schedule one controlled

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:10%
substance.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:10%
Until now.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Canadian pharmaceutical
company Small Pharma

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:10%
recently completed the
first clinical trial

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.500 align:middle line:10%
of DMT-assisted therapy.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:10%
The trial was phase one,
meaning it established

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:10%
the safety and
feasibility of studying

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:10%
the psychedelic in this way.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.670 align:middle line:10%
Small Pharma is now moving
into phase two trials

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:10%
involving patients with
major depressive disorder.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Practitioners like
Jay Waxenberg high

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
hopes that the studies will
bear out DMT's great potential

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.382 align:middle line:84%
for addressing
psychological issues.

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: If somebody has
an ego death or somebody

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
leaves their body, there's
this feeling of expansiveness

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%
that comes with that.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
A feeling of not feeling
trapped in your life.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
depression or anxiety

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
or thought loop patterns
or anything like this,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
often that's the
benefit of that,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
is to break yourself
out of those cycles,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.605 align:middle line:84%
break yourself
out of those loops

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:90%
and those thought patterns.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
In the dying
process, people that

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
are getting terminal
diagnosis, that's

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're
the most benefit

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
can come from DMT,
because it's just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
like instantaneous removal of
the ego and out of your body

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and go into that space.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Experiences that take them
right into what they believe

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
the afterlife process will be
or what they believe the death

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
process will be.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And really watching that be
nourishing and supportive of

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
like, OK, this is
maybe something

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I can actually go toward.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's going to have really
big benefits towards treatment

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
resistant depression.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Like ketamine, it's this
out-of-body experience.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And that alone can help
reset the nervous system,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:84%
reset what your baseline is
of happiness or wellness.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Can just totally
get reset like that.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Many in the psychedelic
therapy world will be watching

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
closely for the results of the
coming DMT-assisted therapy

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:90%
trials.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JAY: So my hope is
just to keep opening

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.600 align:middle line:90%
the door wider and wider.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Can we bring more
and more people

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
into the space,
more and more people

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
into the conversation to see
what these substances can do?

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And really within
this meta crisis

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
we find ourselves
in culturally, I

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:84%
think DMT is an answer to
a lot of those questions.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
How can we really see a
different angle to the problems

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
that we face now?
