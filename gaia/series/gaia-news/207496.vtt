>> Just how powerful
are our thoughts?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.510 align:middle line:10%
Renowned researcher Lynne
McTaggart's recent work

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.510 align:middle line:10%
shows that the power of
setting intention to heal

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.230 align:middle line:10%
is limitless, especially
when done with others.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I've done a lot of
work over the years,

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.810 align:middle line:84%
but this is the most
phenomenal, the most powerful,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:90%
and the most direct.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And new brain research
provides a fascinating

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:90%
explanation.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:10%
Lynne McTaggart has
been on the forefront

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:10%
of researching and facilitating
group intention setting

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:10%
for decades.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Her large scale global
intention experiments

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
have shown the dramatic
power of thoughts

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to affect reality
and promote healing.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Since 2008, the
same effect has been

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
seen in her Power of Eight
groups, in which people send

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and receive healing intentions.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Working like this in a
group, whether they're a sender

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:10%
or a receiver can have pretty
much every aspect of their life

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:10%
healed.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:10%
So we've had extraordinary
healings, everything

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:10%
from people getting up
out of their wheelchair,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:10%
to reversing stage four cancer,
to healing life-threatening

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:10%
sepsis.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
We've also had
people fall in love.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We've had people where they've
needed hundreds of thousands

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:90%
of dollars receive that.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
People who needed
$2,000 receive that.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
We've had people
get new careers--

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
exciting careers.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Vietnam veteran Wes Chapman
is one of the thousands

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
of people who has experienced
profound healing in a Power

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of Eight group.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Having suffered from
major depression

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
for many years
following his service,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Wes had virtually
given up on life

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
when he came across one
of Lynne's workshops

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and took part in
a group healing.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:10%
>> I felt the energy
running through our hands.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:10%
I felt the vibrations
in the room change.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:10%
I felt a very sort of special
atmosphere was being created.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The next morning when I woke
up, it was an amazing thing.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I felt-- the first thing
I felt was this energy.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
wheels are moving.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like I can do what I
need to do, and do it happily.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
When I went to bed
that night-- now,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
this is the second night
after the experience--

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the morning
with a clear memory

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
of the most lucid dream is
what a rational person would

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:90%
call it.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:90%
I call it a vision.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I found myself
back on the campus

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that I was at where
I was drafted.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:84%
My 19-year-old self
was waiting for me.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I felt the most
powerful emotions of love,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:90%
and connection, and joy.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like all of his high hopes,
all of his beautiful dreams,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
all of his optimism, all
of his youthful energy--

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:90%
it's like, wow.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Somehow I left all that behind.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Now with my experience,
and wisdom, and strength,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:10%
and toughness, and his
optimism, and hope, and joy,

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:10%
it's like, hey, I get to start
life all over again at 65.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of
work over the years.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But this is the most
phenomenal, the most powerful,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and the most direct.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Just what accounts for
these significant effects?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an amazing,
extraordinary,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:84%
transformational
effect of groups.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a
collective effervescence.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.600 align:middle line:84%
There's also an extraordinary
thing about oneness

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:90%
that we don't get to experience.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is the secret sauce

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:90%
of group intention-- this.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:84%
When we've done
brainwave studies,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
neuroscientists.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.870 align:middle line:10%
We did a series of brainwave
studies on novice people--

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:10%
people who'd never
done this before--

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.370 align:middle line:10%
who were put into
Power of Eight groups.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:10%
We put an EEG cap on a
member of the group who

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:10%
was doing the sending.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:10%
And we found in every instance,
there were similar brain wave

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:10%
signatures that looked
nothing like meditation,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:10%
but looked everything almost
identical to the same kinds

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.660 align:middle line:10%
of studies looking at Sufi
masters during chanting,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:10%
or Buddhist monks
during ecstatic prayer.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
These are people where the parts
of the brain that make us feel

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
separate all dialed way down.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So these were people
like those Buddhist monks

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:90%
in a state of ecstatic oneness.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And it is my belief that
that altered state--

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:84%
that altered state that occurs
in just 10 minutes with a group

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:90%
intention is responsible.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Because we get to
experience what

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.120 align:middle line:90%
it is to live in the field.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We finally get to feel that and
not feel our own separation.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:10%
And that, I believe,
is the healer.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Lynne continues to offer
the opportunity for people

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:10%
to experience this healing as
part of her ongoing workshops

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:10%
and intention experiments.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
She has a firm conviction
that it has never

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:84%
been more necessary to
do this kind of work.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>> We've all been so isolated.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The science shows us that one
of the most important things

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
we need is not even food
as much as community.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Most of the groups that
I lead are all virtual,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and yet these have
become their new family.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
these small groups

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
not only can heal
each other, but start

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
healing their communities,
creating new communities.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Because small groups are
the way every kind of change

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that we've known in our
human history has got made.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
These Power of Eight groups
can be little crucibles

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.220 align:middle line:84%
of change for the change we
need, the healing we need,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and the connection we
desperately need right now.
