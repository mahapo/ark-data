>> New research suggests that
using binaural beats to entrain

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.330 align:middle line:10%
your brain may not only heal
but may also induce out-of-body

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.930 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.407 align:middle line:90%

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Brainwave entrainment
is a method

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of using pulsing sounds
to stimulate the brain

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:90%
into entering a specific state.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:10%
It has grown in popularity of
late as evidenced by the ever

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:10%
increasing number of available
brainwave entrainment

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:10%
recordings.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Many such recordings are
created using binaural beats--

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
two tones with slightly
different frequencies.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, research is showing
the healing benefits

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
of listening to these binaural
beats on both body and mind.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:10%
Karen Newell is an
author and co-founder

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:10%
of Sacred Acoustics,
a leading creator

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:10%
of brainwave entrainment
audio recordings.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Binaural beats are delivered
by giving you one signal in one

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:10%
ear, a slightly different
signal in the other ear.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:10%
And the result is
a wavering sound.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Binaural beats are
effective in the sense

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:10%
that they are affecting the
brain wave state of the brain.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So our brains put on
an electric signal,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
it's measured with an EEG device
with the names of delta, theta,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
alpha.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We're used to hearing
those words; beta

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that's the state that when
we're walking and we're talking.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the state that
really prevents us

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
from getting into a
quieter state of awareness.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So binaural beats are
designed to bring us

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
into those lower brain wave
states, so help the brain get

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
into a quieter state that's
associated with sleep,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.972 align:middle line:90%
with meditation, and with focus.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> People experience a wide
range of responses to binaural

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
beats, from deep relaxation
to enhanced intuition,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreams, and even
connection with the souls

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of departed loved ones.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:10%
Another fascinating effect
increasingly reported to Newell

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.576 align:middle line:10%
and her team is the
out-of-body experience.

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So an out of body experience
is when your awareness

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
literally leaves
your physical body,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
gives you that firsthand
personal direct experience that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
there is an energy that exists
outside of your body that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
isn't necessarily
reliant on your body.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Out-of-body experiences can
happen incredibly spontaneously

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
without anyone even realizing.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And other people will cultivate
them very consciously.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've had reports from
Sacred Acoustics listeners

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
who write to me and say that
after about 18 months or so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
of regular, almost daily,
listening to our recordings,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
they've started to have these
out-of-body experiences.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it about these
binaural beats that engender

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.936 align:middle line:90%
such experiences?

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:10%
>> The real sweet spot of
binaural beats is that border

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:10%
between awake and asleep.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:10%
We're all in this state,
the hypnagogic state

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:10%
every night as we're falling
asleep we go into this state.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:10%
Every morning, as we wake up.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
This is what binaural
beats can do,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
can bring you into that state.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
This is where the body
becomes extremely relaxed

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and the mind still
stays awake and alert.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
That's where you can start to
make visualizations and imagine

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
your body's energy doing
different things that

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
can help to engender
an out-of-body state.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Anything that gets your mind
off of the physical body

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is the mechanism for having
your energetic body actually

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:90%
move away from it.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:10%
You can also use
that hypnagogic state

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.666 align:middle line:10%
to really reprogram your
deep-seated belief system.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> For Newell and other
proponents of brainwave

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
entrainment, the implications
of this kind of experience are

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:90%
profound.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The real vision of Sacred
Acoustics is to help people get

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in touch with their own infinite
minds, explore with them,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
get behind those
racing thoughts,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
find out who you truly are,
the part of you that is

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:90%
your essence.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And we each can find
out for ourselves, this

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are spiritual beings, a
very important spiritual being

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that's connected to the
larger one mind or one heart,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
one consciousness
that connects us all.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we find that
connection, we're

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.145 align:middle line:84%
able to find real meaning
and purpose in our lives.
