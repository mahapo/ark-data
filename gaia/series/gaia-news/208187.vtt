>> Did ancient Peruvian leaders
use hallucinogens to keep

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.030 align:middle line:90%
their followers in line?

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And does this
elongated skull show

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
evidence of an advanced surgical
implant, or is it just a hoax?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:10%
Archaeologists studying
the Wari people

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
in the southern Peruvian
town of Quilcapampa

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:10%
have found hallucinogenic
vilca seeds in a recent dig.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
Writing in the
journal "Antiquity,"

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.190 align:middle line:10%
the researchers
point out they found

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:10%
16 vilca seeds in an
ancient alcoholic drink

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:10%
called chicha de molle
in an area believed

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:10%
to be used for feasting.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
The Wari people lived in this
area from about 500 to 1,000

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:90%
AD.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Their reverence for the
psychotropic vilca seed

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:10%
has been found in images
at other Wari sites.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the first find
of the actual seeds.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
What is particularly interesting
to the archaeologists

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
is the role of
ancient hallucinogens

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and their influence on
social interactions.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.660 align:middle line:84%
First, the vilca
seeds would have

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
come from tropical woodlands on
the eastern side of the Andes.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
A complex trade network
would have to be in place

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:90%
to even get them.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And adding the vilca seeds
with the alcoholic drink

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
would increase the intensity
of a psychedelic trip.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:10%
That trip would have
been seen as a journey

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:10%
to the spirit world, and
Wari leadership's control

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:10%
over the substance
led to control over

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:10%
their followers who wanted it.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Researchers argue
in their paper,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:10%
"The vilca-infused brew
brought people together

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:10%
in a shared psychotropic
experience, while ensuring

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:10%
the privileged position
of Wari leaders

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:10%
within the social
hierarchy as the providers

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:10%
of the hallucinogen."

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Work continues at the
dig site at Quilcapampa,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
and researchers plan to
test where the ancient vilca

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:84%
seeds came from so
they can figure out

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.635 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the
ancient trade routes.

00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:10%
This Peruvian elongated skull
may show the earliest evidence

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:10%
of ancient metal implant.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.330 align:middle line:10%
LiveScience.com reports
that the skull, which

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:10%
was donated to the Museum of
Osteology in Oklahoma City,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:10%
is elongated and pointed.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
That is not
necessarily noteworthy,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
as ancient Peruvians
used to squeeze and shape

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
the heads of infants.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:10%
But this implant,
if it is genuine,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:10%
could show advanced surgery
using a foreign object.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:10%
Beneath the metal,
there is a hole

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:10%
in the skull
believed to have been

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:10%
made by surgical
trepanation, which

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:10%
is surgical removal of part of
the skull to treat an injury.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:10%
Trepanation in the
Andes was widely

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:10%
practiced until the
early 16th century.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:10%
This skull appears to
show a piece of metal that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:10%
was hammered and molded into
shape to fill and protect

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:10%
the trepanation hole.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:10%
And it appears the man
survived, as there's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:10%
evidence of bones healing
and growing back together.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:10%
But is it real?

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:10%
The Museum of
Osteology has not yet

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:10%
determined if the
metal is genuine

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:10%
or if it was added later.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
As John Verano, anthropology
professor at Tulane University,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
told LiveScience,
"I think this is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
something fabricated to
make the skull a more

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
valuable collectible."

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Verano has studied a
number of Andean skulls

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:10%
with metal plates that
turned out to be fake.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If this metal
plate is a forgery,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
it could have been
added years ago.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
More testing must be
done, but the museum

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
has not yet announced when
those tests will take place.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:10%
If the metal turns
out to be genuine,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:10%
this would be the
first of its kind.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a "Gaia News Breakdown."
