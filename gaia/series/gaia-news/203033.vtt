00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Groundbreaking new studies
reveal the connection between

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.540 align:middle line:10%
your gut health
and mental health.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.210 align:middle line:90%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have known
about the connection

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
between the bacteria
that live in your gut

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and in your brain for some time.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to revealing
how closely they are connected,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
science has just
scratched the surface.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Now in a systematic analysis
published in the journal

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:84%
"Clinical Psychology
Review," researchers

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
looked at 26 studies that
assess the role of gut biology

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:90%
plays in anxiety and depression.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The findings showed people
with anxiety and depression

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
had different levels and
different types of microbes

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
in their gut compared to people
without anxiety and depression.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:10%
The digestive tract of people
with anxiety and depression

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:10%
contained more proinflammatory
bacteria species

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.330 align:middle line:10%
and had less of the type of
bacteria that help regulate

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
the central nervous system.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:10%


00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Naturopathic medical
Donese Worden

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:10%
had this to say on the
gut brain connection.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that everyone's
microbiome or those bugs are

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:10%
like a fingerprint.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Everyone is unique.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.410 align:middle line:10%
None of us look alike.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And the newer studies
are showing us

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
how much more of a link
there is with mental health

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in the combination of
the bugs that we have

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and the diversity
is the big key.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The more diverse the bugs
are, the more bugs you've got

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and types of bugs,
the better off

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.655 align:middle line:84%
you are with mental health
and many other diseases.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do we know how the brain and
digestive tract are so closely

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
connected?

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to those
trillions of microorganisms

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and how they affect us in
this brain-gut immune access,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:90%
we're learning more and more.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of the proposed
mechanisms of how

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:90%
that communication happens--

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
one of them is
through what we call

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:90%
the enteric nervous system.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:90%
That is a communication pathway.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Another one is the vagus nerve.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And that vagus nerve affects
the autonomic nervous system.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And that again is about
the brain, and the gut,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:90%
and how that affects everything.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Others are proposed mechanisms
are tryptophan metabolism,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:90%
how we metabolize that.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system itself
is a communication pathway.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it utilizes those
bugs in good and bad ways.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> How could the study of our
microbiome help treat mental

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
health conditions, as
well as other diseases?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not far enough yet to
say we use this bug for this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
disease, but I think that
we're getting closer.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And we do know certain
ones that look like they

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle line:90%
are helping with cancer.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is that,
in particular, people

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:84%
that are depressed,
they're more likely to have

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
a different species of bacteria
in their digestive tract.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Now remember, we're all unique.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
We have a unique
fingerprint but how do I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:90%
look compared to someone else?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And those differences
we're starting to see

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
plays into, oh, if you have
more of this species of bug,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
you might be more likely to
struggle with depression,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety, or mental
health than if you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.290 align:middle line:90%
have more of these bugs.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
It's about the ratio.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:90%
It's about the diversity.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And someday in the
near future, we'll

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
be able to use
probiotics and the bugs

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:84%
specifically for specific
diseases and that's exciting.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Although this review did
show fascinating results,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
it's important to remember
mental health issues could be

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:90%
caused by multiple factors.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many things
that play into mental health.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome is
only one pathway.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:84%
But we do believe that
the microbiome in that gut

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
may be telling what we call
tyrosine and tryptophan how

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to transform into
serotonin and dopamine.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.082 align:middle line:84%
And that affects
all mental health.

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's exciting
to know that we've

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.880 align:middle line:84%
got some positive,
wonderful things coming down

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:84%
the line that we may be able to
utilize instead of pharmacology

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:90%
for the mental health illnesses.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What can people at home
do with this information?

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we know right now
that can help all of us is that

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
the more diverse the bugs that
we have, more different types,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:90%
the better.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And those bugs, by the
way, will be personal.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
What you should be taking,
saccharomyces boulardii

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
may be good for one person
but not for the next.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So until we know that,
I think it's the safest

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
to say let's rotate
our foods, our

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
probiotics, and remember
that diversity is key.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
health comes in.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The authors of this review
were encouraged by these

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
findings for prevention and
therapy but recommend more

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
research into this area.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Until then, remember to keep a
healthy diet for your physical

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:90%
and mental health.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:10%
