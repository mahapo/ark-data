00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.200 align:middle line:10%
>> A rare planetary
alignment, how to see it,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.860 align:middle line:10%
plus what this means for you
energetically and how you

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.460 align:middle line:10%
should prepare.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.020 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:10%
Since the end of March,
Venus, Mars, and Saturn

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:10%
have appeared to group together.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
But starting April
17th, Jupiter will

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:10%
appear, forming a row
of planets in a line.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.235 align:middle line:84%
It will be most visible in
the predawn sky of April 20th.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the astronomy of
this celestial event,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.020 align:middle line:90%
but what about the astrology?

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:10%
Astrologer Mercedes
Arnus Arraut.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:10%
>> These last two
weeks of April,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:10%
we have something
very special going on.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:10%
I know that astronomically
we can see Saturn.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.432 align:middle line:90%
We can see the moon.

00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
able to see Mars,

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Venus, [LAUGHING] Neptune pretty
much, and Jupiter aligned.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But what we should be really
focusing our attention on,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
at least we should
astrologically,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:84%
is in Venus in Pisces going
through Jupiter and Neptune.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And Mars is going to be doing
the same around a week later.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> How does the energy of each
individual planet come together

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.331 align:middle line:90%
in this alignment?

00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So, to understand this,
we need to know that Venus is

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:90%
the planet of relationships.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Love, value, money,
self-worth and after that,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Mars is going through
Jupiter and Neptune.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And Mars has to do with
our energy, our drive.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy
activator, and it's

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
aligning too with Jupiter, which
is expansion, exaggeration.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And Neptune, that has to
do with spirit, ether,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:90%
lost resolution enveils.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So at this time, we
can really reconnect it

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
with souls that have a
higher purpose in our path.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that are going to
guide us into a much

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
broader understanding of what
unconditional love truly is.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a time really to
experience the most

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:84%
ethereal, hypersensitive, and
spiritual connections we've

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:90%
ever felt.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be a time
for experiencing loss, grief,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:90%
and the dissolution of the veil.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:84%
That will show us the
raw truth or a reality

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
we didn't want to
face very much.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But if we try to stay true
and connect it to our emotions

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and really tap into
the sensitivity

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.735 align:middle line:84%
that it's awakening
within us, it

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
can really be a
very beautiful time

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to channel our most dreamed
reality into matter.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> How should we prepare
ourselves to tap into and take

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:90%
advantage of this energy?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very important that we
stay tuned in to our dreams,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
that we have an
emotional journal,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
that we can have
even a dream journal,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and try to analyze the symbols
that our dreams are giving us.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And especially because
Pisces is the energy

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
dreams in the world.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So we are being
guided at this time,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's important that we
stay true to our subconscious.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much the symbols
that they're giving us

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and stay true to that and
follow every relationship,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:90%
every connection.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Try to stay open to what others
are showing you about yourself.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> To best see this alignment
look east about 45 minutes

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
before sunrise.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
As amazing as this
alignment will be,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
it is just a dress
rehearsal for June

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of this year, where Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:90%
Neptune, and Uranus will align.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:10%
