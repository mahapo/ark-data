00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Did prehistoric man
communicate with non-human

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.980 align:middle line:10%
entities?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.630 align:middle line:84%
An exciting new archeological
study of ancient European caves

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.760 align:middle line:90%
may have just found an answer.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.550 align:middle line:10%
Caves have always been
a source of fascination,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
as have the paintings made in
them by the earliest humans.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:84%
There's been much debate
among archeologists

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
over the meaning
of these paintings,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:84%
as well as why so many
were made in the deepest,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.470 align:middle line:90%
hardest to reach parts of caves.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:10%
A team from Tel Aviv
University set out

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:10%
in search of the answer.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:10%
Archeologist Ran
Barkai led the study,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:10%
which focused on caves
painted in Spain and France

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.110 align:middle line:10%
some 40,000 years ago.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:10%
>> We were wondering about
human relationships with caves.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:10%
Caves are not only
shelters from the elements.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:10%
We believe that caves
had much more deeper

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:10%
meaning for early humans.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why people
entered deep and dark caves

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:10%
was always on the table.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.775 align:middle line:10%
And even after 100
years of research,

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:10%
there's no answer for that.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:10%
A few years ago a few papers
came out showing evidence

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:10%
that in decorated
caves in Europe

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
people were using
torches in order

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:10%
to light the way in
the cave, and in order

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:10%
to make these
depictions on the wall.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:10%
When we go to the idea that the
use of torches inside the cave

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:10%
must have had en effect on the
oxygen level in the cave and we

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:10%
simulated the effect of
the use of artificial light

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:10%
in deep and dark caves.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The researchers' findings
were groundbreaking.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.260 align:middle line:10%
>> And they came to realize that
the use of torches must have

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:10%
reduced the level of
oxygen inside caves,

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:10%
which brings a well-known
phenomenon which is called

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:10%
hypoxia.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
consequences of hypoxia

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:10%
is altered states
of consciousness.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:10%
You can get hallucinations while
being in a state of hypoxia.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:10%
And we came to the idea
that people intentionally

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:10%
went into deep and dark
caves with artificial light

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:10%
because they were aware of
the transformative nature

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:10%
of this oxygen-depleted space.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:10%
And we suggested that
this is the reason

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:10%
they made the depictions
in deep and dark caves.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The findings led researchers
to draw some fascinating

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:10%
conclusions.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:10%
>> We believe, and there's a
lot of evidence about that,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:10%
both from recent humans,
the caves were conceived

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:10%
as portals, as gates
to the underworld.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.436 align:middle line:10%
They could see the underworld
as a world of prosperity

00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:10%
or as the place of
origin of all things.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:10%
We believe in their
opinion, the end of the cave

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:10%
was the connection
to the netherworld

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:10%
and they wanted to get
this connection in order

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:10%
to communicate and maintain
their relationships

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:10%
with the entities which are in
the other side of the world.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Animals and geometric
signs are the primary subjects

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:10%
of most of these paintings,
which were executed with

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:10%
an amazing level of
artistic ability,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:10%
especially considering
the time and conditions.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:10%
>> While going through altered
state of consciousness,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.448 align:middle line:10%
they saw the animals within
their vision and then they

00:03:48.448 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:10%
painted them on the wall.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:10%
They didn't go there
to see animals.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:10%
They went in order to get
attached to the cosmos

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:10%
and via that, they saw
things within their vision,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:10%
and they put them on the wall.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Andrew Collins, an ancient
history researcher and writer

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:10%
on the significance
of this study.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The greatest takeaway, in my
opinion relating to this study,

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:10%
is not so much the fact that
they come up with this idea,

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:10%
which is revolutionary
in itself,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:10%
but it's the fact that academics
are seriously considering

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.695 align:middle line:10%
the idea that we are
communicating with non-human

00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:34.360 align:middle line:10%
intelligences, and
these entities,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.920 align:middle line:10%
these beings might
well have been real.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to
try and understand

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:90%
exactly what those entities are.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:10%
>> For Ran Barkai, there's
an even bigger takeaway.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:10%
>> It is my understanding after
spending many years of studying

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:10%
early humans, I believe that we
can learn the lesson from them.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:10%
Their consciousness
was much wider than us.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:10%
They were much more
connected to the cosmos.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:10%
They realized that their
actions have a price.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:10%
And I think they were
much more concerned

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:10%
about their relationships
with world than we are.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> While more research is
being planned on the topic,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
these findings offer an
extraordinary glimpse

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
into the consciousness of
our earliest ancestors.
