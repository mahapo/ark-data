00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.420 align:middle line:10%
>> A new discovery
from ancient Egypt.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.460 align:middle line:10%
More than 100 tombs found from
the time before the pharaohs.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.790 align:middle line:10%
Egyptian archeologists have
unearthed 110 burial tombs

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:10%
at an ancient site in
a Nile Delta province.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:10%
This new find includes
68 tombs dating

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:10%
to the pre-Dynastic period
from 6000 to 3150 BC,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:10%
as well as five oval shaped
tombs from the Naqada III

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:10%
period that spanned from
around 3200 to 3000 BC,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:10%
and 37 rectangular graves from
the Second Intermediate Period

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
when the Hyksos people
ruled ancient Egypt.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists also found human
remains of adults and children

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
and pottery in the graves.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists make significant
findings around the world.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:10%
What makes this one stand out?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Jack Cary, researcher and
author of Paranormal Planet.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, in this particular
find, it's one of a kind.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
It's the first time they've
found a compilation of tomb

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:10%
stretching this wide
across an expanse of time.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It's going to change the
Egyptian history books

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
and give the scholars
something to study and talk

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:90%
about for quite a while.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
the collision of two

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.960 align:middle line:84%
cultures and one always
affects the other, usually

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in the belief system arena
and the idea of the afterlife

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:90%
in these religious beliefs.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And here, you're getting an
example of three different time

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
eras that were
basically interrupted

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
by a foreign people.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So this gives them all
kinds of different aspects

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
to look at as far as how
these cultures ended up

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
colliding and then how
much of an element one

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
took from the other as
they've moved forward in time.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of the tombs were oval.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And some, during the Hyksos
period, were rectangular.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:10%
What do the shapes
of the tombs mean?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The significance of the
different shapes of the tombs

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
that were discovered-- some
oval, some rectangular--

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
provides insight into the
changing belief systems of what

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:90%
happens in the afterlife.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You see a direct correspondence
between funerary ceremonies

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and that belief.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And here, it looks like
in the oval-shaped tomb,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to reproduce
like the mother's womb.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The bodies were laid
on their left side

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:84%
with their heads pointed
west in a fetal position.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the place of the
setting sun taking them down

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld
for their rebirth.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And the rectangular tombs
show a change in that.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And that change is probably
very, very important

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to Egyptologists who
are trying to determine

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
just how much of an
influence these tribes had

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:90%
on Egyptian culture at the time.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>> How could this change in
belief systems affect aspects

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian
life and the afterlife?

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Egypt is the land
of eternal mystery,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is just scientists
chipping away at a lot

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of unanswered questions
about Egypt that feed

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:90%
into the mysteries.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The religious mysteries,
school mysteries

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
were made up of
these same people

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're finding
in these tombs.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to everything

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that we study about Egypt,
the Egyptian Book of the Dead

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and the funerary
practices, which do

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
seem to have some sort of
spiritual, supernatural aspect

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
That all came about through all
of those early interactions.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It could be that this puts
them on the trail of beginning

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand where the basic
knowledge of Egyptian cosmology

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of the
underworld and of death

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:90%
actually came from.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Some Egyptologists would
have us believe the history

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt
is set in stone.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn
from these tombs?

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This finding proves more
than ever that Egyptology is

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
a completely ongoing,
emerging, evolving science.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And they've seemed
to have only touched

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:84%
upon all of the finds that
are actually buried there

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
in the sand, and this is
a perfect example of that.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is as big
a discovery as this

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is, in the ancient
past of Egypt,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
this is yet just one small
piece of the overall puzzle.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:10%
>> 110 tombs, 110 people with
their own hopes and dreams.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:10%
Some did not spend much
time on this Earth?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:10%
Who were these people
and how did they live?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:84%
This discovery may
help us reinterpret

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
ancient Egyptian
history and put together

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
the pieces of this
ancient puzzle.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.870 align:middle line:10%
