>> As the saying goes,
it's nothing personal.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.510 align:middle line:10%
It's business.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.330 align:middle line:10%
But for author Patricia
Aburdene the worlds

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.460 align:middle line:10%
of business and
money can and should

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.150 align:middle line:10%
be deeply connected to
who we are as individuals.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:10%
I spoke with her earlier about
her new book Conscious Money

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
on how one can integrate
personal values

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:10%
with personal finance.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Newly released book
Conscious Money.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Before the title, you
say, living, creating,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
and investing with your
values for a sustainable

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
new prosperity.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:10%
What is conscious money?

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Conscious money may sound
like a big undertaking,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:10%
but it's really very simple.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:10%
It is comprised of
three simple steps.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:10%
Start within.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Conscious money isn't about your
checking account or your stock

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:90%
portfolio or your expenses.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.687 align:middle line:90%
It's about you.

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Know yourself.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Second part is money
is part of life.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:10%
And we all have relationships
with organizations

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:10%
that fulfill our roles as
an earner, as a spender,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:10%
as an investor.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Choose those
relationships wisely.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And I show you how
to do it in the book.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The third part is to
remember this information

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and this wisdom as you go about
your roles, your economic roles

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
as a consumer, as an investor,
and as an earner of money.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it simple.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is awareness.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Conscious money is about making
financial choices with greater

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
awareness, with
financial choices that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
are informed by our
values, while we also

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
observe the basic rules
of good financial sense.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The way to be successful
today, whether you're

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
a conscious capitalist or
you're a high tech engineer,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
is your ability to
be in the present.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> This book is not
about getting rich quick.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
You basically spell
out four components

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
of conscious choices.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:10%
What are they?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the "get rich
quick" mentality reflects

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:10%
the traditional
thinking about money,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:10%
which also states that values
play no role whatsoever

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:10%
in your financial choices.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, I think this is definitely
an error because values

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:10%
shape your choices.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And your choices write
the story of your life

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:90%
and your financial life.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So values can help you make
good financial decisions

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:84%
because values
activate the heart.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
You also want to honor sound
financial principles that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:90%
activates the mind.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And when the heart
and the head are

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
going in the same direction,
that is a powerful thing

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:90%
because it activates choice.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:84%
When your head
and your heart are

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
going in the same direction,
your emotions are steady.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to make silly
mistakes, emotional mistakes.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Your head is clear.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:90%
And your course is set.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And in difficult
financial times,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
it's better not to
be jumping around

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to all these
different strategies,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
but to have thought
about it and to have

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.180 align:middle line:84%
decided what your
course of action

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
is going to be financially.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that really sums up
the entire core of your book.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all about making more
and more conscious choices.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you make those
choices consciously,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
you benefit yourself,
you benefit your money,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
you benefit other people,
and you benefit the planet

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:90%
at large.
