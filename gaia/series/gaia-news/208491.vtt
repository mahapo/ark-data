>>NARRATOR: Following
decades of being excluded

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.790 align:middle line:10%
from clinical
studies, women today

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.430 align:middle line:10%
suffer the dire consequences.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Can new research finally
reverse the misunderstandings

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and help women harness the
power of their unique biology?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>KAYLA OSTERHOFF: What we
as women have to understand

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is this biological
complexity that keeps us out

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:84%
of the research is
actually our superpower.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.456 align:middle line:90%

>>[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:10%
Kayla Ostheroff is a
neuropsychophysiologist

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:10%
studying the
mind-body connection,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:10%
with a focus on women's health.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:10%
>>OSTERHOFF: Well, most people
are probably not aware of this,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:10%
but women actually represent the
largest gap in health science

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:10%
research that exists today.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.600 align:middle line:84%
This is perpetuated by a problem
that actually manifested back

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
in 1977, when the
FDA formally banned

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
all women of
childbearing potential

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:90%
from all clinical research.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
That ban remained in
effect until 1993.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, the
damage has been done,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and women are still left out
of the clinical research.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason why women are left
out of the clinical research

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
is that women are
biologically complex.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that they are
biologically, biochemically,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and physiologically
shifting constantly

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:84%
because of our
female hormone cycle

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:90%
that drives our physiology.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The other reason is that women
are risky research subjects,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they can
become pregnant at any time

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:90%
during the study.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So while this is understandable
from an ethical standpoint,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
it cannot remain in effect,
because women are really being

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
disempowered by this gap.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: The repercussions
of this scientific gap

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
have been profound and were
highlighted in a recent study.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: From 1997
to today, what they

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
found is that most of the
drugs that have been removed

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
from the US market were
removed because of side-effects

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that occurred mainly or
exclusively in women.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Women represent 78% of
all autoimmune diseases.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And women suffer from
depression two times more

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:90%
than their male counterparts.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And women experience
burnout 200% more than men.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: These
serious consequences

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
all stem from the
misunderstanding of what

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Osterhoff calls the missing
link in women's health.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: The
missing link is this.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
That women are essentially
physiologically four

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
different people over
the course of a month.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And this is because our
biology, our physiology,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:10%
our biochemistry is
constantly shifting

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:10%
with the ebb and flow
of our female hormones

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:10%
throughout the month.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
These two key hormones of
estrogen and progesterone

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
impact a woman's
global physiology.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Emerging
research is finally

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
starting to bear out the
specific physiological

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
characteristics of
these biorhythms.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Osterhoff has gone
one step further

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
to examine how these
four distinct phases can

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
be leveraged by women to
better navigate their lives

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and promote wellness
throughout the cycles.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: What we as
women have to understand

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is this biological
complexity that keeps us out

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
of the research is
actually our superpower.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Because of these
neurological shifts

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that happen in
phase one, a woman

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:84%
experiences increased cognitive
empathy, AKA intuition.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Phase two, we have
a greater ability

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:90%
for navigation and strategy.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
In phase three, our cognitive
ability is charisma.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
We are more influential
in this phase.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Now phase four is what
I call the brainy phase.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
We have a heightened
ability to learn and grow.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: How can
women and society

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:90%
best use these understandings?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OSTERHOFF: For women
to be properly supported,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
it would look like understanding
that we are constantly

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:90%
shifting.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And that we require
different environments,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
different infrastructures,
and different support systems

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
through the different
phases of our biology.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So the key takeaway
here is that we

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
need to include women
in research equally.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.800 align:middle line:84%
We also need to do specific
studies focused primarily just

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.150 align:middle line:84%
on women so that we can start
to shift the way that we view

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and support women in this world.
