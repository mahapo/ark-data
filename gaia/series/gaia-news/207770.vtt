00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Most young children show
signs of creative genius.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550 align:middle line:10%
But over time, those
numbers drop significantly.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.220 align:middle line:84%
A new study on how
young children learn

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.410 align:middle line:84%
could help parents
teach their children

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and help answer the question
of nature, versus nurture.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.185 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:10%
In 1968, a study conducted by
George Land and Beth Jarman

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:10%
found that 98% of children were
considered creative geniuses

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:10%
by NASA's standards.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But as this group grew
older, that number

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
dropped off rapidly.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
At age 10, it fell to 30%.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:90%
By age 15, it dropped to 12%.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And by adulthood,
it was just 2%.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:10%
Today researchers at
Birkbeck University in London

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:10%
are using brainwave
scanning caps

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:10%
to look inside the
brains of toddlers

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:10%
while they complete
various tasks.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Artie Wu, an expert on
parenting, relationships,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
and finding your bliss,
weighs in on the subject.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Children come out, they
see the world as it is,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.840 align:middle line:10%
they don't know, there is no
filter between brain and mouth.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But this is the genius view,
they see the world as it is,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:90%
not as it should be.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.657 align:middle line:84%
The aperture has
not tightened down,

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.740 align:middle line:84%
they just see everything
as it is and they say it.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
We typically need to do some
bit of trimming, training,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
educating for them to be
able to get along in life.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The way we do the enforcement
is through shaming.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of NASA's creative
genius tests determined whether

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
a subject showed
divergent thinking,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
also known as thinking
outside the box.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Children have these ideas often.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But as we get older, we become
afraid of expressing them out

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:90%
of fear of being wrong.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So the difference
between shame and guilt is,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
guilt is there something
transactionally that's often

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:90%
"we can fix that."

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And shame is there's something
intrinsically wrong with me.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Especially to a
seven-year-old, they

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
don't know the difference
between guilt and shame

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
so they feel like
they are loved less.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Because of the shaming
mechanism we use,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
what ends up being instilled
in the kid is that my love is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
conditional, there's something
I can actually do which

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:90%
will cause me to lose love.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What with the
opposite look like?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.465 align:middle line:84%
What if we were encouraged as
children, instead of shamed?

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Artie Wu points out the
story of young Pablo Picasso.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Even as a boy, he was
apparently so good that his

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
father came to Picasso and the
father gave him, gave Picasso,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
his own brushes and said, you
are so good I cannot paint

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm done and you are now
the painter of the family.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Picasso-- I don't know,
seven, eleven, whatever.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, talk
about self-esteem.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So the eternal
question is, was there

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
something in Picasso,
that 98% genius that

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
was preserved by that kind of
upbringing and environment?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But then the implication
is like, well,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:90%
what are you saying, Artie?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying
we're all Picassos

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and we've just lost this
expression of our inner Picasso

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:90%
because of this?

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The researchers at Birkbeck
University hope to use the same

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
technology in the future to
study adults and may prove that

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
we have a genius hidden
inside all of us.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
