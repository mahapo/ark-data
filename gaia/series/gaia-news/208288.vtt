>> Can planets possess
their own intelligence?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.860 align:middle line:10%
And if so, how could that
help fix problems on Earth

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.160 align:middle line:10%
and find intelligent
life on other planets?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Could Earth or any other planet
develop planetary intelligence?

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:10%
That's what
astrophysicist Adam Frank

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:10%
of the University of
Rochester and his colleagues

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:10%
have proposed in their paper
published in the International

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:10%
Journal of Astrobiology.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They pulled ideas from
the Gaia hypothesis

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that all living
organisms on Earth

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.750 align:middle line:84%
interact with
inorganic organisms

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to regulate their conditions
necessary for life,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:84%
making the planet a
self-regulating organism.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:10%
They looked at how,
quote, the appearance

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:10%
of technological
intelligence may represent

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:10%
a kind of planetary
scale transition,

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
and thus might be seen not
as something which happens

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:10%
on a planet but to a planet.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.590 align:middle line:84%
They argue, to understand
the evolution of life,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:84%
we must study the
planet as a whole

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
instead of individual species.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:10%
Their definition of
planetary intelligence

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:10%
is the acquisition
and application

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:10%
of collective knowledge
operating at a planetary scale

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.280 align:middle line:10%
which is integrated into the
function of coupled planetary

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:10%
systems.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Consider photosynthesis.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
For the first two billion
years, Earth's atmosphere

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
was mainly molecular
nitrogen, carbon dioxide,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and some oxygen. The
evolution of photosynthesis

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
by bacteria led to the
great oxygenation event

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:90%
about 2.5 billion years ago.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
The planet itself was changed
by bacteria and plants,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
creating oxygen and making the
atmosphere habitable for life.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
As more life grew, they
became complex systems,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
a feedback loop that grew
more life, eventually leading

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth we know today.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So how can we use
this knowledge?

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The researchers say
we can use the concept

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of planetary intelligence to
study Earth and exoplanets,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
our current geological
age and the future

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of human sustainability,
and the search

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
for extraterrestrial
intelligence.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:10%
The researchers say
there are four stages

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:10%
of planetary evolution.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Stage 1, immature
biosphere, very early Earth.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Stage 2, mature biosphere
from about 2.5 billion to 540

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
million years ago.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Characterized by continents,
vegetation and photosynthesis

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and the ozone layer developed.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Stage 3, immature technosphere.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:90%
This is where we are now.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:10%
And stage 4, mature
technosphere.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
This is the hope for
the future, where

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
human technology works
with the natural biosphere,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
not against it.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
By studying where we came from
in terms of the planet working

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
as an intelligent being that
has evolved to grow life,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
we can figure out
how to fix problems

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
we are facing in order to
have a more sustainable planet

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
As Frank told SciTech
Daily, the biosphere

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
figured out how to host life
by itself billions of years

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
ago by creating systems
for moving around nitrogen

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and transporting carbon.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to figure out how
to have the same kind of self

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
maintaining characteristics
with the technosphere.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The researchers added
that understanding

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
the Earth's evolution of
planetary intelligence

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
could help in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
It stands to reason that
if it worked for Earth,

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
this would work
on other planets.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Frank argues, the search
for technosignatures

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
from other planets could be the
way to find intelligent life,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
telling SciTech Daily, "the
only technological civilizations

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
we may ever see, the ones
we should expect to see

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
didn't kill themselves,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:84%
meaning they must have reached
the stage of a true planetary

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:90%
intelligence."

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The researchers hope to
continue this line of study

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to further break down planetary
intelligence in more detail.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective, this
is a Gaia News Breakdown.
