00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.830 align:middle line:10%
>> New discoveries at the
ancient site of Karahan Tepe,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.820 align:middle line:10%
the sister site of Gobekli
Tepe, may have just revealed its

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.260 align:middle line:10%
hidden origins and proved an
ancient civilization is even

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.970 align:middle line:10%
older than once thought.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.545 align:middle line:10%
This is "Gaia News."

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists working
at the ancient site

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
of Karahan Tepe about 30
miles east of its sister site,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, have found
stunning carved heads, standing

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:84%
stones, buttresses, and what
appear to be snakes prominently

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:90%
carved into the Earth.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:10%
The dig is being led by
the University of Istanbul

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:10%
and, in their official
report, point out that

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:10%
not only are these and
other Neolithic structures

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of
architecture but also held

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:10%
a symbolic purpose,
writing, quote,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:10%
"They also bear traces of
the conceptual transformation

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:10%
of the space.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:10%
It is during this period when
the building was instilled

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:10%
to mean something other than
a space to live in, whereby

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:10%
the construction of the first
shelters was followed by that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:10%
of 'special structures.'"

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:10%
Science and history
writer Andrew Collins

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:10%
has visited and studied
Karahan Tepe since 2004.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
He is currently giving
his in-depth analysis

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
on his YouTube channel and has
seen these special structures

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%
up close.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The main structures were all
what they call subterranean.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:10%
They were cut deep
down into the bedrock.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:10%
One was a huge elliptical
enclosure, stone enclosure.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, this was a amphitheater
for ceremonial ritual activity,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:10%
and yet this connected
via a hole which

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:10%
is 70 centimeters in diameter,
into a very strange room

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:10%
containing 11 stone
pillars, 10 of which

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:10%
are actually carved out
of the bedrock itself,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:10%
and sticking out of
the wall of this room

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:10%
that I call the
Pillar Shrine, is

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:10%
this elongated neck with a head
on the end of it, carved stone

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:10%
head.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
This confined room is
somewhere where initiates--

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:84%
people looking for
connection or communication

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of otherworldly
force or influence or deity

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
would come to do their
attunement in altered states

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What can we learn from the
detailed subterranean carvings

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and the positioning
of the structures?

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> From what we can see at
Karahan Tepe and the method

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
of construction and design,
we're dealing with a mentality,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
a mindset that is already very
sophisticated and its ideas

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:90%
of what it wants to achieve.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
We have found that there
are astronomical alignments

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
associated with these new
discoveries at Karahan Tepe.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the large
elliptical enclosure

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
is connected with the
so-called Pillar Shrine,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and the actual alignment
between those two

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
takes you to another hill
locally called Kecili Tepe.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.340 align:middle line:84%
This alignment would
take you directly

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to where the bright star Deneb
in the constellation of Cygnus,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
also known as the Northern
Cross, which set down,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and with the same
position as Cygnus

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
is the Milky Way that
would be seen rising up

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
into the sky at that moment.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:10%
These alignments tell us that
this focus towards the Milky

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:10%
Way, the place of souls,
the place of the dead,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:10%
the place of the
afterlife, is suggesting

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:10%
that they were perhaps drawing
across from that other hill

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:10%
to Karahan some kind of energy
associated with the ancestors.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that we are
dealing with a culture.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
They knew what
they wanted to do,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:84%
they knew what they wanted
to achieve by creating

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:90%
a complex like this.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe,
discovered in 1994,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:10%
was considered by many
mainstream archeologists to be

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:10%
a one-off that should not
have existed but did only

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:10%
as an anomaly.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins and others
have argued for years,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:10%
this was part of an
older, lost civilization.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest takeaways that
we can take from Karahan Tepe

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and the excavations going on
there now is that Gobekli Tepe

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:90%
was not simply an anomaly.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Karahan Tepe shows
us that we are

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a high
culture that existed

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.610 align:middle line:90%
as early as 11,500 years ago.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We have barely scratched
the surface at Karahan Tepe,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:10%
but what can we infer from
what we have learned so far?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're on a learning
curve with Karahan Tepe now.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
What's very clear
so far is that they

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
were working towards
some premeditated design.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I strongly believe
that it's got something

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to do with understanding
what we would call

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic source, the force
that manipulates nature, that

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:84%
creates life, and it's something
that shamans, initiates,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
aspirants would achieve
during altered states

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, during
what we'd call death trances.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
recognized something when,

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in these states, that they
needed to know more about.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the serpent is
the symbol of cosmic knowledge

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic wisdom, and that
is, to me, the best evidence

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
so far that we have to
suggest that this is correct,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that the builders
of Karahan Tepe

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
were looking for the
ultimate cosmic knowledge.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:10%
