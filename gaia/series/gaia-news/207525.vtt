repeating sacred sounds can

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.520 align:middle line:10%
have a powerful effect on

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Mantra, new science on
an ancient practice.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Many traditions and religions
of all over the world have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.050 align:middle line:84%
understood the power of uttering
sacred sound to make better

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
contact with divinity and
fostering our spiritual health.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
The practice of mantra, or the
repetition of sacred sounds,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
has been an integral part
of many spiritual traditions

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Today, exciting new
research is scientifically

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
validating the profound
psychological and physiological

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.750 align:middle line:84%
benefits of this
ancient practice.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Shamini Jain is a
leader in the emerging

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:10%
field of biofield science and
author of "Healing Ourselves."

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
She knows mantra
repetition to be

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
a highly effective tool
for consciousness expansion

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes we get so bogged
down in the conditioned mind,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:10%
that we find it harder
to reach our spirit.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:10%
So mantra is a tool for
us to reach our spirit,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:10%
whether we call that god, deep
consciousness, higher self.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.660 align:middle line:10%
There are many names for it,
but it's really a technique

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:10%
for transcending the minds.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:10%
And it can be something that's
spoken out loud, literally

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:10%
like repeating a word out loud.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It can also be something
that we repeat silently.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
It can also be sung.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And many traditions, almost
all global traditions,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
really have some
sort of practice

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
where they utter sacred sound.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In ancient traditions, the
primary function of mantra was

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the divine.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> In these traditions,
there was a deep relationship

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
of sound with consciousness.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
By working with mantra in
these ancient traditions,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
it was leading you to
expand your consciousness,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be in better
contact with divinity.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
>> With the growing interest in
studying these ancient systems,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
scientific research is now
starting to explore the ways

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:84%
in which mantra may
affect the body and mind.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
One recent focus
of the study has

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.967 align:middle line:84%
been on the effect of mantra
on psychological conditions.

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a body of literature
that has been published

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
for example by Dr. Jill Bormann
at University of California,

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:90%
San Diego.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And she examined what they
called, "mantram" repetition,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
which was essentially the
uttering of a sacred sound.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They've done studies for
example with veterans with PTSD,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
or post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
showing reductions
in PTSD symptoms

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
for those who repeated a
sacred word or phrase, compared

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
to just repeating something
that had no spiritual meaning.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Other recent studies are
showing the effect of mantra

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
on physiological
markers of health.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the strongest
data that we see with mantra

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:84%
practice is the
effect on the heart.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we actually see that
practicing different forms

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of mantra, whether
it's Buddhist,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or Hindu, or other
traditions has

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:84%
an effect on reducing
blood pressure

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and improving
cardiovascular health.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:84%
There are some
studies also looking

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
at this in terms of heart rate
variability, which is really

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the dynamic dance of your
autonomic nervous system.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Anyway you look at
it, the data are

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.520 align:middle line:84%
pretty clear that
mantra meditation

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
has a profound effect
on heart health.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet another groundbreaking
study has shown that mantra

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
repetition in the
form of kirtan,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.555 align:middle line:84%
or call and response singing,
has an effect on cell aging.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They found not only
reductions in mental

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and emotional suffering, such
as stress and other factors.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
They found increases in
markers of cell aging.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Specifically they saw shifts
in an enzyme called telomerase,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.950 align:middle line:84%
which helps to protect
ourselves against aging.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> While the healing effects
of mantra practice are clear,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
scientists are working on
understanding the mechanism

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%
behind which this works.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
One fascinating recent
study looked closely

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.379 align:middle line:90%
at brain function.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the brain, a
really interesting study that

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
was published in a top tier
journal, "Nature Report,"

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
looked at the effects
of Buddhist meditation

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and chanting, particularly
compared to just chanting

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:90%
regular words.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
what they found

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
was, first of all, the
chanting of the Buddhist words

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
by these people who were just
being trained in how to do it,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
resulted in increased
delta waves.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Enhanced delta wave
activity has been found

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:90%
in many forms of meditation.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Those increased delta
waves in the brain

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.760 align:middle line:84%
seem to be connected to
the meditator, in this case

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
the chanters, experience of
an expanded sense of self

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:90%
that was beyond conditioning.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> As there are many ways
to practice mantra, Dr.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Jain recommends finding a
tradition that you resonate

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
with and an experienced
teacher to guide your practice.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jain has high hopes that
scientific interest in mantra

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:90%
continues and deepens.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There needs to be more
research in mantra meditation,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
specifically integrating
some of the perspectives from

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.980 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual practitioners
as well as things like brain

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.790 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these practices
were really meant for us

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to have whole person
well-being, which

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
means spiritual, physical,
emotional, social, relational.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
type of research

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that we want to see
with mantra meditation.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Where we're not just
looking at one brain factor,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
but we're really looking
at the whole person.
