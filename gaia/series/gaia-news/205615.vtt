>> With cognitive
decline on the rise,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.780 align:middle line:10%
a search for solutions has
never been more pressing.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.020 align:middle line:84%
A groundbreaking recent
study on intermittent fasting

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the way
we time our eating

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.219 align:middle line:84%
may play a significant
role in our brain health.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.795 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia News.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, people have

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
been fasting for religious
and spiritual reasons

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
while reaping a host
of physical benefits.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, however, the
standard Western diet

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
has left many overfed
but undernourished.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:10%
While fasting
practices are not new,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:10%
there is a host of
new research showing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:10%
that they may be an important
key to preserving health

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:10%
in a time of disease
Dr. Edward Group

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:10%
is a naturopathic
physician who has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:10%
been incorporating fasting
in his practice for years

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:10%
with great success.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Fasting's something that's
been used for thousands

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:10%
of years actually.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:10%
And it's nothing
more than really

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:10%
giving your body the time
it needs to heal itself.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The human race right now eats
probably 10 times or more

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:84%
the amount of food that we
need to repair and regenerate.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is all of
that builds up and builds up

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a lot of our
energy to be able to digest

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:90%
all of this stuff.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see
the benefits of healing.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You see the benefits
of neurocognition.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
You see the benefits
of weight loss.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You see the benefits of
multiple different conditions

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that people may be
suffering from just

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
by reducing the amount of
food that you're eating.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:10%
And it frees up the
energy through your body

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:10%
to heal and regenerate.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. John Douillard is
an Ayurvedic practitioner

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:10%
and researcher who also sees
the enormous benefits of fasting

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:10%
protocols.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Intermittent fasting, time
restricting eating, you know,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:10%
calorie restriction,
they're all really,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:10%
really well-studied to support
a host of benefits from weight

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.470 align:middle line:10%
loss to lower blood pressure
to better metabolic activity,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:10%
blood sugar, you know,
cholesterol triglycerides,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:10%
all of that.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
benefit for not eating.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
In one study, the average
American eats 100% of the food

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that they need and then
they go and eat another 100%

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
they don't actually need.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.297 align:middle line:84%
And if the studies
show that if you just

00:02:31.297 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
take 30% less of the
extra 100%, then you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:90%
have all these amazing benefits.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So it really does work.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it particularly
works well in America,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
because we eat and
overeat way too much.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> While there are a number of
different fasting techniques,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
intermittent fasting has
especially risen in popularity

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of late, both because of its
relative ease and its unique

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Intermittent fasting
is nothing more than just

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:84%
extending the amount of
time before your next meal.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Skip dinner and don't
eat anything after five

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
or skip breakfast.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good start to ease
in by just skipping one meal.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Even skipping one meal
will give your body

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:90%
more energy to heal itself.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Intermittent fasting was the
subject of one recent study,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.970 align:middle line:10%
in respect to its specific
effect on cognition and memory.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Researchers studying mice
compared a control group

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that received a standard
diet of daily feeding,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
a group on a daily
calorie restricted diet,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and an intermittent fasting
group in which the mice were

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:90%
fed every other day.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:10%
Remarkably, only the mice in
the intermittent fasting group

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated improved
long-term memory retention

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:10%
compared to the other groups.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And the results of the study
showed that the intermittent

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.020 align:middle line:84%
fasting actually activated
the klotho gene, which,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:84%
which is the longevity gene that
we have inside our system that

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
works all throughout our system
to help preserve the telomeres

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:90%
and help regenerate the nerves.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Specifically, the study
found that the klotho gene plays

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:10%
a central role in the
production of new neurons

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:10%
in the hippocampus, a process
known as neurogenesis.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
These neurons are important
for memory formation.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And their production
declines with age.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Researchers hope that the
neurogenesis activated

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
by the klotho gene
has the potential

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to slow the advance of cognitive
decline in older people.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
For doctor group, the effects
of fasting on the brain

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
go beyond genetic upregulation.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> With what we've evaluated
with fasting is it's a lot more

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
than just looking
at a longevity gene.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
That does give us some
scientific evidence,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:84%
but we've also
found that there's

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of chemicals,
a lot of toxins

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:90%
that are in the brain tissue.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We found that the root cause
of all negative conditions

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more than an
accumulation of a toxic gut,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:90%
a toxic liver, a toxic body.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
is these chemicals

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and these toxins
are the ones that

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:90%
degrade these neuropathways.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that alter
the electrical conductivity

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:90%
of these neural pathways.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So what we believe is that
the intermittent fasting

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and water-only fasting,
the first thing that it's

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
doing to repair or to
initiate this neurogenesis

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
is it's detoxifying the negative
things or the negative toxins

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%
that are in the brain tissue.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Douillard has another
theory on why intermittent

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
fasting may be so beneficial
to cognitive function.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>> When you don't eat a
certain amount of food,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:84%
we know that the body
responds to that as a threat

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.868 align:middle line:90%
to the system.

00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And when the body's under
a little bit of threat,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden the body
starts thinking, whoa,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting the food
that I was getting before.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.002 align:middle line:84%
So the body goes into cellular
recycling, cellular repair.

00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And we know when that
happens, the mitochondria

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:90%
make more energy.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:90%
The cells live longer.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, all the repair
vehicles, stem cells activate.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Genes turn on that
wouldn't turn on otherwise

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
because you kickstarted them
by telling the body, hey,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.832 align:middle line:90%
you're not getting food today.

00:06:25.832 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You better figure out a
way to get your energy.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And the body does that.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Given the number of
different theories on the topic,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the next step for researchers is
to conduct further studies with

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
human participants.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
While it may be some time
before there is consensus

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
on the exact mechanism behind
intermittent fasting's effect,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
it is clear that how
much and when we eat

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
may be just as important
as what we eat.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:10%
For a new perspective,
this is Gaia News.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.400 align:middle line:90%
