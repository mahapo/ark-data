00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Quebec, in
Montreal, with actually

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.260 align:middle line:90%
a very famous neuroscientist.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.547 align:middle line:84%
It's quite something because
we never met in person

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and yet I know very
much of your work.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.296 align:middle line:90%
We've done Skype interviews.

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:32.604 align:middle line:84%
And here we are here
in your own home.

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for accepting

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to do this interview
for GaiamTV.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.196 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIO BEAUREGARD:
Thanks to you.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm very excited
to have this conversation

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.361 align:middle line:90%
because I read your book.

00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
very, very important

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to have this conversation
and kind of anchor

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
these yet unexplicable
by traditional science

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon that are happening,
and people experiencing,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
such as near death
experiences and even hypnosis

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that you actually talk
about in your book.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And what else?

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy and remote
viewing and all that.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So I really, really
appreciate that we're

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
having this conversation.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
groundbreaking because there's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things
happening for you.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about your history.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I know now you belong
to the university.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:90%
You've done a lot of research.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're part of the
University of Arizona.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of
the Spiritual Brain,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and Brain Wars is going to
be our main focus today.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So tell us how did this--
where are you at right now?

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And what is your focus?

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you're
coming together,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:90%
a whole group of you in the US.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Plus you belong now
to this university

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and not anymore to the
University of Montreal.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So what is really
going on right now?

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:10%
I was having problems at
the University of Montreal

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle line:10%
because some of the
phenomena I was investigating

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:10%
that was creating a problem,
ideological problem.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Because the people,
my colleagues,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:10%
some of my colleagues
were reductive materialist

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:10%
scientists.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:10%
Because it's still quite
mainstream in universities.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:10%
So they didn't like the
kind of research I was doing

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:10%
and the kind of
books I was writing,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle line:10%
my ideas, and so
on and so forth.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:10%
So I thought that perhaps it
would be better somewhere else.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:10%
And I received an offer
from Gary Schwartz

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Arizona
who himself studies--

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:10%
he did studies about mediumship.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:10%
And he's very open-minded,
and it's a great place

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:10%
because they have a
center of consciousness

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:10%
studies over there.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.071 align:middle line:10%
So I'm affiliated with
them since a year now.

00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And I know
you got together

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
with other scientists
such as Larry Dossey

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that I had a beautiful
time meeting.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:90%
He's absolutely wonderful.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:90%
What is going on there?

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, I have
co-organized a meeting

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Arizona with Gary Schwartz

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and also another
researcher, Lisa Miller.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.890 align:middle line:90%
She's at Columbia University.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
She's studying the
relationship between psychology

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual experiences,
and spirituality, as well.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:90%
So we co-organized a meeting.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:10%
And in this meeting, many
famous scientists attended,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:10%
and they were all scientists
who do not believe anymore

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:10%
in the old materialist
worldview in science.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:10%
And people like
Rupert Sheldrake,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:10%
for instance, or Larry
Dossey, Pim van Lommel,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:10%
and so on and so forth, and
a great group of people.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:10%
And we have decided to create
a new scientific organization

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:10%
which we call post materialist.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, because materialism
has been the dominant view--

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
or the dominant paradigm
in science for nearly four

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:90%
centuries now.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But it started to be challenged
100 years ago by quantum

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But in the other
scientific disciplines,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
like medicine, for instance, or
biomedical research, biology,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
neuroscience, the
materialist view

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
is still quite influential.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But this wasn't
always the case, right?

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we look back in
history and the origins

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
before really things
became material,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
it was not before that, was it?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Or how did it progress?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.657 align:middle line:84%
Because a little by little, it
went more and more materialist.

00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
saying in the book.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Actually, at
the beginning of science,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
the fathers of what we
call modern science, 400

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
years ago-- all of these people
were deeply spiritual and also

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:90%
religious.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
People like Isaac Newton
or Rene Descartes,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or
even Galileo Galilei.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But after a few hundred
years following them,

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:90%
there was a big change.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Scientists became to
believe only in the matter.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the fathers
of modern science,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Descartes and so
on and so forth,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
proposed a number
of basic postulates

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
about the nature
of reality and how

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.240 align:middle line:90%
we can investigate these things.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the principals
they proposed

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.245 align:middle line:84%
was that everything in the
universe is composed of matter.

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
But these pioneers
knew that there

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:90%
was something else than matter.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
they all believed

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that what we call
matter was created

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
by a sort of
intelligent designer

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
at the origin of
everything in the universe.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.125 align:middle line:84%
But this was forgotten after
a few centuries of science.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
During the 19th century, for
instance, scientists only

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.890 align:middle line:84%
kept these basic assumptions
about the universe.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
But they started to think
that perhaps it was not

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
necessary to refer to
an intelligent source

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:84%
at the origin of
everything in the universe.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So they started to believe that
matter itself could explain

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
everything, including
us, human beings.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But during the 20th
century, and also

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
the 21st century,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:84%
we have collected so many data
in various fields of science

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that we know for sure now
that this old materialist

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
worldview is totally
wrong, completely wrong.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Spinning
together right now

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and bridging that is
very, very important.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:90%
What various fields such as--

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
you have physics.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.060 align:middle line:84%
You have biology, biomedical
research, neuroscience,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:84%
psychiatry, and
psychology, as well.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So now you have scientists in
these various fields believing

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that it's time to get
rid of the old paradigm

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and to switch to
something totally new,

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.252 align:middle line:90%
that we called post materialist.

00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:15.419 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm very interested
to get into, of course,

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.543 align:middle line:84%
the conversation of--
because your book, in French,

00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
is called The Power
of Consciousness.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Here it's called
Brain Wars" Could

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you tell us first why
there's a difference

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:90%
in the title over there?

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
because Brain Wars--

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
it was chosen by the editor
of the book at HarperCollins.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
In the book, I'm
referring to this conflict

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
between the materialists who
are still dominant in science,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
but also to the
other scientists,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
the non-material scientists,
who are investigating phenomena

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
showing that the old materialist
worldview is flat wrong.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:90%
So there's a big conflict there.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Hence, the title Brain Wars.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:84%
In French, it was
called the [FRENCH]

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
because-- so the powers
of consciousness and mind

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
because this is one
line of evidence showing

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that the materialist
view is erroneous.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I love when you get
into the whole-- well, first

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:90%
the placebo.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
it and start there.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:90%
The placebo-nocebo effect.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And how even, I didn't
realize, but it also

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:31.466 align:middle line:84%
has an effect even on physical
surgeries and problems.

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about that because
we don't talk enough about it,

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect is based on
the belief and the expectations

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
about a treatment
that is fake, sham.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have any real effect
biologically or medically.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Still, it as an effect
on the body just because

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:90%
of your belief about it.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And it plays a role in all sorts
of medical and psychological

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
interventions,
including surgery.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.525 align:middle line:90%
So for instance--

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So a
person that thought

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
they had a surgery, for
example, at the knees,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
have the surgery.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
They just-- somebody put
something on top of it.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean a plaster.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: And scrape
the skin, for instance,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
and made a small incision.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
That was study
that has been done

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
in the '90s at Baylor
College in Houston

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:90%
by Bruce Moseley, a surgeon.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And most of these people
were not even able

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
to-- they were walking with
canes before the intervention.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And after the
intervention, most of them

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
were even able to play
sports, including basketball,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
even though they
received the placebo

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:90%
surgery, the fake surgery.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So it shows that our minds
can be extremely powerful.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
very interesting study

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.510 align:middle line:90%
about a placebo.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It was done with
people suffering

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:90%
from Parkinson's disease.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And in Parkinson's disease,
you have destruction

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
of the neurons in the brain
producing a chemical messenger

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:90%
that we call dopamine.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the case
of those patients,

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
the level of destruction
was about 75-80%

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:90%
so it was quite severe.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And so these people
were very handicapped

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:90%
from a motor point of view.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:90%
They had trouble moving.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.243 align:middle line:84%
They were experiencing a
lot of tremors and rigidity

00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The doctors told these patients
that they had found something

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
new, a miracle cure for,
possibly, for Parkinson's.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And so those patients
who most believe in it,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
they started to
produce, in their brain,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:84%
dopamine in amounts
comparable to what

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
you see in very young
people, people 20 years old,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.430 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And so there was also
clinical improvement

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.547 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their ability to
move, less tremor and rigidity

00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so
forth for a while,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't last forever.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.702 align:middle line:90%
Still, this is quite impressive.

00:11:05.702 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So the body is able
to produce all those chemicals

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.221 align:middle line:90%
by itself?

00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.114 align:middle line:90%
But you have to influence it.

00:11:12.114 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You-- We play a-- You have to
give your body the exact orders

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:90%
to create such an effect.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yet it seems quite
spontaneous and those patients

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything about
traditional science, I guess,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:90%
or the dosage.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.058 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: No.

00:11:31.058 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in the case
of the placebo,

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
it's an unconscious process.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not conscious.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to believe
and expect good things

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
about the treatment,
and it will happen.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that it's part
of every sort of treatments.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see a medical
doctor, a shaman, healer--

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
it's active in all
sorts of traditions

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and for all kinds of treatments,
psychological and physical

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So I guess
the relationship

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
between the doctor or the
healer and the patient

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.874 align:middle line:84%
There should be a resonance or
some kind of alignment there.

00:12:13.874 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise
it doesn't work.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So now there are studies
showing that to generate

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
a much stronger placebo
effect, the relationship

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:90%
with the therapist is crucial.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't have a
good rapport with the therapist,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
then the placebo effect
will be much smaller.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how does this
consciousness actually

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:90%
interact with us?

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Or how can we
align with it so we

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
can have the benefits
and the effect of being

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:84%
part of something larger,
bigger, and really even

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
[FRENCH], self-healing,
and things like that?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that a state of mind?

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that a way of seeing things?

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:90%
You talked about belief earlier.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it part of the brain?

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there a particular
portion of the brain

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:90%
that will activate that?

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
it's several things.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's beliefs,
positive expectations,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:84%
a positive relationship
with the therapist.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also a matter
of perception:

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:84%
how you see yourself and your
beliefs about your disease

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and your body and your
capacity, as well.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mix of
several factors.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can influence
that to a certain extent.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you're confident
about the outcome,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
if you have a good relationship,
like we were saying,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
with the therapist, then
likelihood to get very strong,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:90%
positive results is much higher.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.354 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us about
the neurofeedback or--

00:14:02.354 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD:
Neurofeedback-- well, it's

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:84%
a technique where you learn
to control your own brain's

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:90%
electrical activity.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And you do that on purpose.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have the
intention of doing this.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you have electrodes
recording your brain

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:90%
electrical activity.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And the electrical
activity, recorded

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:84%
at the level of the
electrodes, it's

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
translated through a video game.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It's converted under the
form of a video game.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're in the
right zone-- for instance,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
if you take the case of a
child suffering from attention

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:90%
deficit disorder, for instance.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
They can have too
much slow waves

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
in the most anterior
portion of the brain,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:90%
what we call the frontal cortex.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So the training
seeks to increase,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
to speed up, the brain
waves in such a case.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, if the child,
when he's able to do that,

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
the video game-- it can be
racing cars or anything else--

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:90%
it moves forward.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:90%
There's animation.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And each time the child
gets out of the zone,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
the target zone,
everything stops.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So and there's no music anymore
and no cartoons and everything

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:90%
freezes.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
child can learn.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
He's receiving a feedback
about his own brain

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
electrical activity.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And for most people, you can
start controlling your brain

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
activity after 15-20 minutes,
usually, to a certain extent.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you repeat, in terms
of the number of sessions

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of training, after, for
instance, 30 sessions,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:84%
you are much better
at doing this.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:84%
In the case of children
with attention deficit

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and hyperactivity, they don't
need medications anymore

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
after, sometimes, 35-40 sessions
of neurofeedback training.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.250 align:middle line:90%
So this is very impressive.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've done studies in my lab
showing that when you do that,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
you change the functioning
of the brain regions involved

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
in, for instance,
attention, concentration,

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But now we know also
that you can even

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
alter the structure
of the brain.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.994 align:middle line:84%
So you can increase the density
of white matter, gray matter.

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Tell us about that.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask you more about
the white matter in the brain.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:90%
What role does it play?

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.034 align:middle line:84%
And could it actually
really increase?

00:16:46.034 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: So
the white matter,

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
it's nerve fibers connecting
neurons in various regions,

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:84%
different regions, two
regions, for instance, A and B.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you increase the
density of white matter,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
in principle, you will--
you can increase also

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
the speed of transmission of
the information between the two

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:90%
regions.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So the brain becomes more
efficient, if you will,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
information processing.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can also increase
the gray matter composed

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
of the nerve cells
themselves, the neurons,

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.470 align:middle line:90%
the density of neurons.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that the
brain is extremely plastic.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We use the term
neural plasticity.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And even the adult
brain is quite plastic.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.837 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts all life
long, across the lifespan.

00:17:43.837 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Even neurons, actually?

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Because we heard a lot
that we kill them if

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.250 align:middle line:90%
we drink or do this or do that.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And across our lifetime?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:90%
How does that work for you?

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, that's right
that we kill them, depending

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
on what you ingest, what
you eat, what you drink.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol, for instance,
is very toxic.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if
you try to learn things,

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:84%
if you read books, if
you watch even movies,

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
or you can even play video
games-- you will create

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
new neurons in your
brain and especially

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in certain portions of the brain
related to learning and memory,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:90%
like the hippocampus.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.510 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And since there's a lot of
plasticity in our brains,

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.882 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to slow
down aging in that way.

00:18:35.882 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Some people
go all the way

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:90%
to talking about immortality.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Where are you at in that matter?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
scientifically, it's

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:50.919 align:middle line:84%
not been demonstrated yet, but
we know it may be possible.

00:18:50.919 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: You get into hypnosis.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was quite excited.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.713 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm going to do
another interview with Rachal

00:18:55.713 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
here-- and what's his last
name, Chaboux-- on hypnosis.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was quite surprised
to see it in the book.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:90%
What's your angle on it?

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I think it's
quite misunderstood.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So people think that
when you do hypnosis

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're the subject,
you give your control

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
away to the hypnotist.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But the people,
the psychologists

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
doing study, scientific
studies, about hypnosis,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
now they know that hypnosis
is always self-hypnosis.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
So it means that if you don't
want to become hypnotized,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.210 align:middle line:84%
if you don't listen to
the suggestions made

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.755 align:middle line:84%
by the hypnotherapist,
it won't work.

00:19:36.755 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Nobody will be able to-- So you
have-- You're bringing yourself

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state
of consciousness

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.296 align:middle line:84%
when you do that, if
you play the game.

00:19:50.296 --> 00:19:51.587 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: What does it work for?

00:19:51.587 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:90%
What is it good for?

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: All sorts of--
well, clinical purposes,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
for instance, so phobia,
it can be very good.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Even depressive symptoms
and so on and so forth.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It can also have a physical
impact on the body.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done about the
speed of healing of fractures.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was done at
Harvard years ago.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And they have found that
if the patients were doing

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
self-hypnosis a few
times every week

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:84%
for four weeks,
for instance, they

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
were increasing the speed
of healing considerably

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
by a very important percentage.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So you can influence, it seems,
every process in the body

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and in the brain
using this technique.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: When we slow down,
is it because we slow down

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and we reach other
levels, deeper levels.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
about that, there's not

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of studies regarding
the brain waves associated

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:90%
with hypnosis.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:84%
But what we know, so
far, is that there's

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
a slowing down of brain waves
so you see a lot of slow waves

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:90%
like theta waves, for instance.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So when there are
more theta waves,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
it seems that it's associated
with a sort of expansion

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
the sense of self.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And in that kind
of state, it seems

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
easier to be able to work
out psychological problems

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:90%
or even physical symptoms.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You speak, too,
about the consciousness,

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.440 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic consciousness even.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's how you
say it in English, as well,

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:84%
but in your French book--
is that, describe us that--

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:90%
what is that term, cosmic--

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
in that state,

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the little self
vanishes totally and you

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
become united with everything
that exists in the cosmos

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and even with the
intelligent source

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
at the origin of everything.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of
experience has been

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:13.424 align:middle line:84%
reported across history
in various traditions.

00:22:13.424 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And this
is a place where

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:90%
spontaneous healing happens?

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what happens
in this state?

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Because often we
speak about unity.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean for you
from a scientific perspective?

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, it means
that we're not really confined

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:90%
to our brains and our bodies.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We are much more than-- we
are basically interconnected.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is very important
because, in those states,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you realize that you're
united with everything that

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
exists at all sorts of levels,
including what we call matter,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.800 align:middle line:84%
trees, and so on and so
forth, animals, other humans.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But also it can be also other
spiritual entities and so on

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.300 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, up to what seems
to be the source of everything

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is this why some
people do meditation?

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I know you're big
on meditations.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And you've tested.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Tell us some of the things that
you found in the meditation.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.187 align:middle line:84%
And do they-- Are people
really-- Do monks try to get

00:23:18.187 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:90%
to this level?

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.702 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we call
enlightenment for some?

00:23:20.702 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, yes, yes.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's called enlightenment
in certain traditions.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest with you,
many people try meditation

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
but they will never
get to that point.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
very interesting

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
because some people have
these experiences-- they reach

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
these states but they never
did anything to get there.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It seems to happen
spontaneously.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
there may be other factors

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know much
about those factors.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But, no, the studies we've
done about meditation,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
it was more to measure the
impact on the emotional portion

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the emotional
brain, that we call.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's also called
the limbic system.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what we measured is
that after only a few months

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of practice of what
we call mindfulness--

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a key technique in Buddhist
meditation, mindfulness.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The regions of
the brain that are

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:84%
involved in emotional
responsiveness,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:90%
they quiet down a lot.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the brain is not
as reactive as before.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can produce
such an effect

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
after only a few
months of practice.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's neural
plasticity, which

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.887 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about earlier.

00:24:45.887 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.272 align:middle line:84%
And there's activation of
some portions of the brain.

00:24:49.272 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in this book
that you speak of it.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And you even got to research
on Carmelites or something.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And they're praying so
it's not just meditation.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a certain openness.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:90%
How would you call that?

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes, well, it
was-- with the Carmelite nuns,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
they were talking
more of a state

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.550 align:middle line:90%
of prayer and contemplation.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.975 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: The
attitude and-- grace.

00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes,
because they believe

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that, if you have a very
intense mystical experience,

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
in their tradition,
they will believe

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's because
of God's grace.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So they don't believe that--
contrary to the Eastern

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
traditions-- they don't believe
that you can do or practice

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
certain things-- for instance,
prayer and contemplation--

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and that will
dramatically get there.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it depends
on God's will.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a totally
different approach

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.022 align:middle line:90%
than the Eastern traditions.

00:25:46.022 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But could that explain
how and why some people just

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
receive, all of a sudden,
something, some information

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
or all of a sudden they
see unity everywhere.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Or they have those mystical
experience, I mean, how-- Yeah.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Or being open to that
or having a relationship

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:90%
even a god experience.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being already, what
is the context because there

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:84%
must be some fertile
grounds for it.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yeah, but we
don't know much about this.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
For sure, in order
to experience this,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
you need a major
change, in terms

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in your brain,

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
electrically and chemically,
because, otherwise, it's

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:90%
not possible.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You focus mostly on what's
happening outside your body

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and also inside your body.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:90%
But that's about it.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:84%
You need a shift, in terms
of the brain activity.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And this shift can bring
you to these type of states.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But they believe that--
so, we believe now

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that the brain acts as
a filter normally, which

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
means that it prevents
you from reaching

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.330 align:middle line:90%
those high spiritual states.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So we focus mostly on
our biological needs

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
and primary psychological
needs and so on and so forth,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and what we call
the external world.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you do
something that allows

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
you to shift your electrical and
chemical activity in the brain,

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:84%
even for a few
minutes, for instance,

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:84%
if you take
psychedelic substance,

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:30.830 align:middle line:84%
then you disactivate the
filter function of the brain.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have
access to these things,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.856 align:middle line:90%
these other realms of reality.

00:27:36.856 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: More and
more people are

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:90%
very open to speaking of this.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really happens
often in interviews.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of Graham
Hancock and David Icke

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and all these really
state loudly and clearly

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.483 align:middle line:84%
that they have done, and that
they have or Ramdas, of course.

00:27:52.483 --> 00:27:53.441 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes, yes.

00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But it can happen also
with sensory deprivation.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You can be in a sensory
tank, for instance.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, like I was saying,
spontaneously apparently.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So we know perhaps it comes
from directly, in those cases,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.290 align:middle line:84%
there was an
intervention directly

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
from what people call
the spiritual world.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, but the
brain, how does the brain

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
evolve through all
those different,

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
through the meditation,
through being open,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
through being in the gratitude,
through being spiritual--

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:84%
like developing a
spiritual brain.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.560 align:middle line:84%
How does it, what
does it look like?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:90%
And is it permanent?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you spoke of neural
plasticity but was there some

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
kind of studies that show how
our brains are really evolving

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
from where they were before to
where they're now to long-term

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and-- mystical side, people--

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: No, there's
never been such a study.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
They are only have
been brain imaging

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
studies of different spiritual
states or meditative states.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's you take a snapshot of
what's happening in the brain

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:90%
during a few minutes only.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But no, this kind of project
has never been done so far.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:07.610 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know how--

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But the activity
would move, right?

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: I
think, well, based

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:90%
on what we've done so far, yes.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
The activity in many regions
of the brain seems to change.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So it would probably change
for a long period of time.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would allow you to
be able to synchronize,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to catch other
frequencies, if you will.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So the brain becomes like a
transducer or a transponder

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of other ranges of,
well, frequencies

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.406 align:middle line:84%
or aspects of
reality, if you will.

00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:51.155 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: The creator
of the consciousness.

00:29:51.155 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.125 align:middle line:84%
What does the light, the
role of the light itself,

00:29:59.125 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the light carries
information, doesn't it?

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
you looked at, or?

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: No,
but we know that it's

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
related to the-- light
is related directly

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.420 align:middle line:84%
to the activity of the pineal
gland, which is located

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:90%
at the very center of the brain.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And according to
spiritual tradition,

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:84%
various spiritual
traditions, it's

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
a very important center
for spiritual states

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But there's not any
study yet regarding

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:90%
this specific question.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And to tap in this
power and this consciousness,

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.370 align:middle line:84%
so we are playing a major
role in that, right?

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, otherwise, it's
really the person experiencing

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.750 align:middle line:84%
what they say in
quantum physics.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.260 align:middle line:84%
It depends really on the
person observing and living it

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that will make the
whole difference.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So how do you go,
and I'm sure you

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
had many debates
about this, but how

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:84%
do you go to make
a skeptic see it?

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Where's the transition?

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Where does the
transition takes place?

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, in
the case of skeptics,

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:90%
it's very difficult.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:90%
But there are exceptions.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a very famous
skeptical philosopher

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:84%
in England a few
years ago, A. J. Ayer,

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and he's had a
near-death experience.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was affected considerably
after this experience.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
cases, as well.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But the experience has to
be a very, very intense.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
In those cases,
however, these people

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.300 align:middle line:84%
were not looking after
something like that.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:90%
So it happened.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it happened for a
reason that was important,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.720 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their own
spiritual evolution.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:90%
But how do we know?

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But in other cases, in
the general population,

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
you can do things that will,
like I said, you have to alter,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
to switch, from your
normal brain activity,

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
electrically, chemically,
at various levels.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, you can
use all sorts of techniques.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.565 align:middle line:84%
Meditation will do that,
to a certain extent.

00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But you have to have a
minimum open to try meditation.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.106 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Exactly.

00:32:16.106 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have the
openness to do this, of course,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.820 align:middle line:90%
no, you won't get there.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.385 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:23.385 --> 00:32:27.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is there some
techniques or some things

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that are not yet
recognized or approved

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.650 align:middle line:84%
by traditional science that
show us-- that could be really

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
the next step in
proving that, I mean,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:90%
that would be kind of the door.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean even telepathy
or remote viewing

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.280 align:middle line:84%
or is there some that
are closer than others

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that could show them or us
that this is really possible?

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Certain drugs.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:90%
They are called entheogens.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And so drugs that lead you
to bring you closer to God,

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.940 align:middle line:84%
if you take the root of
this word or the deity

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
at the origin of everything,
the source of the universe.

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
So these substances
will alter or will

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
affect the filter
function of the brain.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it won't allow the
brain to operate as usual.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And because it shifts the
activity in your brain,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:84%
then you can access-- it's like
if you would have a TV set,

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.960 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and
you are-- normally,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:35.280 align:middle line:84%
we are always using
the same channels.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:84%
We're watching
the same channels.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have to-- and
these channels correspond

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to a certain frequency,
electromagnetically.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So we are receiving certain
electromagnetic waves.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you were able to switch
to other electromagnetic waves

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
or frequencies, in other words
to switch to other channels,

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you will have access to
other aspects of reality.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what these
substances will allow you to do.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about, for instance,
DMT and stuff like that, LSD,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:90%
mescaline.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
And now these
studies were stopped

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:84%
for political
reasons in the 1970s,

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.530 align:middle line:84%
in the United States first
and then in the entire world.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
But they have started again,
five, six, seven years ago.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And now there's an increasing
amount of those studies.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
One of them was done at a
famous university, John Hopkins

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.690 align:middle line:84%
in Baltimore, five,
six years ago.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that it
was possible to induce

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:49.580 align:middle line:84%
very intense mystical experience
in people who were not

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:84%
mystics at all but would
took this substance.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And this experience
created long-term effects.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.200 align:middle line:84%
So they were
followed across time.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
years still, they

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
were experiencing major
changes, positive changes

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: One person,
one experience,

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:84%
unity or this kind of
cosmic intelligence,

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
say, consciousness.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:90%
There's no return point.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Or at least there is
this seed, kind of,

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:84%
this light that is kind of
planted within the person.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
that happens then.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So NDE or something like
that would definitely

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.230 align:middle line:90%
change somebody's life.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.306 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes,
and so I've said

00:35:37.306 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:84%
studied NDE-ers, people,
experiencers who've had NDEs.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And we found that,
in their brains,

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
there were something
changed after,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.410 align:middle line:90%
in terms of electrical activity.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Something was different.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But how
can you measure it

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.506 align:middle line:84%
before because you don't know
when the NDE is going to be.

00:35:55.506 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Can you induce that too?

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: No,
but we just compare

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to the-- we have database
of the entire population,

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
the normal population.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we were able to.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But yes, that's a limitation
of the study where we're not

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.750 align:middle line:84%
able to scan them
before their NDEs.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
But still, we could
see things that

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
were completely different
than in the normal population.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that after
these experiences or-- it can

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.730 align:middle line:84%
be an NDE or you
can, perhaps, when

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:84%
you take mushrooms or
so on and so forth--

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.300 align:middle line:84%
something is changed
in your brain.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And this change will
allow you subsequently

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to have access to other
realms of reality.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Then how
one person knowing

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
that they can see
that and witness that

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and experience that through
that experience with drugs

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.280 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to redo it and
be then addicted to that drug

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:84%
or to go fully in the
experience and never

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:84%
really stop until
there is a tragedy?

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes, well, these
drugs, the so-called entheogens

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.960 align:middle line:90%
are not addictive at all.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.060 align:middle line:84%
They are very different than
the opiates, for instance,

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:84%
like morphine or cocaine,
heroine, or stuff like that.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So the people do not
develop addiction, at least

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
physiological addiction,
with these drugs.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But psychologically perhaps
it would be possible, however,

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.120 align:middle line:90%
to develop an addiction.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's not been reported
in the literature.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
that after you--

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.670 align:middle line:84%
even though you use a drug
to reach these states,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.720 align:middle line:84%
it may be easier after
that to be able by yourself

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.190 align:middle line:84%
to get back to this
place even without drugs.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.576 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know
much about this yet.

00:37:49.576 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And it seems to be
this always this mystery,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:84%
like we're trying to
understand everything.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But there is some questions
that don't seem answered even

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:84%
by the scientists
that are open-minded.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually a
good thing, isn't it?

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.071 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we have to-- we
try to understand everything

00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:07.780 align:middle line:84%
about everything when the
beauty of life might be actually

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:90%
this mystery.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:10%
>>BEAUREGARD:
Yeah, absolutely, I

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:10%
think it's deeply beyond what
science can do or can address.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:10%
There's still a
mystery and there

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.600 align:middle line:10%
are things we'll never
be able to solve,

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:10%
even using the most
advanced science.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: There is
beyond those wars,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.170 align:middle line:90%
there is this bigger picture.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yes.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:35.532 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
creates beauty in life.

00:38:35.532 --> 00:38:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is there
something else that you

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.948 align:middle line:84%
would like to mention
here because I know

00:38:38.948 --> 00:38:41.450 align:middle line:84%
there's many different areas
that you study and you give

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.435 align:middle line:84%
a lot of reference, which
is really appreciated.

00:38:45.435 --> 00:38:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: One
important thing

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.500 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that we're not
biological robots totally

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.110 align:middle line:84%
determined by our brains,
our neurochemical messengers,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:84%
our genes, and so
on an so forth.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So we can greatly influence
what is happening in our brains

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and all the physiological
systems connected

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.440 align:middle line:90%
through our brains.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's evidence
now that we can even

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
influences the expression
of genes-- what Lipton

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.450 align:middle line:90%
is talking about, epigenetics.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So we are able to
influence everything

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that is happening in our body
through our own consciousness.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
very important point

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our evolution
to become conscious

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.792 align:middle line:84%
of this, that we
have a great power.

00:39:34.792 --> 00:39:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Could we use the word
being conscious instead of

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:90%
being spiritual?

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Because this is really a matter
of being conscious of what's

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.720 align:middle line:84%
happening around us, being
conscious to the bigger

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well, yes,
because consciousness

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.400 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important features

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.560 align:middle line:84%
of what we call
spirituality, in my view.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.464 align:middle line:90%
So yes, yes absolutely.

00:39:56.464 --> 00:39:57.255 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Beautiful.

00:39:57.255 --> 00:39:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Well thank you so much.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a
lot to read here.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.686 align:middle line:84%
Brain Wars, and you wrote
many other ones, no?

00:40:02.686 --> 00:40:03.810 align:middle line:90%
There's not just those two.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Well,
academic books.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Papers.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.346 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: Yeah, yes,
yes, hundreds of them

00:40:07.346 --> 00:40:09.675 align:middle line:90%
but for specialists.

00:40:09.675 --> 00:40:12.414 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I will continue
to watch your work.

00:40:12.414 --> 00:40:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
traveling all the time

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and going to all those
different places.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BEAUREGARD: I
met the Dalai Lama

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.010 align:middle line:84%
to speak about
consciousness last summer

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.730 align:middle line:90%
in Melbourne, Australia.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.954 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I'm travelling
over the world.

00:40:24.954 --> 00:40:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I heard
he's very playful

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and playfulness seems
to be a big component

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.790 align:middle line:90%
of this whole game.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:30.831 align:middle line:90%
>>BEAUREGARD: Absolutely.

00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:32.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a good sign.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.349 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Beautiful.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much, Mario Beauregard.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:41.216 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, beautiful

I hope you have enjoyed it.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.345 align:middle line:90%
Please comment under the video.

00:40:44.345 --> 00:40:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I will look forward to this
conversation, you know.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's get it-- let's get
it bubbling because it's

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.030 align:middle line:90%
important in a co-creative way.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.050 align:middle line:84%
