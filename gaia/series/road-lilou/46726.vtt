00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.670 align:middle line:84%
This is Lilou here
on the road in Miami,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:84%
but this time
Miami is not sunny.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Because yesterday
I did a great video

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
with Ocean Drive
and the full sun,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.210 align:middle line:84%
but now this is also part
of the weather, and it's OK.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We also have in life our hard
moments, and it's part of life,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.553 align:middle line:84%
>> GABRIELLE ORR: And it's
not even a hard moment.

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
It's rain, and
that's the reason why

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
it's so luscious and green here
and warm, so we're loving it.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: Thank you
for having me, Lilou.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.671 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Thank you for
accepting to do this interview.

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoy and I
know a lot of the people

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.950 align:middle line:84%
here watching the
videos at Gaiam

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
love this topic too,
the Akashic Records.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.045 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
different spin on it

00:00:58.045 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
or a different
point of view, and I

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
like to bring those those
thoughts in the conversation

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and for us to know also, because
there is some things that-- we

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
hear so many things
about this topic.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
What is, for you,
the Akashic Records?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's just start there.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:90%
How do you view it?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:90%
What is your perception on it?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Mm hmm.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:10%
I like to bring a practical
approach to the Akashic Records

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:10%
and not to take the mystical
out but to take the unachievable

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
So it's our birthright to
communicate with the Akashic

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
Records.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see
the Akashic Records,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
it's a multi-dimensional field,
and it communicates with us.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:90%
It interacts with us.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people today still
interact with it in a way

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
that they receive
information in their dreams

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.860 align:middle line:84%
or through a spiritual
practice, in a sweat lodge,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
or they have what we
would call an epiphany

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and they receive
information from that.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to teach people,
or I'm teaching people,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
how to access the Akashic
Records on purpose,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.544 align:middle line:84%
meaning really creating a
communication with that energy

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And to do it, I use a prayer
to access the Akashic Records.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Pathway Prayer.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It will help us to align our
energy field to the energy

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
field of the Akashic Records
to make that connection

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.952 align:middle line:84%
and have an actual
communication.

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So it's like we're
getting in the different

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:84%
dimension, so our vibration
needs to go higher.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that why there's this prayer,
to kind of be welcomed also,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I guess?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.469 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Our vibration-- we
don't necessarily

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
have to go into a different
dimensional field,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
but our vibration will raise
up to the eighth chakra

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes higher where
we can make the connection.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I have a little
story to tell about that.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago-- and I was
already an Akashic Record

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
consultant, but I wasn't
teaching at that time--

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I had a time in my life
where I didn't feel so great.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I go in
the Records every day.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And at that period
of time, I didn't

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
go in the Akashic Records
maybe for two weeks.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And then finally I sat down
and I made the connection,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and right away, before I
could ask any questions,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
they said to me, you
don't have to do the work.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be willing
to communicate with us,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and we will meet
you where you are.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So no, we don't have to go into
a different dimensional field.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
We can stay human, because
that's our purpose right now,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.200 align:middle line:84%
to make our experiences
on this field

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and we live on this level.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But we can get to
a level where we

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
can have more access
to consciousness,

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and that is how I like to
use the Akashic Records.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: When you say
they, who are they?

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like
we're also part of it, no?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it universal
consciousness too?

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: No, that's
a good question.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
And when I say they, I refer
to the masters and teachers

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:90%
in the Akashic Records.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:84%
These are entities
and beings who

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
hold a very high vibrational
level of unconditional love

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them we would describe
as angels or archangels,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and some of them are even from
different planetary systems.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.555 align:middle line:84%
When I asked them, in
preparation for the book

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and for interviews, on how they
would like me to describe who's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
in the Akashic Records,
they showed me a movie,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and then at the end you
see the credits going down.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there are the
two or three top on the credits,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
the people you know.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's an actor,
producer, director.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But then all the others
you don't know by name,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and you just see, oh, they
are involved in the camera

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:90%
equipment or audio equipment.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying
it's exactly like that.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of lots of
entities in the Akashic

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Records, and what
we need to remember

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
is the energy and
the purpose they

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
have rather than specific names.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But as humans, we like
to categorize and label

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand
with our intellect,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and they work with
us on that level.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, I personally,
when I go in the Records,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't communicate with
one specific entity.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I can feel many entities,
but they speak as one to me.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to clients or
even when I teach classes,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:90%
entities do come through.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.980 align:middle line:84%
There's Jesus coming
through, Maria, Buddha,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
any religion, angels,
it doesn't matter.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them why do
you present the information

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
through this entity,
and they're saying

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.237 align:middle line:84%
because it's meaningful
to the other person.

00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: How is
that different, then,

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:90%
than channeling or intuition?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like you're
channeling some kind of voice.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: It is channeling.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not different
from channeling.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:90%
It is channeling.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Different from
intuition in that sense

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is that we get
psychic information

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:84%
when we access the
Akashic Records.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Even so, my main focus
is not on wowing people,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:84%
but the psychic information
does comes through.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And then intuition, you
usually get a gut feeling.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Is this right for me, yes or no?

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Should I follow
through with that?

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't get that
clarity of information.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I had a client
once, and she asked

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:84%
about a friend who
had passed away.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately-- she
wanted to know if he's fine.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And they immediately
showed me a man,

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and they described
him: tall, skinny.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And then they showed
me his hand and they

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
were five lines coming, like
Edward with the scissor-hands

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, like five lines
coming out of his fingers.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that this weird.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen that like this.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So I described it
to her, and I said

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:84%
it looks like he has
five lines in his hand,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:90%
and she says, oh, that's him.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and the other thing they
showed me was a walking stick.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said oh,
yeah, that's him.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:84%
He had five shih tzus, and
he would walk with them,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and he used to use
his stick to put them

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:90%
in lines if they would go crazy.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So for her, that was
a very meaningful

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
because she could
relate to that.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what it meant.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
But that is something that
comes through which you usually

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
don't get when you have
intuition, you know?

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Mm hmm.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose for
getting this information

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
is to help us on a
day-to-day or really liberate

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
maybe past memories
or past lives?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Or what is it?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Could we be stuck with
something, really?

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: Actually,
all of the above.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, the main
purpose is to help us--

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
I include myself in that-- to
be aligned with our soul purpose

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of that, we want

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
to let go of things that
don't serve us anymore,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
overcome blockages that
are holding us back,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that are confining
us, and getting

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.040 align:middle line:84%
into a different
level of energy that

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:84%
will move us from
survival to thriving.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And most people really
still live on survival.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
How do I pay the next
rent or the next mortgage?

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And even if they
don't have that,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
they are thinking ahead
on how they can always

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:90%
secure themselves.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have come here to
always live in fear and just

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
think about how we
can create security.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.404 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: No, but
it seems so real.

00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: It does.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But then how many
examples can you

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
give where people had
all of the security

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and then it didn't
work out at the end?

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So there is no real
security on the outside

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
unless it is supported
from the inside.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Ideally, where do you
think we can be as human beings

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
having this human experience?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
How could we be or what
is the optimum kind

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of stage or ideal where we
can fully live completely

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
our potential and
feeling free and happy?

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: One word
would be balance.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It has to be in balance.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we came here.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:84%
We are here because we want
to have a human experience,

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
so we cannot neglect that and
just focus on the spiritual

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
But the balance, it
has to be a balance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Find something in your
life that makes you thrive,

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that gives you excitement, that
is a purpose for you to get up

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
move ahead and evolve

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and change and create a
different mindset from you.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you're
in 10 years from now

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.650 align:middle line:84%
the same person you are today,
you kind of missed something.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You want to be part
of that evolution.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is the main
reason of why we are here

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and what we want to
contribute to this journey,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this
evolution on the inside

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:90%
as well as on the outside.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So create a balance
in your life.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't just focus only
on the one or the other.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Do they
speak of this oneness?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.707 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: They do.

00:11:23.707 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because we keep
on hearing it, you know?

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.924 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel-- and we have
right now big planes here.

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of noise
in big cities like that,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:90%
you know, planes, trains, rain.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just what it is, right?

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:90%
You probably can hear it.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And actually in a
few days, yeah, I'm

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:90%
flying back out to Europe.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
This reminds me that this is
very precious moment with you.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:90%
So how can we?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:90%
What was my question?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.646 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: Your question was
do they speak of oneness?

00:11:51.646 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: They do.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They speak of oneness in the
sense of-- in different ways.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Number one would
be they don't want

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:84%
us to feel disconnected or
alone or live in separation.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the separation doesn't
mean that you live alone

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
with 500 cats.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:84%
The separation can
also happen internally.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they want
us to understand

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of
a bigger picture,

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are part of the cosmic
community, but I also hear--

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: That we matter?

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: That we matter.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:90%
We are very important.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is perfect
that you say that.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
There is one part of the class
where they give a message

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and they say to the
students you are

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
so important to
this whole picture,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:90%
and that's why you are here.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be here
if we wouldn't matter.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We are so loved.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:90%
That's why we are here.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:90%
This is special.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
This is not a punishment.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a special
opportunity for us

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.760 align:middle line:84%
to experience life
in a different form.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we are one, but
we are also individuals.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have to, again,
create a balance

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:90%
between both of these things.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I hear them more
talking about if you

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
want to ask about the
collective consciousness

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and what they talk-- the
messages I'm receiving more

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is about letting go of all
of these rules we are having.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:84%
These rules that keep people
confined in their problems,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
in their limiting beliefs
and don't let them

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:90%
become who they really could be.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Like look at you.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You live a life that
is not the ordinary.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.225 align:middle line:84%
You live a life because you are
aligned with your soul purpose.

00:13:49.225 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't follow the rules of
society or family or anything

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.175 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:13:57.175 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: You enjoy
what you're doing,

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.955 align:middle line:84%
and it comes through in your
work, in your juiciness.

00:14:02.955 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no guidebook for-- I
feel that when we're living

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.632 align:middle line:90%
just our bliss--

00:14:08.632 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: You created
your own rule book.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
message I'm receiving

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:90%
more and more from them.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the rules.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
There is so much more out
there than you can comprehend.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make yourself
open to the possibility

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that what you are
living by right now

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
might not make sense in 10 years
from now or 5 years from now,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:90%
so be open.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And that means that openness
has to come from our heart too.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
oneness fits in again,

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to really embrace each
other and look at each other

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:84%
how we fit together and what
is our purpose here together,

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.602 align:middle line:84%
then trying to work it
out for yourself only.

00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there some other
lessons or some things that

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
come on a regular basis you
find in the sessions or while

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
teaching others that
are kind of recurrent?

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
They keep on coming back,
and it seems like some of us

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
are really incarnated back
here on Earth because there

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of big chunk,
or these type of lessons

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Mm hmm.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
At first, I would say no,
because the answers are

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
very individual, depending on
that person's soul purpose.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But then I would have
to answer with yes,

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:39.310 align:middle line:84%
because as we move through
the layers of things that

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
are going on with an
individual, the foundation

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:90%
is unconditional love.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So yes, every individual has
to work out their own causes

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and effects on why
they are where they are

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and where they would like to
be, but the foundation of that

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
is unconditional love.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And that message comes
through for everybody.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So learning how to
love ourselves and to just do

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:90%
things unconditionally?

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And even more, learning that you
are loved and what that means.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.293 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:16.293 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we are always
going to, as human beings,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to move in and
out of unconditional love,

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:90%
just like we inhale and exhale.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not meant to be on
one level all the time

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.460 align:middle line:90%
because we live from paradox.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:90%
We live from opposites.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But from their
perspective, they don't

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
have to live by our rules or
regulations or understanding.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
There is really just
acceptance, unconditional love.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything wrong.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:90%
You are here to evolve.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
You are here because
you are loved.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You are here because you
have something to give.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to forget that.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has something
to contribute.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
on what level it is.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: So I like
the word birthright,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:10%
because you're saying
in your books, you know,

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:10%
this is our birthright,
to tap in this knowledge,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:10%
to tap in these Akashic Records
so that we have the support we

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.700 align:middle line:10%
need.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:10%
It's part of kind of the tools,
huh, the tool box to help us?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our tool box.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Now birthright also means we
have a birthright to breathe.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's given.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't usually think about
it unless you have a condition.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So we inhale.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:90%
We exhale.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
They're saying it's
exactly like that.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.940 align:middle line:84%
We want to make sure
that you are always

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
coming from that
energy, that you always

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:90%
can draw back to that energy.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So from that perspective,
it's our birthright.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The way I want to--
would like to see people

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
using this is by accessing
their own Akashic Records

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and getting the
information they need,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
getting the energy
they need to create

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:84%
a shift in their perception
and in their life

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:84%
so they are aligned with
a different energy field.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Because usually most people come
from something they don't want.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Very few people come
from something they like

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and they want to increase.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And even fewer people
come from, oh, I'm happy.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Can you just play with me?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So most people who come to
me want to change something.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is your
birthright, too.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:90%
You are not here to suffer.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You didn't come
here to live in pain

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
or be depressed or overeat.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons for why you
do that, and you can change it.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And yes, your birthright
is to find that,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to not have to live 40, 60,
80 years in that energy field.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there a question
or something that we can ask

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to tap into
this quite easily,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
even though if we haven't
read the whole book?

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.098 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
some techniques,

00:19:20.098 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and you need to do
the specific prayer

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:84%
or have the knowledge to
really go in there yourself.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And you explain it in your book.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But is there something that we
can do, little practices here

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and there to have an idea of
what these Akashic Records are

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell us on
that specific day?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.571 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Mm hmm.

00:19:38.571 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Once you know how to
access the Akashic Records,

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
it takes not even a
minute to do that, OK?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So the way I have
my classes set up

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is that I want to prove to
people that they are actually

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:90%
accessing the Akashic Records.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So I have specific
exercises created

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:84%
they will answer or
work with before we

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:90%
go in the Akashic Records.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the book
is set up the same way.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, when
we go and I explain to them

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
how we access the
Akashic Records, how

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we say the prayer,
what process we use,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
we will do the same
exercises again.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel a
difference in that energy.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Number one, before they know
how to access the Akashic

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Records and the questions
I give them, they usually

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:90%
answer with questions.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So instead of actually
answering the question,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
they are answering
the question as

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
if they want to gain
more information,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and they use the
pronoun I. And also you

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.905 align:middle line:84%
can tell that they are using
the same quality of language

00:20:55.905 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:90%
as they use in their own life.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
When we are going in
the Akashic Records--

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and first we do a
few other exercises

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:84%
just to align the energy with
them and the Akashic Records--

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but when we get
to these exercises

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.385 align:middle line:84%
and we ask actually the same
questions, all of a sudden

00:21:15.385 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
they are receiving answers that
are answering the questions

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
they've written down
for the first exercise.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So that is always
mind-blowing to me.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't happen
just sometimes.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So if someone writes down "I
want to know my life purpose,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to know how I can show my
daughter more that I love her,"

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
afterwards when they are
in the Akashic Records,

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
they are getting the
answers for the questions

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
they wrote down before.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:90%
And also the pronoun changes.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:90%
It moves from I to you.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So someone is clearly
talking to you.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
physical sensations.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to say 85% of the
people feel an energy

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
field above their
head, and it feels

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:84%
like cotton candy pushing
down on your head.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It's light and heavy
at the same time.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:90%
So that is a physical sensation.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:18.520 align:middle line:84%
When I teach Skype classes,
the moment we open the prayer,

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the energy changes, and it
creates a static via Skype.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't happen sometimes.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It happens all the time.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is always
mind-blowing to me

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.036 align:middle line:84%
to see that these
things actually work.

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Especially
for a German mind.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you have this
dual citizenship,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:90%
so there is this rigor.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
At what moment were you
actually blown away by this

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, OK, this
is the way I'm going?

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: OK.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did grow up in Germany.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I lived there until I was 21.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And yes, for a German mindset,
that was, you would say,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:90%
unusual.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Even so, I have to say, I teach
a lot of classes in Germany,

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.884 align:middle line:90%
and they are super open to that.

00:23:03.884 --> 00:23:05.883 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's one of the
countries, I've heard,

00:23:05.883 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:90%
that's most open in Europe.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: I am so surprised,
the resonance that is in this

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:90%
country.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
They just soak everything
up like a dry sponge,

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
in Europe in general.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But I really-- I learned
the Akashic Records,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:84%
how to connect with
the Akashic Records,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
on purpose through that same
process as I'm teaching it now.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.616 align:middle line:84%
I refined it and I added
things so I can prove people

00:23:31.616 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
on how to access-- that they
accessing the Akashic Records,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.640 align:middle line:84%
but I use the same prayer as
the way when I learned it.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
But when I opened up my
records the first time,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
it took me back to an
experience I had as a child.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with-- I was born
with hips that were not aligned,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
so I had five surgeries until
the age of 18, hip surgeries,

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:90%
to align the hips.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I remember every time when
I would go under anesthesia

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.845 align:middle line:84%
and you lie on this
metal table and it's

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
cold and uncomfortable,
I felt so much love,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and I would see these
beings dressed in white.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
comforting me,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and they were standing behind
the surgeons showing me

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that everything would be fine.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to do with it.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So then fast forward
35 years later.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I accessed the Akashic
Records through this process,

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and the moment I
said the prayer,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I saw all of these beings
and I recognized them.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And all they said was
welcome home, my child.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I started to cry
because, at that moment,

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%
I never had to question it.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was real.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to
have any more proof.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But I understand that
our intellect constantly

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:90%
wants proof.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Even if we had 10
times proof already,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:90%
we still want more proof.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I designed it
that there is some proof to it.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to see that proof
and to see the reactions to it.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Mm hmm.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: You know?

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Gregg
Braden speaks of it.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of DVDs and
interviews with him on Gaiam TV

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So you were inspired, I guess,
by some of these researchers,

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:84%
if we can say, to
give scientific proof

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
or a researcher's
proof behind all this.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I always loved science.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's where my
German mind kicks in.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I always liked to
see that science

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
can prove that
this field exists.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.350 align:middle line:84%
They haven't really found
one common name for it yet.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it the A-field,
other the matrix, or just

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:90%
the field.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are wonderful books
written about it, actually,

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:84%
even by-- what's the author's
name who wrote "The Field?

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.769 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.769 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Lynne McTaggert, yeah,
that I've interviewed.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
She's on there.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.260 align:middle line:90%
There's many-- yeah.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:90%
That book is just mind-blowing.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is scientific
research on this field.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Like Gregg Braden,
for example, says

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that this field has existed
before the Big Bang.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
It is everywhere all of the
time, and it interacts with us.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It has intelligence.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what I want people

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to remember if they
are not into science.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Science can prove that
this field exists.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere all of the time.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It was here before existence,
and it has intelligence.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a library where
we go and get information.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
really cares about us

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and interacts with us.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not like Google.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.850 align:middle line:84%
When you give
something into Google,

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
let's say I would give in Lilou,
I get a lot of information

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
back, but it doesn't
interact with me.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say, oh, did you
mean Lilou Mace from France?

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.790 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interact
with me and give

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
me help to get to
where I need to be.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So that is the difference.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And this field wants
us to live in harmony

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.662 align:middle line:90%
with who we came here to be.

00:27:35.662 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What do you think
of past, present, future?

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it actually-- Do
you access past lives?

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the
Akashic Records are

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
really famous for past lives
or information from past lives,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:84%
mainly probably because
Edgar Cayce made

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.690 align:middle line:84%
it famous with
his readings even.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you study his work,
you recognize that even

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:84%
he was very much focused on the
now and how he can help people

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.855 align:middle line:84%
in that moment rather than
going too much into past lives.

00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I work with past lives
in the Akashic Records.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Even so, I understand
more and more

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
that there are no past lives
in the sense of timeline,

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that they're 500 years ago
and everything goes linear.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I come more and more
to the understanding

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:90%
that it all happens now.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
experiences on other levels

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that we have made and that
have left an impression

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
on us or it disabled
us in some way

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that we need to learn to
overcome so we can move on

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.120 align:middle line:90%
with where we are today.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I remember a client
who came to me,

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and she had a passion
for harps, OK?

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.160 align:middle line:90%
She owned one.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And harps are expensive.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:90%
They're like $20,000 and up.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And she had a car just for
the purpose of her harp

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
so she could drive
the harp around.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And she practiced
every day, but she

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.090 align:middle line:84%
said I don't feel
a passion for it.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to have
the harp in my life.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I like the sound, I
like that I can play it,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.775 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have a passion for
it, and I'm not really good.

00:29:25.775 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Sounds like
I am stuck with a harp,

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
to do about it, huh?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Exactly.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:10%
So she in her reading,
they immediately

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:10%
showed her in a past life, what
we would describe as past life,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:10%
she's a little girl in a bed
in a dark room in a corner,

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.110 align:middle line:10%
and she's sick.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:90%
She has a contagious disease.

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And the mother's not allowed to
go to her and take care of her.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.110 align:middle line:84%
But the mother,
to show her love,

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
is sitting in the corner of
the room playing the harp.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So the little girl
knew the mom is there,

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and she associated the sound
of the harp and the harp

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:84%
with love, unconditional
love from her mother.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So for me, that is
just information,

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
have that experience.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But my client immediately
said, oh my god, that's it.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And just for her to
get that puzzle piece

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and put it into
her puzzle helped

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
her to let go of her
obsession and to be

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
able to deal with other
things in her life

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:84%
so she wouldn't have to
just be focused on the harp.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:90%
She still enjoys it.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.350 align:middle line:90%
She still has it.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a major
factor in her life anymore.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
she has substituted

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
the love she received
from her harp

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:84%
with other sources of
love she focuses on now.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's how past life
information does come through.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:02.455 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can use it and
implement it in our life today.

00:31:02.455 --> 00:31:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it might not
always be easy to know

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.325 align:middle line:84%
what to do with
this information.

00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:08.110 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK?

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:10.695 align:middle line:90%
Or there's immediately usually--

00:31:10.695 --> 00:31:11.516 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: The harp?

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: No, no, no.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.552 align:middle line:90%
Not the harp, in other examples.

00:31:14.552 --> 00:31:16.385 align:middle line:84%
Like we receive all of
a sudden information,

00:31:16.385 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's like what do
I do with this now?

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, in my present now,
I'm aware of it, and what now?

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: I want to say, 85% of
the time people really resonate

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:90%
with it, even so for me.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
If I get the
information, it doesn't

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:84%
click because it has
nothing to do with me.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But people, you can see they
have an emotional reaction

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:90%
to it, and they know it's true.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.736 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
know it's true

00:31:42.736 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is that it changes
something in their life.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:84%
They are able to let go
of something and move on.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.225 align:middle line:90%
That's when you know it's true.

00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't
focus too much on it.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.270 align:middle line:84%
If I access the Akashic
Records, my questions

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
are not formulated to
just go into past lives.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
If it happens, if it comes
up, I'll work with it,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:90%
but I don't focus on it.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I focus on what's going
on with your alignment

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
today, for myself
and for my clients.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But it is important for us to
remember that things affect us

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.330 align:middle line:90%
from a past lifetime.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there ways to
receive this information

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.830 align:middle line:84%
and then do something so we can
kind of slip in there another

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:84%
information to have a better
life right now without doing

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:90%
much?

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to also kind
of respond back immediately

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.409 align:middle line:84%
to the field so that
we have a different--

00:32:38.409 --> 00:32:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Absolutely.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.439 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: --like changing
part of this hard drive?

00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Absolutely.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's a
very important question.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.990 align:middle line:84%
When we work within
the Akashic Records

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and we work on letting go
of boundaries, of problems,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.180 align:middle line:84%
of blockages, that's
just one small part

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
of the whole process.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Once we let go of that, we have
to put something new in there.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:16.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to get our human
manifestation, our brain

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:84%
into a new direction,
and that information

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.900 align:middle line:90%
comes through from them, too.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They will give us information on
how to change our energy today

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:90%
so we can actually move on.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
One of my most
favorite examples would

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.823 align:middle line:90%
be the woman they sent shopping.

00:33:33.823 --> 00:33:37.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] This woman
was very wealthy,

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:84%
but she didn't spend
money on herself.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.170 align:middle line:90%
She helped other people.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
She supported the whole
family, nieces and nephews.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But herself, it
was very difficult

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:84%
for her to spend
money on herself.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And she lives in Miami.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So they asked her to go
three times shopping,

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and she had to go to
Bal Harbour, which

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is the most expensive
mall here in this area.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So the first time,
she was not allowed

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to take a credit
card or cash, just

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
like $10 for a cup
of coffee, but she

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.665 align:middle line:84%
had to go into all the
stores and touch everything.

00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So those were the
instructions you received?

00:34:15.915 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Yes.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: My god,
that's pretty precise.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Very precise.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
She had to go into the Gucci
store, the Louis Vuitton store,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
touch it, feel it, look at the
craftsmanship and everything.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I think they even told
her how long the break was

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.870 align:middle line:84%
in between the
shopping adventures,

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
but I don't remember
that exactly.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It was a few weeks.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
time she was allowed

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:84%
to take her credit
card and her cash,

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.520 align:middle line:84%
but she was not allowed
to purchase anything.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.070 align:middle line:90%
She was just window shopping.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And the third time she was
allowed to buy something,

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:90%
if she wished.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:84%
Now I told her the
information just

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:59.730 align:middle line:84%
like I'm telling it to you now,
and I didn't feel an emotion

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.790 align:middle line:84%
with it because it
wasn't my issue.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.910 align:middle line:84%
She called me after the
first time crying in the car,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I'm having a
panic attack just looking

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.160 align:middle line:84%
at these things knowing
that the third time

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I have to buy something.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was important for her
to move through that energy.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:84%
She knew she couldn't
buy anything.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:84%
She didn't have any
way to pay for it.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:90%
She didn't take it with her.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But just that idea put
her in a state of panic.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the second time she
went, she said I had a blast.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I actually didn't think
anymore it was ridiculous.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.850 align:middle line:84%
The prices were more
comfortable to me.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the third time,
she did buy something.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what she did with that
process was not only letting

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:84%
go of her own pattern
by taking action,

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.750 align:middle line:84%
but she actually went
through the whole process

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
so the next time she doesn't
have to do it anymore.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.293 align:middle line:90%
It just feels natural to her.

00:36:01.293 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And I love that story.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
That was really moving for her.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But for someone who
doesn't have that problem,

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:09.804 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't feel deep.

00:36:09.804 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because she knew
it was a problem for her.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.850 align:middle line:90%
That's why she came to see you.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: Well, she came to see
me because she had physical

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But the physical issues
were a manifestation

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:90%
of her over-giving.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
She had problems in her
ovaries, and she just

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
was over-giving constantly, and
her body was reacting to that.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So they told her
what it was that she

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.200 align:middle line:84%
needs to learn to
take care of herself,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and then they showed
her how to do that.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to tell you
you have to eat healthy,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
but there are so many
things to choose from.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
What is really healthy
for you to eat?

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're showing you
go through these steps.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they did with her.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And not only did she
go through the process

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of taking care of herself.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Also the issues with
her ovaries went away.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Nice side effect.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there some times
when the soul or, I guess,

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.700 align:middle line:84%
it's just not the time to
give any kind of information,

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.890 align:middle line:84%
like there's nothing
that goes through,

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.671 align:middle line:84%
or the person just doesn't hear
it or it's just not the right

00:37:25.671 --> 00:37:26.170 align:middle line:90%
time?

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We try sometimes to
force things, you know?

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: I want to
say yes and no.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There is usually, I want to say,
when people align themselves

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
with the energy, that they even
hear of it, that they watch

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:84%
this video, that
they pick up a book,

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:84%
they are already in alignment
with it, and it clicks.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes-- and I've had that
a few times, not very often,

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is when someone is under the
influence of recreational drugs

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:84%
or alcohol, it does
affect their energy field,

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and I don't get anything.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.569 align:middle line:90%
So I've had--

00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And that's a big
issue, especially in the US,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.026 align:middle line:90%
everywhere around the world.

00:38:09.026 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:84%
But the drugs are
even what doctors

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:18.640 align:middle line:84%
give, the pills to not get
angry or to be happier.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Well, yes.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel
more if it's by choice

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
rather than if it's
a prescription.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, it's
an intention behind it.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So I've had-- I have
only once had someone

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.420 align:middle line:84%
taking a class with me, and
the first day she did great.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's a two-day class.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The first day she did great,
and the second day she

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:90%
didn't get anything.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them,
what's going on?

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And they showed me beer bottles.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did you have
a little party last night?

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.840 align:middle line:84%
She denied it, but her
niece was in the class too,

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh,
come on, admit it.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And then she said, yeah, I did.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.730 align:middle line:90%
We had a happy hour.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:90%
And that was OK.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.470 align:middle line:84%
She came back another time when
her intentions were stronger,

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.796 align:middle line:84%
and there was no problem
for her to do it.

00:39:08.796 --> 00:39:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And she went through
all of the levels.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
someone can't do it.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It's more that are you really
ready for it right now?

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to do it?

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.055 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:20.055 --> 00:39:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And sometimes
there's this sabotage that we

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:90%
experience as human beings.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to, but we do
something to just prevent it.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:90%
What do they say?

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.150 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: It's about getting to
a different level of comfort.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
even in psychology,

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.420 align:middle line:84%
but I do get the information
really from them.

00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like people grew
up in an environment,

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:84%
and they set their comfort
level to that experience.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Now there is this
thriving within them

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that wants something else,
but their limitations

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.110 align:middle line:84%
are set on this is what's
comfortable for me.

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.790 align:middle line:90%
It even goes to money.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Why do people make every month
the same amount of money?

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
their comfort level.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Now consciously they won't say
this is where I'm comfortable.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I want more.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But they are setting
themself up for this limit.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It can be positive or negative,
depending on how much it is

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:90%
and what you want.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So they are showing
us that we are really

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:84%
connected to a universe
of infinite possibilities.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And we don't grow up with
that belief, usually.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:10%
So we are growing
up with a belief

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.360 align:middle line:10%
that we are limited, that
only specific choices are

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:10%
available to us.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.220 align:middle line:10%
And the sad thing is
we start to believe it,

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:10%
and it integrates in
our subconscious level,

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:10%
and then that's the boundaries
we always hit against.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you
probably described

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:84%
as we go two steps
forward, one step back.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, we will, whether
people are in the Akashic

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Records or not, people usually
overcome their limitations when

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.850 align:middle line:84%
they really get tired
of it, when they really

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.370 align:middle line:84%
say I can't deal
with it anymore,

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:90%
when they start to surrender.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the Akashic
Records, we can

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
ask, what is it that
I need to know today

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.710 align:middle line:90%
to go beyond this limitation?

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Show it to me.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Show me an image.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Where can I be in
a year from now,

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and what do I need to
do today to get there?

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that we learn
how to ask the right questions,

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.080 align:middle line:84%
because questions
carry an energy.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how
much energy we offer,

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:84%
that's how much energy
we also get back.

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there something
important to say within this

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:54.730 align:middle line:84%
conversation that you feel we
haven't said that would good

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:90%
to share right now?

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ORR: The message I'm
receiving more and more from

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:84%
them through readings for
individuals, in classes,

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:84%
but in general as well is--
and that fits, actually,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:84%
really well-- is we have to
let go of all these rules.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We are living by too many rules
that are not really rules.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:84%
There are made-up,
rules how we have

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to behave in our
relationships, rules

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
on how we have to deal
with our finances,

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.610 align:middle line:84%
rules on who we are going
to be when we are older,

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:35.320 align:middle line:84%
what kind of security
level do we need.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And these rules are
really limiting.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.390 align:middle line:90%
They are not freeing.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They are set to make us
free and give us options,

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
but they limit us in our
way on how we look at life.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they are asking
me to write the next book

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:84%
on spiritual intelligence
and on letting go of rules.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:59.980 align:middle line:10%
So that is the message
I'm getting more and more

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:10%
from them, learning to look
at life from the perspective

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.420 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual
intelligence, and that

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.192 align:middle line:10%
means we have to
let go of rules.

00:43:11.192 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.685 align:middle line:84%
Let the miracle
happen every day.

00:43:15.685 --> 00:43:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:90%
And live it.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Live in this miracle.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't just look for it.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Live it.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Be that miracle.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Look at you.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.370 align:middle line:84%
To me, I've just met you,
but I can immediately

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:84%
tell that you made your
own rules for your life.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's not by what to do but
that you have that energy that

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.620 align:middle line:84%
is in alignment with
your soul purpose.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.020 align:middle line:10%
This is what you breathe in.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.100 align:middle line:10%
You are not doing it.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:10%
You are it.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we need
to get to, that we are it.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:10%
Nobody needs any
tools or modalities.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:10%
We already are it.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:06.640 align:middle line:84%
We're just using these tools or
modalities or even this prayer

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.107 align:middle line:84%
as a stepping stone to get
more into the purpose of it.

00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Beautiful.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Gabrielle.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your
book, "Akashic Records,

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:90%
One True Love."

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:17.611 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:17.611 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Thank you.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Lilou.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.159 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And thank you to all
delicious co-creators watching

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:90%
this video.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:26.006 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
commenting, adding some--

00:44:26.006 --> 00:44:29.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole conversation
happening underneath.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And please, I would love to hear
your thoughts on all of this

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:90%
and what we just spoke of.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>> ORR: Thank you.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Big, big kisses.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:49.167 align:middle line:90%
