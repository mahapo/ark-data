00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:84%
 Hello, my beautiful
co-creators.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Today I'm in Windsor.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to figure
out where I am

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:90%
now because I travel so much.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And today I'm with you, Jazz.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for accepting
this invitation.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.165 align:middle line:10%
 It's a real honor.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:10%
A real pleasure.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
 So you have founded
something called

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.825 align:middle line:10%
the Energy Diamond Coaching.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But you were born in Pakistan,
interestingly enough.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
You have this whole
background in science,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and now you're-- we're going
to speak about consciousness

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and the different
levels of consciousness

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a little
bit of your background

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
and how you got to this place
to understand that there's

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
different levels
of consciousness

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and we can actually tap in that
and work with that and better

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
your life-- better our lives
because we've understood that?

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
 Yeah, I was originally
from a Muslim family.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of asked to
read the Koran and memorize it.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
nobody explained to me

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:90%
what I was reading.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So I was reading
all this Arabic,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't getting
any meaning from it.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So as I grew up, I
wanted to do things

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:90%
which had more meaning to them.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And I naturally veered
towards science.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Science has, you know,
here is this formula,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
here is this description, and
it's telling you the way things

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:90%
actually are in the world.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was very meaningful
for me, and as a consequence,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I went on and
became a scientist.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But an interesting thing
happened when I was doing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:90%
my degree in astrophysics.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I studied quantum
physics and I actually

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
was doing a lot
of quantum physics

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:90%
work as part of my degree.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I discovered something
really unusual,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
which is that in
quantum physics,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
many scientists are aware of
the key problem with it, which

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
is it appears that people's
thoughts and their feelings

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
can affect the physical
activity inside of a quantum

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%
physics experiment.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:90%
So your mind can affect matter.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Your mind can affect reality.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something people have

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
been battling with
trying to understand

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:90%
for the last century.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And they still haven't got to
grips with it, the possibility

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that your thoughts could
somehow create reality.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started to look into what
many quantum physicists were

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
exploring on how
can we understand

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the role of our thoughts
and feelings and perceptions

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
in creating reality.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
quantum physicists

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
would refer to Eastern
philosophies, things

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
like Buddhism and Indian
Vedic systems, for example,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:90%
and Taoism.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
models they had

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
of how the universe worked that
came from direct perception

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
on their medications and so
on, it seemed, bizarrely,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
even though these people had
never been near a particle

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
accelerator or a
microscope, they

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have a remarkable grip
on what was going on at quantum

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
levels in the universe.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.735 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them got
curious about Buddhism

00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and about Vedic
philosophy and Taoism.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And naturally, I
got interested too.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, if that's where
you get to understand what's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
going on here, then
maybe I need to go over

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:90%
there and have a look at it.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of the masters,
these yoga masters and tai

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
chi masters, qi gong masters,
they work with energy directly.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:90%
They call it different names.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In the Indian systems,
they call that prana.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
In the Chinese system,
they call it chi.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Japanese system,
they call it ki.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But effectively, it's life
force of some kind or other.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And somehow consciousness,
our thoughts and feelings,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
seems to be in a kind of
collaboration with it.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So the people who are
the masters in the East,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
they work with
that collaboration.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They use meditation
to manage their energy

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and their vitality,
especially in things like yoga

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and tai chi and qi gong.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hm,
I'm a physicist,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:84%
but I-- if I could
use my own body

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.575 align:middle line:84%
as an instrument to do
some experimentation, that

00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
would be really great.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So I actually went
and studied qi gong

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
and I trained in it to
professional levels,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.465 align:middle line:90%
and also in Chinese medicine.

00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I started treating
patients and even

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:90%
training other instructors.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see
another side to energy.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
There is a physics
side to energy, which

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
is all about the way
that energy is perceived

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
by particle physicists and
people like Einstein and people

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But then there's this
other side to energy

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
which is very different to the
way people look at in the West.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's closely tied
to consciousness.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's like reality, the world
that we live in, in the East,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:84%
they look at it and say,
well, the reality that you're

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
experiencing is entirely
dependent on what state of mind

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:90%
you're actually in.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
That means that each of us
could be living completely

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
different realities based on the
kind of consciousness we're in.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Though some of us are
asleep, literally,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
or at that level
of consciousness.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of us look like we're
awake from a distance,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
but when you come up close,
you realize they're not--

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
that person isn't awake at all.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of
sleepwalking, you know?

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there are people
who are the highest

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:84%
They are what we might
consider to be called awake.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And within that there's
different awakening--

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Different degrees.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But what I found fascinating
was how many people came up

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
to me when I first started
discussing this and saying,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, that's
a nice philosophy.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But how do we work
with this practically?

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
How do we move from being
asleep to perhaps being awake?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And how do we know which
of those things we are at,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, in our lives?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
What parts of our lives are
asleep, which bits are awake,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.544 align:middle line:84%
and what parts are we
sleepwalking through?

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that is
the way to look at it.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't look at a person
say that person is awake

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
or that person's asleep or
that person is sleepwalking.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.797 align:middle line:84%
We're actually a
mixture of those things.

00:06:13.797 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Our lives are a mixture
of those things.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Some parts of our
lives are very awake.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Other parts we're
totally asleep in.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are some where
we think we're awake,

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
but actually we're sleepwalking
our way through life.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And if an incident or something
happens, boom, all of a sudden

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
we go back into the
non-awakening state.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get some people
who actually have woken up,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
but they don't like it.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It's uncomfortable for
them to deal with reality

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:90%
as it really is.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:90%
You know what they do?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
They actually
choose intentionally

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
to go back to sleep.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:90%
They go back to sleep.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference between
people who've woken up and gone

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
back to sleep and people
who've never woken up

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
and are still asleep.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because often we
say you can't go back.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.547 align:middle line:84%
When you-- once you're asleep,
you awaken, you're awake

00:07:00.547 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's impossible to live
the life you used to live.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, anybody who's
seen the film "Matrix"

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
will recognize a
character in there

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
who didn't like
the world the way

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
it was and he kind
of betrayed all

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
the other people in the movie.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And he decided he just wanted to
be reimplanted back in reality

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
as a rich person, and
he wanted to forget

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
how reality really was.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
He didn't like it.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
He just wanted to-- he
preferred the illusion.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.390 align:middle line:90%
The big steak.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
He wanted his meat.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
He liked his steak and he
wanted to be reasonably rich.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't care if
it was an illusion.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
To him, it felt better
than the reality.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So you do get people who-- they
just don't have the capacity

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to deal with the truth.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the capacity.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to go to a place

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
where you are going
to get woken up

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to
wake yourself up,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
you've got to go in with a
caveat, a kind of warning,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
which is, you've got to have the
capacity to deal with the truth

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to see, that
you're going to experience.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have the
capacity to deal with it,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
into a state of shock.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go into
such a level of pain

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that you feel permanently
disabled for the rest

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
But don't you think that if we
are facing that type of truth,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
then everything being
perfectly in order,

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
there is actually the right
moment for us to experience it,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
even how bad it can be?

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Like from-- in your own
personal experience,

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's a
good time to share

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:90%
with us what you went through.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I discovered
something when, a few years

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.947 align:middle line:90%
ago, I end up homeless.

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There were obviously
some truths in my life

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't facing up to,
otherwise I wouldn't

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:90%
have ended up homeless.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered something
which I kind of expanded

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:90%
upon a scene I saw in a movie.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I love movies.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
They're full of little
clues with regards

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
to what you've really
got on in your life.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
That's good, because
you know, Gaiam TV

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
has so many movies on
there, and people just like

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:90%
go from one movie to the next.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.325 align:middle line:84%
So you're speaking to the
right-- don't we love movie?

00:09:01.325 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, we love
spiritual connected movie.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, well there's an unusual
movie which is with Clive Owen.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And he played in movie
called "The International."

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:84%
In "The International"
he plays a CIA agent

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:84%
who finds that there are
these very naughty bankers who

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:90%
are processing funds for arms.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And Clive Owen is determined
to expose these bankers

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:90%
for what they're doing.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And he kidnaps the head
of one of the banks

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and takes him to his base
and he starts to tell him

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to tell
the world the truth

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:90%
about what they've been up to.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.525 align:middle line:90%
But the banker is pretty smart.

00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And the banker says, look,
before you tell people

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the real truth, you have
to tell them the truth

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that they want to hear.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
have to tell them the truth

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%
that they want to believe.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And only after
that are they even

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.985 align:middle line:84%
going to begin to think about
entertaining the real truth.

00:09:54.985 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
that, you know.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought, he's right.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I can go to any person
typically in the street,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and if I just give
them the real truth,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, they probably
wouldn't be able to handle it,

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:90%
So I thought--

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
They would think
you were crazy.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they'd think I'm crazy.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, where
am I coming from?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And, you know,
that's not the way

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:90%
the world is, kind of thing.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about
it, I thought, hm.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So eventually I came
up with a realization

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
that before you
can connect people

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to the real truth
about themselves

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and really connect them
into what they really

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:84%
need to be woken
up to, they need

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to go to kind of gradual stages
of getting there, to the truth.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And the first stage is
you have to work with what

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:90%
people are willing to hear.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying to tell
them that the earth is round

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what
they're ready to hear,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
as far they're concerned,
they look around

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and everything's flat,
all right, they're not

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:90%
going to believe you, you know?

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you've got to do

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
is, you've got to
communicate with people

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
in their own language,
in the perspectives

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that they're used to and that
are within their experience.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So you talk to them
only the truths

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that they're already
familiar with,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:90%
that they are prepared to hear.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And once they know that you are
someone who understands truths

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:84%
the way they do, they'll
probably trust you enough

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:84%
for you to ask them to consider
other things, things that might

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.970 align:middle line:90%
even challenge their beliefs.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the next
level of truth.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Once you tell people
what they want to hear,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.250 align:middle line:84%
then they're
probably going to be

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
ready to be told things which
might shift their beliefs.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
The truth that they're
prepared to believe in

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
is about to be shifted.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a stage where you
get to where people do start

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
to change their beliefs,
but you must have told them

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
already what they're
prepared to here

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%
before you even get to there.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are a couple of
stages which follow that.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you've told someone
what they want to hear

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and you've told them what
they need to in order for them

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to begin to shift
their beliefs--

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's nowhere
near the beginning,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
because they still haven't
changed what they're doing.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:84%
They still haven't changed
the way they're acting.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So then, once you've
worked with them--

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They start to
question at that stage.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the beliefs.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
If they're shifting
their beliefs,

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
they're probably
questioning what's going on,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're wondering whether
what they're doing or acting on

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:90%
is the right thing.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
That's usually when
they begin to start

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
working with the truth that
changes the way that they act.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's the truth
that they want to hear,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the truth they want to
believe, then there's the truth

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that they want to-- are prepared
to actually act on and change

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
their actions around.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, that's
got to be it, that's got

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:90%
to be end of it, right?

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But I realized, no, there's
another layer of truth

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, which is, you
can change the way people act,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean that you're
going to change who they are.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
People can pretend
to do stuff, but deep

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:84%
down inside of themselves,
they're still the same people.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
They've not changed
who they're being.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So beyond the truth which
shifts people's beliefs

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
is the truth that
shifts who they're

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:90%
being, who they actually are.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.334 align:middle line:84%
So there's all
these layers so far.

00:13:05.334 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell people
what they want to hear,

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.566 align:middle line:84%
you have to tell people
what they want to believe,

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
you tell people what they're
going to do in order for them

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to change the way the act,
and then, if you're lucky,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
you'll get to the place where
you finally get to change

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:90%
who they actually are.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this has surely
got to be the end of it, right?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.367 align:middle line:84%
This is the final
truth that you're

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:90%
going to be working with.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, no, of
course it isn't, because

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
beyond who we are and
what we think we are

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
and what we know
is everything else.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.294 align:middle line:84%
All the stuff that
we don't know.

00:13:33.294 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
What we don't
know, we don't know.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's a truth beyond
what we're prepared to be.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And that truth, if you'd
like, is the ultimate truth,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's beyond their ego.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond our awareness.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond what we
think of the world

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and our models of the world.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It's what exists independently,
whether we are living

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.140 align:middle line:90%
or whether we're dead.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out there's five
layers of truth, five levels

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
of truth you have to
work with people in order

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
for them to become fully
awake, if you like.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're asleep,
then you're probably

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.095 align:middle line:84%
just listening to things
that you're prepared to hear.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:10.950 align:middle line:84%
You're not even listen to
things that change your beliefs,

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:84%
let alone change the way
you act or who you're being.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
If you are sleepwalking,
then you're

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
prepared to at least entertain
some things that people say

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even change your
beliefs to some degree,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
but you're not going to
change the way you act.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
change who you are.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, if you
get to the point

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
where you are awake,
what you're hearing

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:84%
isn't what you're going
to base your truth on.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.640 align:middle line:84%
What you believe isn't going to
be what you base your truth on.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
How you act, how someone acts,
you're not going to judge

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:90%
a person by the way they act.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Even who you are, deep down in
terms of the authentic being,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
isn't something that you can
use to gauge how well someone's

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
connected to the real truth,
because people who are awake

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
know that there's even
a level beyond that.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
really awake, they

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:90%
can look beyond how people are.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:90%
They can look over time.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
They can look at the long
journey, if you like,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and they can see that there
might be an ultimate purpose

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
which can't be seen right now in
this present moment, that might

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
make this person
look bad right now,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
but in the long
sort of journey you

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
might see that they're
actually doing some good,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but nobody gets the
fact that they are.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So the people who are
awake have some very

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:90%
interesting kind of behaviors.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
share just two or three

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:84%
things about people who are
asleep, people who are awake,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and people are asleep--
how to spot them,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
how to spot which
of those you are

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and maybe which
parts of your life

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.305 align:middle line:84%
are asleep or awake
or sleepwalking.

00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
If you can come slightly
closer, because otherwise

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have this
mike little issue.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And also I would love to hear
how it is, this is related,

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
also I love this parallel
with your own life.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you went
through it big time.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So at what stage, because you--
I guess we hear it, hear it,

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:84%
hear it until we're
really down and suffering

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in this total turmoil to
eventually decide to change,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately it's not
as easy as just hearing it.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
No, part of my life is there
were parts-- there were times

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
in my life where I wasn't
prepared to even hear

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and things, let alone shift
my beliefs, the way I acted.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.060 align:middle line:90%
So I was below asleep.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I was totally in
a coma in my life.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And then certain truths hit
me, sometimes in painful ways,

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and you discover that if you
don't change what you believe,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
you're never really going to
act in an appropriate way which

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
serves you.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And many of my
relationships, the kind

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of works that I've done, and
the lessons I've learned,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
they're all about
what level of truth

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
do you have the capacity
to work with, you know?

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I discovered

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:04.190 align:middle line:84%
was that you need to know
which state you're in.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And you might find one part
of your life is asleep,

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
another part is
awake, and so on.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But you need to get at
least a map of your life

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
and which bits are awake
and which ones are not.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And you need a way of measuring
whether you're awake or not.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.721 align:middle line:84%
How do you know whether you're
awake or whether you're asleep?

00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:90%
Can we even measure it?

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.495 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, how do you
identify whether some part

00:17:24.495 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
of your life or a person that
you know is asleep or a wake.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.405 align:middle line:84%
And there are
symptoms, you know?

00:17:29.405 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
There are signs which tell
you that person's asleep

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:84%
or that part of
my life is asleep.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.675 align:middle line:84%
That person is awake or that
part of my life is awake.

00:17:39.675 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Things that we can
spot immediately,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:90%
like having conversation?

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, people
who are asleep--

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
have you ever tried to talk
to someone who's asleep?

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:90%
You can't, right?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Because they're in
their own little world.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't even probably know
that they're asleep, right?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And you won't get
a two way dialogue.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like you don't-- I
mean, sometimes I don't even

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
hear what they're saying.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
resonance, yeah.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they won't hear you.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
It might go in, but you
don't get a response

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
from them of the kind
that's linked to what you

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:90%
were actually talking about.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You've probably had
conversations with people

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking
with them, but they

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
seem to be having a
completely different

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
conversation from you.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.690 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
seem to be tuned in

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:90%
or present to where you're at.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's often a symptom,
that someone who's asleep

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
will often be having their
own little dialogue going on

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're not really present
to where you're coming from

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
trying to communicate.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about
people who are asleep

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
is often-- you probably heard
stories like this from maybe

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.720 align:middle line:84%
your friends, or I know
there've been occasions

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%
where I've even done it myself.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's asleep, let's
imagine there's a sleepwalker

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:90%
who walks all over them.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sleepwalker
doesn't even

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
know the person who's
asleep is underneath them,

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and they've walked
all over them.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what's
going to happen.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.560 align:middle line:84%
The person who's asleep, they
don't know that they're asleep,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and they certainly don't
know that there are people

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.455 align:middle line:84%
in the world like
sleepwalkers or people

00:19:05.455 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
who are awake,
because they don't

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
see anything beyond their
own little inner world.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:84%
So if they wake up one day and
they've been hurt and somewhere

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
in their life,
sleepwalkers walked

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:84%
over them and kicked
them and hurt them,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
they're going to wake up.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.103 align:middle line:84%
And because they don't know
about the existence of anybody

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:26.454 align:middle line:84%
else, the person who's asleep
is going to look at their pain,

00:19:26.454 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
they're going to look
at their suffering,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to go, well,
must be my fault. I caused it.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:90%
It's my own issue.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And they'll never
blame anybody else.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
No matter how hard
someone else hurts them,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
they will not
blame anybody else,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
or they will not
have the awareness

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
to know that that pain was
caused by somebody else.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't self-inflicted.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But they'll fool themselves
into thinking that they did it

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
themselves, that
they're unworthy,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
they're not that
together, they're clumsy,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
or they just don't know
how to handle themselves.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
So they'll blame themselves.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's another symptom of
seeing people who are asleep.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Other people hurt them,
but they blame themselves.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you are doing that, if
you're beating yourself up

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
over something which-- and
you're looking at the pain

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
you're experiencing
and you're wondering

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
how on earth you did
that to yourself, it

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
might be that you never did.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.845 align:middle line:84%
It might be somebody
else did, and you

00:20:19.845 --> 00:20:21.326 align:middle line:84%
were completely
blind to the fact

00:20:21.326 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:90%
that they were hurting you.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So these are the are the two
really key symptoms that you

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:90%
see of people who are asleep.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We can definitely
see how we can,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, here can apply
in relationships, and maybe

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:90%
not at work.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.394 align:middle line:84%
Or in relationships, but not
in communications or in--

00:20:40.394 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another feature
about people who are asleep.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll just finish with this
one for people who are asleep.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, imagine you're asleep, OK?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And the house is burning down
around you that you're in.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And a fireman bursts through
the doors of the house,

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.810 align:middle line:84%
comes into your bedroom
and violently picks you up

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
off the bed and wakes
you up in the process,

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and then begins to take
you down the stairs

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.720 align:middle line:90%
to a place of safety.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're asleep.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.435 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, violently,
you're woken up

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and some strange
person is manhandling

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
you and taking you
out while there's

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:90%
fire burning around you.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.621 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
go, oh, thank you?

00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You're probably going
to start screaming

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and start hitting them, thinking
that you're being kidnapped

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't until you're out in
the garden, where you're safe,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to look
back at your house

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and see it's all burning
down, that you realize

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:90%
this person just saved you.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So a symptom that you'll
often see is, people who come

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and rescue people who
are asleep and are

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.495 align:middle line:84%
in emergency situations,
the person who's asleep

00:21:45.495 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:90%
will always attack them.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:90%
They'll always beat them up.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll always hurt the
person who's rescuing them.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Do you know any
people like that?

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
People who are being helped in
an emergency situation and they

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.720 align:middle line:84%
don't even know that
they're being helped,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and they bite the
hand the feeds them?

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They literally fight
them and beat them up.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And often we reply,
I'm here to help you.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm not here against you.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Exactly.
Yeah.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably
the most stark

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
example of someone
who's demonstrating

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:90%
a symptom of being asleep.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
They're being rescued
by someone who

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
really wants to make
sure they're OK,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:90%
but they just don't see it.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
actually being hurt.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Typically what you see
is that they get taken

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:90%
out of a place of comfort.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
They were nice and
comfortable in their bed

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and they've been
taken out of it.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
When a person who's
asleep is taken out

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:84%
of a comfort zone in their life
for the sake of their safety

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and to actually ensure that they
are going to survive and not

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:84%
die in that comfort zone,
often that individual

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
will kick off and
start beating up

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
the person who's trying to take
them out that comfort zone.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
They do not like being taken
out of their comfort zone.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're used to.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Addicts are examples
of people are that.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
You try and take someone who's
an addict away from their drugs

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, the person who's
trying to help that individual

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
is clearly trying to get
them away from those drugs.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.505 align:middle line:84%
But the person who's got
the drugs and is an addict,

00:23:12.505 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:90%
he won't look at it that way.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
He'll think you're
taking away something

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:90%
that's vital for his survival.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And he will kick,
he will scream,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
they even do things like rob and
kill just so they can sustain

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.410 align:middle line:90%
being in that comfort zone.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:90%
They do that.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And that exists too
for soft addictions.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Some people are addicted to
shopping or internet or what

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
have you, and we-- it can
unleash the worst of ourselves

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
when we're confronted and
when somebody takes that away.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an
example of someone

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:90%
who's kind of half asleep.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Because they're kind of
sleepwalking, if you like.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing
about sleepwalkers.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Sleepwalkers, from a distance,
you can imagine seeing them

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.761 align:middle line:84%
in a room and they're
making themselves a cup

00:23:57.761 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:90%
of tea or whatever, all right?

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And you walk into the room
and you see them doing this.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:84%
If you see someone like
that in a room doing

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
that kind of thing,
you clearly would not

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:90%
think that they were asleep.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:84%
You would think, well,
that person must be awake.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They're making
themselves a cup of tea.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So you walk over to them
thinking that they're awake--

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Where is this going?

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And you try to have a
conversation with them

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%
and they won't respond to you.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They keep making their cup
of tea, wandering around,

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and they somehow, they
can't see your presence.

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:84%
They can't even see
that you're there.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite strange,
because from a distance,

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
they look like they're awake,
but then when you get up close

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to them and you try and have
a conversation or a dialogue

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or try make a connection,
it just doesn't happen.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And you probably are aware
of people, when you first

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.295 align:middle line:84%
met them, you thought, wow,
this person's really bright,

00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
they're really awake,
they're really tuned in.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you
get to know them,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you realize it was all a
pretty superficial thing

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and that deep down
within themselves, they

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.847 align:middle line:90%
aren't awake at all.

00:24:58.847 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
blind to what's

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
going on in their lives and
it's kind of a facade, almost.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And often they're the
kind of people, again,

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
there are symptoms to
spot people like that.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So one of the symptoms is often
they'll hurt people and not

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:90%
even know they're doing it.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
It's only when they wake
up and someone tells them,

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:84%
did you realize you were
hurting that person?

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And the person usually goes,
I had no idea I had no idea

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:90%
I was hurting that person.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:90%
And this is what you'll see.

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's
sleepwalking, for example,

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:84%
will very casually walk
over somebody who's asleep,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.230 align:middle line:90%
for example, and hurt them.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And while they're doing it,
because they're sleepwalking,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.694 align:middle line:84%
they won't even know that
that person was there.

00:25:39.694 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
know that they hurt

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:90%
them through their actions.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when they
wake up, truly wake up,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and someone who's awake
says, that person over there,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
do you realize you
walked all over them?

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:84%
That you took advantage of
them, that you hurt them?

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And the person who was
sleepwalking and is now awake

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.480 align:middle line:90%
will go, I had no idea.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I'd no idea I'd hurt them.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And if I was-- if I'd known,
I wouldn't have done that.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So often people who
are sleepwalkers only

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
discover that they've hurt
people when they've woken up

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.270 align:middle line:84%
because some dramatic event
has happened in their lives

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
or someone who's
genuinely awake and wise

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:84%
draws their attention
to something.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And they get to see that
they've hurt someone

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't even know
that they've been doing it.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So hurting other people without
knowing that you're doing it

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
is often a symptom of
someone who's sleepwalking.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of other
symptoms, and one of the ones

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:84%
is that someone
who's sleepwalking,

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.314 align:middle line:84%
like the person
who's asleep, there's

00:26:45.314 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:90%
an issue with eye contact.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's
sleepwalking, they will

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:90%
be living in their own world.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:84%
You can stare at them
straight in the face

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and they won't see you there,
and they'll carry on doing

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:90%
things that they were doing.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a direct
connection with this person,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
right, and you
think that you had

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
a direct connection
with that person,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:84%
but somehow it was
all an illusion.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:90%
They were never really there.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:90%
You can see in the eyes, no?

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.361 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you can
see it in the eyes.

00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
You thought--

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
A bit scary for an
awakened person to see that.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because you thought
from a distance that person

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
was awake, so you're
looking forward

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to going over, having
a conversation,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and doing things with them.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
there, you find you

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:90%
can't do anything with them.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They're on their
own little mission.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not even aware of your
presence, your true presence,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
where you're really from.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So sleepwalkers do
have these symptoms.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But the most amazing thing,
the most amazing thing

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:90%
is people who are awake.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:84%
People who are
awake-- imagine seeing

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:90%
someone who's awake in a room.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
If they see you across the
room-- one of the things

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that people typically will do is
they'll acknowledge you, right?

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll at least maintain
eye contact with you,

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and that's a kind
of acknowledgement.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They recognize that
you exist and they

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:90%
spotted you in the room, right?

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So maintaining eye contact
is one of the things

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that people who are
awake actually do.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not absolute thing,
but it's a thing that people

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.485 align:middle line:90%
who are awake actually do.

00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other thing
that someone who's awake

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:33.210 align:middle line:84%
actually does is someone who's
awake can see who's asleep

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and they can see
who's sleepwalking.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Once they get up close enough,
they can see that that person's

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.520 align:middle line:90%
sleepwalking.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that a
person who's awake can do

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:84%
is that they can make plans
with other people who are awake.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.980 align:middle line:84%
A person who's awake
can't make plans

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:90%
with someone who's asleep.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
They can sit there by the
bed and go through all

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
these options, and
the person is not

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to contribute
at all to making those plans.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And a sleepwalker isn't going
to be able to contribute

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to making your plans either.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The only person you make plans
with or some kind of goal

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that you want to commonly
achieve between--

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Big plans.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, big plans.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.690 align:middle line:90%
The people who are awake.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:84%
You can only make big
plans, in other words,

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:90%
with people who are awake.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's safer, too, probably.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you'll find is
that people who are awake,

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll end up in a two-way
conversation with you.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one-way conversation.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You talk to someone who's
asleep or a sleepwalker,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
you're the one who's
doing all the talking.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And the other person, they're
either not responding at all

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
going about doing

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:90%
stuff as if you're not there.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
A person who's awake
will listen to you

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and will feed back things
to you based on the things

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:90%
that you've been saying.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And maybe between
yourselves, you

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:84%
can come up with a plan to help
the sleepwalkers to stop them

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
from waling all
over the sleepers.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can do something which
ensures that the people who are

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.880 align:middle line:84%
asleep don't roll off
the edge of a cliff

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of their sleep.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So the people who are awake,
they can do all these things.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I love about
the people who are awake

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
is that if they're
strong enough, then

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
they can be there for the
sleepwalkers and the people who

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.130 align:middle line:90%
are asleep when they wake up.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine
you've been asleep

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're just beginning to
wake up and rubbing your eyes

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and stretching open, looking
at the world around you,

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, where
am I, kind of thing,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.010 align:middle line:84%
it's great to have someone
who's awake there by your side

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:90%
when you wake up.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they can tell you,
oh, by the way, those things

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:90%
down there, they're your legs.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need those
to get around this world.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
get rid of stuff

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need any more,
you want to dump garbage

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
from your past, baggage, there's
a spiritual toilet over there,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
That's where you go
and let go of stuff

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
that you don't need any more.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a kitchen
over there where

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:90%
you can go nurture yourself.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And those people over
there, don't disturb them.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
They are in a deep
state of meditation

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to awaken
to an even higher level.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Have you come across
people who, people have

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:84%
told you this
person's really awake,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.440 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of enlightened?

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Yet when you go and approach
them, they kind of reject you,

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.060 align:middle line:84%
they tell you, no, don't
talk to me, go away.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever come
across people like that?

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I've met a lot of
spiritual egos, yeah.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Some people that they
were, but talking to them,

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and actually then I decide not
to post those videos online,

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
feel right, yeah.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are certain
individuals who actually are

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:49.045 align:middle line:84%
very awake, but they're
trying to do a service for all

00:31:49.045 --> 00:31:50.670 align:middle line:90%
the people who are awake.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.687 align:middle line:90%
They're doing a higher service.

00:31:52.687 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people who are awake

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.240 align:middle line:84%
will tell you, don't
interfere with that person.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.150 align:middle line:84%
They're doing something
to enable us to even wake

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.050 align:middle line:90%
up to an even higher level.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that means they can't
afford to spend time doing

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:84%
trivial things like
just helping you gab it,

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, in terms
of wakefulness.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And compassionately,
those individuals,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
when you approach
them and you see

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.010 align:middle line:84%
what a great source
of light they are,

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:84%
compassionately, they
will indicate to you

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.705 align:middle line:84%
they're not
available to help you

00:32:23.705 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and you need to find
somebody else who's awake

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and who isn't committed to
such a task as they are.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've come across
people like that.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I've come across
people who everybody

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.310 align:middle line:84%
else said, oh, that's the
person you should go to.

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone there
and I found that they

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:84%
weren't as accommodating
as I thought they would be.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.635 align:middle line:84%
And in the end I realized, oh,
that person was someone who

00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
used to help
people, but his role

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.030 align:middle line:90%
has changed now in this world.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
He's now dealing with
higher duties, if you like.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Therefore he's not someone
I should be bothering,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.340 align:middle line:90%
you know, out of respect.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:84%
You should leave them alone
because they're dealing

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.555 align:middle line:90%
with a big-- bigger things.

00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:90%
But often we misplace that.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.775 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear so
often, I receive a lot

00:33:08.775 --> 00:33:10.960 align:middle line:90%
of feedbacks from the internet.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And often people say oh, this
person used to be available

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but is not any more, and
he's just a different person.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:90%
He has changed.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not anymore that
leader, that person

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:90%
that I used to know.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's immediately we
feel then the separation

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:90%
when it's not personal.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not personal.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just they've got
a bigger duty than us.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, you do get people
who are egotistical,

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
who used to help people.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But because they failed
to honor themselves

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:41.870 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
helping others,

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:84%
they ran themselves down and
they're not in a position,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.710 align:middle line:84%
energetically, to
have the capacity

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:90%
to help anybody else any more.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So when people come to
them because they've

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:84%
heard all these tales
about this person

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and then that
particular master just

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.884 align:middle line:84%
shoves them away and pushes them
away, people don't understand.

00:33:57.884 --> 00:33:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to
be a master, you're

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be a guru,
dut dah duh duh duh duh.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Yet you're rejecting me,
you're being horrible to me,

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:90%
dah duh dah duh dah.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
that person was never

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.790 align:middle line:90%
a master in the first place.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
They put themselves out
as someone who could help.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Other people, maybe, made
that person into a master,

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and it was a role
they never wanted.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.110 align:middle line:90%
They just had a gift.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They chose to share
it with people.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
Too many people
demanded it from them

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't-- he didn't
have enough left for himself.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence
he ran himself down,

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you know,
he isn't available for anybody

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:90%
any more.

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.555 align:middle line:84%
Now I had someone
who was a mas--

00:34:35.555 --> 00:34:37.589 align:middle line:90%
I worked for who was like that.

00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:40.620 align:middle line:84%
But there's also some people
that think they have it or they

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.129 align:middle line:90%
think they're-- and they don't.

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's also
disillusion within this realm.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
I met quite a lot of people like
that in Europe, not in the US,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
but in Europe,
interestingly enough.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So how to deal with
those situations

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:84%
when you really have to
listen also deeply inside

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:84%
for your own guidance
and not be lured

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
by what a seemingly
outside guru can give you?

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
These are very-- to me, these
are very, very important

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
questions right
now, because we are

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.426 align:middle line:84%
sometimes following the wrong
people, and this-- yeah.

00:35:18.426 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to
have your take on that,

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:84%
within-- it's a little
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.840 align:middle line:90%
within the conversation.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.330 align:middle line:84%
No, it's timely,
because when I first

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
started doing the work that
I was doing in helping people

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and coaching them,
I realized actually,

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I could spend a
lot of time helping

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
other people through
the things I'd mastered.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And I never called
myself a master.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:84%
I always said, as
Bruce Lee said,

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all
student masters.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.810 align:middle line:90%
We're all training in mastery.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And that also means
that anybody is capable,

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:84%
you know, of developing
mastery in their lives.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And my goal became that.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It became, how do
I help other people

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:90%
to become their own masters?

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Not to seek a master, but
to become their own master.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And each of us are on a
unique journey, each of us

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.980 align:middle line:84%
have got unique
challenges in our lives,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
unique path that we

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.370 align:middle line:84%
have to master in order for
us to fulfill our purpose

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and for our gifts to make
a difference in the world.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So our challenge
in life is really,

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:26.190 align:middle line:84%
how do we achieve mastery
over our own purpose

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and our own fulfillment
of that purpose.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- that is the
biggest challenge of all.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Rather than running around
chasing after other people

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:84%
who've only got half the
answer or part of the answer,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.210 align:middle line:84%
the only person who's got
all of the answer is you.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to get to a place
where you begin to have mastery

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.170 align:middle line:84%
over your own journey,
over your own path,

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and when you act as your own
advisor, and you get to a point

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:84%
where you don't borrow wisdom
any more from other people,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:84%
but you actually start to
get to generate your own,

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that's probably the
most critical task

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
you've got to do
in terms of being

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:90%
in a state your own mastery.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of you,
some of your viewers

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.060 align:middle line:84%
may have heard the phrase,
that if you give a man a fish,

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
he gets to eat for a day, if you
give a man the ability to fish,

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
he can feed himself
and his family

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his life.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.525 align:middle line:84%
And I took that
particular phrase

00:37:20.525 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and I changed it a
little bit for the sake

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of mastery and wisdom.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you give
a person a wisdom

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and he'll become
wise about one thing.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.440 align:middle line:84%
If you give a person the ability
to generate their own wisdom,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:84%
then they'll become
wise about everything.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.760 align:middle line:84%
However, if you give
a person the ability

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to help others generate wisdom,
then he can help everybody

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:90%
around himself become wise.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest talent of
all is actually giving a man

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
help others to help

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.860 align:middle line:90%
others generate their wisdom.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.660 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of one or
two steps removed.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you have the ability
to help others to generate

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
their own wisdom
between themselves,

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:11.610 align:middle line:84%
it means that the whole
world becomes wise.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So mastery really
isn't just about you.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It isn't even
about other people.

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:19.170 align:middle line:90%
It's about the wisdom itself.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
lessons themselves

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that
they're getting learned,

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's you
that's learning them,

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:84%
there's other people
that's learning them,

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.150 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're being
learned in order to make

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:90%
a difference to the world.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:90%
It's never about you.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's never about other people.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was learning
martial arts,

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I learned a really
important lesson.

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:84%
I used to tell the students
that I used to train

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.015 align:middle line:90%
in tai chi and qi gong.

00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, if you get
to be so much better than me

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.180 align:middle line:84%
that you actually get to
improve the discipline

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
itself in the process, then
you're exercising mastery.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you've
become a master,

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but at least you're exercising
the practice of mastery,

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:84%
because you improve
the discipline itself.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In the East, often a master is
classified as a master when not

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
they've mastered a particular
kick or a particular punch

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and they've reached so many
levels of belt or something

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:84%
like that.
No.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.690 align:middle line:84%
A master is typically
classified as a master

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:84%
when they've added something
new to the discipline.

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
A brand new kick, a
faster punch, or a new way

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of gathering energy or a new
meditation which everybody, all

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:90%
the other masters start to use.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So mastery is often
considered only

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to be mastery when you've done
something which has contributed

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
excellence beyond yourself
to the discipline itself,

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to the mastery that everybody
else can actually join in on.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.422 align:middle line:90%
So real mastery isn't about you.

00:39:45.422 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about the people.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It's about something
more eternal

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can
continue to learn from,

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.140 align:middle line:90%
even when you're not around.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the chi,
the force, the life force

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.850 align:middle line:84%
being able to express
itself through us.

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:03.709 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's really about?
-Yeah.

00:40:03.709 --> 00:40:09.390 align:middle line:84%
If you can add to the life
force so it changes its nature

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and it improves the vitality
and life and consciousness

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.870 align:middle line:84%
of all things, even
when you're not there,

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
then that's an
example of mastery.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.562 align:middle line:84%
I the East, one of the
ways to classify masters

00:40:23.562 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is, interestingly, through
ability to work with control

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and to work also
with collaboration.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like yin and
yang, male and female.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
A master is someone
who knows exactly

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:84%
when to take control and, if
you like, manipulate things.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:47.710 align:middle line:84%
He also knows exactly when
to let go and collaborate

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and go with the
flow with things.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And the best
masters are the ones

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.990 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily who do
one at a certain time,

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:90%
another at another time.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
They in a moment what
proportion of each they need.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They know they need a
certain amount of control

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and then a certain
amount of collaboration,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and when they get
that just right,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.530 align:middle line:84%
they end up in a
state of harmony.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of you may
have seen the tai

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:84%
chi symbol, which is dark
one side and light the other.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:84%
It's got a couple
of dots in there,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and there's this S-shaped kind
of dividing line between them.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But actually, that line
isn't a dividing line.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a harmony line.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the place where the
dark and the light, the male

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and the, female the
yin and the yang,

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.500 align:middle line:84%
are actually in proportion
with each other.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.640 align:middle line:84%
They're in harmony
with each other.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They often call that
the-- the whole symbol

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.810 align:middle line:90%
is called the tai chi itself.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:84%
That yin-yang symbol
is called the tai chi.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And that dividing line, like I
said, it's not a dividing line.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a harmony line, and they
call that the tai chi line.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you walk in life
along the tai chi line,

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it means everything's
proportion in your life.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.215 align:middle line:90%
Everything's in harmony.

00:41:57.215 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:84%
You're literally walking the
middle road, as they say,

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism.
So--

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:02.980 align:middle line:90%
The point zero.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:08.841 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that point is where
there is no-- it's equality,

00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's
not even equality.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.016 align:middle line:90%
It's a place where--

00:42:13.016 --> 00:42:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Harmony.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:17.390 align:middle line:90%
There is zero conflict.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
that zero point, it

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.130 align:middle line:90%
refers to a place of stillness.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a place where
there's possibility

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:90%
of things coming into creation.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.350 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that state
of harmony and you're

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
in a perfect proportion--
not equality.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:90%
No, it's proportion.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing could be
bigger than the other.

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a place of
proportion within yourself

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.936 align:middle line:84%
and you're in that
place of stillness

00:42:44.936 --> 00:42:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and your consciousness is placed
on that kind of zero point

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:84%
in your being, that's when
you connect to your source,

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.640 align:middle line:90%
deep down inside of yourself.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:84%
That's when, if you place
an intention into the world,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:84%
into yourself at that
point at that time,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.900 align:middle line:84%
because you're
connected to your source

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:06.490 align:middle line:84%
without any interference, that
intention will materialize.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It'll come out into the world.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So real mastery is
actually about that.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about being in a place
within yourself where you are

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:84%
exercising control and
collaboration in proportion

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.755 align:middle line:84%
with one another, and you are
also aligned to your source

00:43:24.755 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me just finish
with one point

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.070 align:middle line:84%
on this, which is the research
I found out recently that I've

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:84%
been doing, I just discovered
yesterday something

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
amazing and new amongst
the data for the people

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:84%
that we were actually
working with.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:44.260 align:middle line:84%
We discovered that when someone
is aligned to who they truly

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.590 align:middle line:84%
are deep down within themselves,
that means this person they're

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.900 align:middle line:84%
showing the world is the same
one as who they really are deep

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.300 align:middle line:90%
down inside, authentically.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:84%
When they get to that
kind of alignment,

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
synchronicities and
coincidences start to happen

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:90%
for that person in their life.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And we also realized, though,
that there was another thing

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that would generate
synchronicities

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and coincidences,
which was their ability

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to be completely
present and centered

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.590 align:middle line:90%
and still in the moment.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, when they weren't
being bothered by their past

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't being
distracted by their future

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to be
completely with their attention

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and intention in the
moment, in the here and now,

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.600 align:middle line:84%
if they could do that, it turned
out the more time they were

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.690 align:middle line:84%
able to be in that
kind of state,

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:36.980 align:middle line:84%
the more likelihood
they were going

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to get synchronicities and
coincidences in their lives.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing thing
was when people did both.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:84%
When a person was aligned to
who they truly were deep down

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.370 align:middle line:84%
inside of themselves and they
were able to do that here

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:53.500 align:middle line:84%
in the present and
hold that alignment,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that's when the
biggest synchronicities

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and coincidences and magic start
to happen in people's lives.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Va-va-voom.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So that, for me,
is real mastery.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.870 align:middle line:84%
If you can be aligned
to your true self

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and you can hold
that in the moment,

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in a state of pure presence,
in the here and now,

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.940 align:middle line:84%
you get kind of thing that
happens in physics, which

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:84%
is whenever energy gathers in
a particular area in space,

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.830 align:middle line:84%
physics says it acquires
a gravitational field,

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:24.460 align:middle line:90%
an attractive field.

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The more energy there is,
the more gravity there is.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So small planets don't have
as much pull as big planets

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:90%
or as stars do, for example.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the same thing
happens with you.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.290 align:middle line:84%
When all your energy
is here in the moment

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and it isn't spread out
thinly over time and space

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
in the past and future,
if all your energy's here,

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
have a very strong

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.760 align:middle line:84%
gravitational field around
you-- a strong attractive field

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, people who are
in the present literally

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.080 align:middle line:90%
have more presence.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You're more in the present,
you're going to have

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.120 align:middle line:90%
more presence, all right?

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And it shows, because
those people are often

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:84%
described as individuals
have a lot of weight

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.890 align:middle line:90%
to their character.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They literally have a lot of
gravitas to their character.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
they are people

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.400 align:middle line:84%
with incredible influence
in their environment.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.490 align:middle line:90%
And charisma.

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:84%
That's often how
it comes across.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.160 align:middle line:84%
If they were in alignment
with their true self

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and are being able to hold that
in that moment in the presence

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:84%
of themselves to the biggest
strength that they can,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.610 align:middle line:90%
that often radiates as charisma.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
People don't know what it is
they like about that person.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.851 align:middle line:84%
They just seem to be drawn
to them, gravitationally

00:46:42.851 --> 00:46:43.550 align:middle line:90%
attracted to them.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.910 align:middle line:84%
They literally
gravitate towards them.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:47.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So mastery really does come
down to just those two things.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about alignment
and it's about presence.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Anybody you ever met who
has a presence to them

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and is clearly aligned
in some kind of way

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to who they really are, to their
values, they demonstrate two

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:90%
really important qualities.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is
they seem to have

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:90%
a kind of grace about them.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything they do
seems effortless,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and it seems almost beautiful.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like a dance.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:90%
It's something that you watch.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that visually is beautiful,

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's kinesthetically
beautiful.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:84%
You feel it on the inside
that who this person is

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and the way they're
doing things,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.440 align:middle line:84%
there's something just
beautiful about them.

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
how these people

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%
physically might not be that
appealing to a lot of others.

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.030 align:middle line:84%
However, the connection
that they have,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:49.220 align:middle line:84%
the gravitas that they have,
whatever they're radiating

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.770 align:middle line:84%
is something that other
people feel the grace of,

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and they just feel compelled to
think that individual is being

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.940 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, even though
they physically might

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.940 align:middle line:90%
not be particularly attractive.

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are lots of saints
and gurus who are like that.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Physically they don't look
like much on the surface,

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:middle line:84%
but somehow in their
presence, you feel grace.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And grace, when you
sustain it for long enough,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.000 align:middle line:84%
people often regard someone
who's gracious, that's a kind

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.080 align:middle line:90%
of prerequisite for beauty.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.400 align:middle line:84%
If you can demonstrate
grace consistently

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and in a repeatable
way, people will

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.680 align:middle line:84%
often regard you as
a beautiful being--

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.350 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful human being.

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So mastery is also
to do with grace.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.340 align:middle line:90%
You can be aligned.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.260 align:middle line:84%
You can be in the
present moment.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:40.820 align:middle line:84%
However, if you do those two
things, being present and being

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.570 align:middle line:84%
aligned in a way
which is graceful,

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.220 align:middle line:84%
people will experience
your beauty.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And most masters,
they radiate that kind

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.390 align:middle line:90%
of grace, that kind of beauty.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then-- it's one of my
ambitions, if you like.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to get to a point where
I'm aligned and fully present

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing
everything with grace

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not tripping over myself
and getting in my own way.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to get to
that point, so it's--

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're certain
passionate, that's for sure.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm so enjoying
this conversation

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and I know that you are, too.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.720 align:middle line:84%
This has-- this has
been incredible.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So the two traits you said,
the last two traits, I've

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.470 align:middle line:84%
heard grace and beauty
is the second one,

00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:90%
are you-- is there-- OK.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you stay in alignment
and you're fully the present

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and you manage those two things
in a way which is graceful

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and you sustain that
graceful way of being,

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
eventually, over
time, you become

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.450 align:middle line:90%
someone who radiates beauty.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So the two are--
of course they are.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And it feels good, it
makes us feel good anyway.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.300 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, no
words are needed, and--

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.130 align:middle line:84%
People always get uplifted
by beauty, but especially

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.670 align:middle line:84%
beauty which is to do with
presence and to do with grace

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and to do with kind of character
which has integrity to it.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:09.070 align:middle line:84%
You always feel
uplifted when you're

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.560 align:middle line:90%
around someone like that.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And you always tend to
be pretty depressed when

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:84%
your around someone who's
constantly undermining

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:20.680 align:middle line:84%
themselves and clumsy and
just not there and their mind

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.720 align:middle line:84%
is distracted and
somewhere else.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, you feel
frustrated by someone

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.740 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
be around them.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.090 align:middle line:90%
You want to move away from them.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You're actually repulsed
from an individual like that

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.030 align:middle line:90%
rather than attracted, right?

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So it kind of
follows that someone

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:84%
who can be aligned and be
present and be graceful

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
is going to show a beauty
which isn't visual.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
It's something you feel
and something you know.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
it's easy to trust.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Dolphins, let me tell
you, dolphins have that.

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They do, don't they?

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Graceful-- they're graceful.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Look how they swim,
look how they leap,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and look how every movement
they have is perfectly aligned

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.850 align:middle line:90%
to what they're trying to do.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.950 align:middle line:90%
So they have that alignment.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.060 align:middle line:90%
They have that presence.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.040 align:middle line:90%
They can be totally there.

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
You put yourself in the
water, they're there for you.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.560 align:middle line:84%
They're all--
they're all over you

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.840 align:middle line:84%
with their energy and their
attention, aren't they?

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, they
can sustain that, too.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
problem in sustaining it.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's inevitable that human
beings would look at creatures

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:28.760 align:middle line:84%
like dolphins and can't help
but immediately experience them

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:90%
as a source of beauty.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they've got
all those qualities.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:84%
They're aligned, they're
sustaining their grace,

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:90%
they're totally present.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Of course they'd be beautiful.

00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's even beyond beauty.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:42.210 align:middle line:84%
It's that unlimited
potential, it's the love,

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:46.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the presence, it's the
all time-- it's no more time,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.070 align:middle line:90%
linear time, it's all of it.

00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's our spirit that experience
through those moments, I think.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Beauty is linked
to that, obviously.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is one step beyond
beauty, which is when you've

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.640 align:middle line:84%
been able to maintain
beauty and you've

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.990 align:middle line:84%
been able to do it in a way
which seems like it's going

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:05.190 align:middle line:84%
to last forever, then
it becomes precious

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to not just immediate
people, but it

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:11.200 align:middle line:90%
becomes universally precious.

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the point when people
usually consider that,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is, to be sacred.

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So beauty, when it's been
eternally established,

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is something that
people eventually

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:26.750 align:middle line:90%
regard as being sacred.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So masters, true masters who are
aligned and are present and are

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.880 align:middle line:84%
exercising grace and
are radiating beauty

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and have been doing
it for a long time,

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:39.600 align:middle line:84%
or even their teaching
or the learning around

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.360 align:middle line:84%
them has been around
for a long time,

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.410 align:middle line:84%
eventually that person,
or their teachings

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:50.000 align:middle line:84%
or their way of being, is
considered to be sacred.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a
reverence for them.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So resonance with that
individual over time

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.670 align:middle line:90%
becomes reverence.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Because now that
individual has moved on

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.140 align:middle line:84%
from simply being
human to actually

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:13.000 align:middle line:84%
being someone or an entity
or a way of-- a being

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.370 align:middle line:90%
which is actually sacred.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:20.370 align:middle line:84%
It's simply an evolution
from resonance to reverence.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And usually you find
the people who've

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.380 align:middle line:84%
got the greatest reverence
for those kind of people

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.070 align:middle line:90%
are the people themselves.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They have a deep send souls
revering their own gift.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not an
egotistical way.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.470 align:middle line:90%
It's something which they honor.

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:41.510 align:middle line:84%
They totally respect the
gift that they've been given,

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and they don't abuse it.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And they usually look at it
and work with it in a way

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.400 align:middle line:90%
where they treat it as sacred.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've come
across some people,

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.750 align:middle line:84%
teachers and the holders
of knowledge, if you like.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And there are some people who
work with their knowledge,

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.100 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
treat it as sacred.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand the
power it has to bring beauty

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.680 align:middle line:84%
into the world
and uplift people,

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.995 align:middle line:84%
and they treat it in a
very casual kind of way.

00:54:08.995 --> 00:54:11.095 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, they're
not anywhere nears

00:54:11.095 --> 00:54:16.970 align:middle line:84%
as inspiring as someone
who is totally working

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.530 align:middle line:84%
with their knowledge
and their teachings

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.380 align:middle line:84%
in a way where what they
consider that working with

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.440 align:middle line:90%
is sacred.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Don't disrespect it.
And you don't.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.720 align:middle line:84%
With someone like that, you do
not disrespect that knowledge.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You don't disrespect that
way of being because one

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of the consequences usually is
immediately, within yourself,

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.770 align:middle line:90%
you feel like hell.

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:39.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel, oh my god,
why'd I do that?

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe I did that.

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're totally
embarrassed and so on.

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:46.470 align:middle line:84%
But the masters, usually, they
tend to be quite nice to you,

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:90%
because they're compassionate.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a central feature
of being a master.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to
what I said earlier.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is really about
working with the truth in a way

00:54:58.350 --> 00:54:59.900 align:middle line:90%
which gives you more life.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think mastery, if it's not
something which is bringing you

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to the truth in a way
which gives you more life,

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.620 align:middle line:90%
it's probably not mastery.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something else,
but it's not mastery.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I think, the
reason why the Tibetans look

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.630 align:middle line:84%
at compassion as
being the greatest

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:20.420 align:middle line:90%
force there is in the universe.

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.922 align:middle line:84%
Often if you speak
to Tibetans and ask

00:55:21.922 --> 00:55:23.730 align:middle line:84%
them, what do you think
the most powerful force is

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, they
won't say the USA.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:28.069 align:middle line:84%
Right?
No.

00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:30.170 align:middle line:90%
What they'll say is, compassion.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Because compassion
can help people

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:84%
bring themselves to
the truth in a way

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.470 align:middle line:90%
where they become more alive.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And if there's more
life in the universe

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's more truth,
then surely we're

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.620 align:middle line:90%
heading in the right direction.

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much, Jazz.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
amazing conversation.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have
enjoyed it too.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:90%
We want more.

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.429 align:middle line:84%
I know, I know.
I want more.

00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring
you to the studio

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.710 align:middle line:90%
down in the Gaiam TV for more.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:58.010 align:middle line:90%
My goodness, this was great.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.910 align:middle line:90%
See you soon?

00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you, Lilou.

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real privilege
to have had your audience

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and for you to have invited all
of this awareness out of me.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you so much.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Much love, my
beautiful co-creators.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.400 align:middle line:90%
