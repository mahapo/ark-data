00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello delicious co-creators.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.682 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here in Santa
Cruz, and this time I'm

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.585 align:middle line:84%
with Foster Gamble's wife,
Kimberly Carter Gamble.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:18.919 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:19.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Kimberly Carter Gamble:
Hello there, Lilou [laughter].

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Another juicy video.

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.491 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready my
beautiful co-creators?

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.725 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.994 align:middle line:84%
I love being on the road
and meeting people like you.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:29.597 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the peace that
you're bringing to the world.

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:84%
You're known because you were
the -- but for many reason,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.903 align:middle line:84%
but obviously you've brought
out the movie, Thrive.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
You are the producer, the
director, the co-writer

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.145 align:middle line:84%
of this movie, and there's many,
many things to talk about here

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:45.379 align:middle line:90%
within this conversation.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.114 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people, as part

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:50.951 align:middle line:84%
of the gay community has
seen the movie, and --

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:53.821 align:middle line:84%
but I would like specifically to
do this video on the chemtrails.

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.924 align:middle line:84%
I know you're very passionate
about this topic and especially,

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.727 align:middle line:84%
the solution around
that because we're --

00:00:59.727 --> 00:01:04.431 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of us are aware of
the situation, but what are some

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.568 align:middle line:84%
of the solution to
these big huge trails

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:08.702 align:middle line:90%
that we see in the sky.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.873 align:middle line:84%
We feel totally powerless
in front of that.

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:16.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, I think
I'll start with you know,

00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:19.914 align:middle line:84%
how it came to my attention
and why I feel so confident

00:01:19.914 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
about being able to stop
chemtrails is you know,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:84%
unpacking the agenda as we
did in the movie Thrive,

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.724 align:middle line:84%
I really got to see how
it was in every sector.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:35.396 align:middle line:84%
It was the most organized agenda
really, in our environment,

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and in the media, and health,
and justice, and governance,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:84%
you know, any sector
that you looked into,

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.306 align:middle line:84%
it was coordinated
with another sector.

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.974 align:middle line:90%
And anything that happened,

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.909 align:middle line:84%
it seemed they could
easily take advantage of it

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.881 align:middle line:84%
to have things go the way that
they already had in mind to go.

00:01:53.881 --> 00:02:00.454 align:middle line:84%
And so it really made me realize
that as many brilliant people

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.424 align:middle line:84%
as there are working on
solutions all over the world,

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:06.627 align:middle line:84%
we aren't as organized
and coordinated as that,

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:10.397 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't been going at it
in a really whole systems way.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:16.904 align:middle line:84%
So my motivation was to figure
out really developing tools

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:20.407 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate being
as organized as that

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
which we're working to obsolete.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.814 align:middle line:84%
And so chemtrails is a
perfect example of a --

00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:29.216 align:middle line:90%
of one of any number of problems

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.951 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go
at in this way.

00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:34.722 align:middle line:84%
So what Foster and I did was
we created this solutions hub

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:90%
at thrivemovement.com.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.093 align:middle line:84%
I know he's talked some about
that, and the gist of it is

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:43.297 align:middle line:84%
that you know, it always
comes down to human beings.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:45.799 align:middle line:84%
I'm -- I was an activist
starting in the 60's

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.836 align:middle line:84%
in Berkeley, and in those days
you know, you get concerned

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.139 align:middle line:84%
about an issue and take
it on and think you had

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.443 align:middle line:84%
to do the whole thing and
burn out, and it doesn't work

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.546 align:middle line:84%
that way, and we have a
lot of work to do here.

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.849 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea with
the solutions hub is

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.418 align:middle line:90%
that you can identify what part

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:08.756 align:middle line:84%
of an issue actually most
concerns you, because like

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.958 align:middle line:90%
with chemtrails, you know --

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.560 align:middle line:84%
so chemtrails, just in
case anybody doesn't know,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.833 align:middle line:84%
there's a program that is
supposedly Solar Radiation

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.103 align:middle line:90%
Modification Management program,

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and what is does is
there's aluminum, strontium,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.743 align:middle line:84%
and barium are sprayed into the
atmosphere at high altitudes

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:34.782 align:middle line:84%
by planes and then those metals
fall to the ground, and they get

00:03:34.782 --> 00:03:38.852 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, and in our soil,
and our water, and our food.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.155 align:middle line:90%
So that's documented, you know.

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:44.525 align:middle line:84%
And in the United
States, I think there are

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:48.461 align:middle line:84%
over 32 states already
have legislation related

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:54.368 align:middle line:84%
to weather modification and the
agencies dealing with it are

00:03:54.368 --> 00:04:00.307 align:middle line:84%
like NOAA, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Admistration

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:04.812 align:middle line:84%
and the National Sciences
Foundation, the U.S. Air Force.

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:07.448 align:middle line:84%
There -- you know, it's
absolutely documented

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.216 align:middle line:90%
that there is a program

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:13.787 align:middle line:84%
that involves spraying heavy
metals into the atmosphere.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.223 align:middle line:90%
What seems to get controversial

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:20.227 align:middle line:84%
about the issue is
actually acknowledging it

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:25.999 align:middle line:84%
or questioning the legitimacy
or the safety or the morality

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.701 align:middle line:90%
or the legality of it.

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:29.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And clearly
we can see them.

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:31.305 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a plane.

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.107 align:middle line:90%
Really, it stays there.

00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:34.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Yes, that's
the difference.

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.343 align:middle line:84%
You know you can -- some
people have confused it

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:38.912 align:middle line:84%
with the normal jet
contrails that go over,

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:42.449 align:middle line:84%
but jet contrails dissipate
within a few minutes.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.085 align:middle line:90%
The chemtrails last for hours.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:49.356 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, in China, even
during the 2008 Olympics,

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
they were boasting about how
they used weather modification

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.563 align:middle line:84%
to make sure they had
a dry opening ceremony.

00:04:56.563 --> 00:05:00.701 align:middle line:84%
So you know, people acknowledge
that this is what's happening.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:04.037 align:middle line:90%
The question is, is it safe,

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:84%
and I personally believe
that it's not, and...

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:08.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And why is it done?

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, there are any
number of reasons, and it's kind

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
of the -- one of the things

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.384 align:middle line:84%
about a whole systems solutions
hub model that's interesting is

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:21.555 align:middle line:84%
that you don't actually have
to agree on why, because that's

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.956 align:middle line:90%
where we get into speculation.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:24.258 align:middle line:90%
You know, I know some people,

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:28.429 align:middle line:84%
they think it's a benevolent
weather modification thing

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:30.931 align:middle line:84%
like putting snow on
ski slopes, you know,

00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:34.535 align:middle line:84%
but that it's having
inadvertent health impacts.

00:05:34.535 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else thinks
that it's you know,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.145 align:middle line:84%
the 80% of the world's
economy is weather impacted,

00:05:45.145 --> 00:05:48.916 align:middle line:84%
so they think well, if you can
control the weather then you can

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:51.151 align:middle line:84%
predict it, which gives
you a real upper hand

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.054 align:middle line:84%
in commodities trading, so they
think it's a corporate agenda

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:55.422 align:middle line:90%
for that.

00:05:55.422 --> 00:06:00.627 align:middle line:84%
Others, this notion of solar
radiation management is the idea

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:04.631 align:middle line:84%
behind it and there are patents
for this you can look up,

00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:08.168 align:middle line:84%
that you put the heavy
metals into the sky

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:10.103 align:middle line:90%
and it reflects the sun back.

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it also creates
a blanket that traps

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.808 align:middle line:90%
in the heat at the same time.

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.911 align:middle line:84%
So maybe their concern is
that that was a good idea

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.781 align:middle line:84%
for climate change,
but it's having this

00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:22.349 align:middle line:90%
unexpected consequence.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.786 align:middle line:84%
So the point is,
whatever your concern,

00:06:25.786 --> 00:06:30.424 align:middle line:84%
and why you think they're
doing it, is really --

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:33.093 align:middle line:84%
it's only that your
concern that unites us,

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:37.464 align:middle line:84%
because then what happens is
you can say well, am I most kind

00:06:37.464 --> 00:06:40.868 align:middle line:84%
of passionate about the
potential health impact,

00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:46.006 align:middle line:84%
or am I most interested in the
legality and I want to look

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.674 align:middle line:90%
into a class action law suit.

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:51.044 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the issue,
on the solutions hub,

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:55.883 align:middle line:84%
what we're looking to do is
to coordinate it in as kind

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:58.385 align:middle line:90%
of organized way as it is.

00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.887 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you think about it,

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:84%
you know there's people
figuring out the planes.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.725 align:middle line:84%
There's people figuring
out the chemicals.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.661 align:middle line:84%
It has to be coordinated
with other flight patterns.

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:10.531 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a whole
orchestrated thing going on,

00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.866 align:middle line:84%
and so we need a whole
orchestrated thing going

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.535 align:middle line:90%
on to respond.

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:17.604 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
you know, one of the things

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.873 align:middle line:84%
about the research
that we did for Thrive

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that showed me just
how orchestrated

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:84%
and comprehensive this
agenda for control is,

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.183 align:middle line:84%
really made me see that
all of the good efforts

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.319 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing aren't
going to be sufficient

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.223 align:middle line:84%
if we don't also get organized
and share best practices.

00:07:36.223 --> 00:07:38.725 align:middle line:84%
You know, if China
is acknowledging

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:42.062 align:middle line:84%
that they're doing it, then
it's probably easy to get access

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:44.765 align:middle line:90%
to the data about what it is

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:47.334 align:middle line:84%
that they're acknowledging
doing, and then sharing

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:50.737 align:middle line:84%
that across into other
countries so that we even --

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.839 align:middle line:84%
you know, we can hit the
road running in terms

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.041 align:middle line:90%
of what questions to be asking.

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:58.011 align:middle line:84%
And so with the solutions hub,
what we're aiming to do is

00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle line:84%
to create a really easy
user friendly way for people

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to enter in what
they find and make it available

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
for groups anywhere else in
the world to have access.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.626 align:middle line:84%
So we're working on
the infrastructure

00:08:12.626 --> 00:08:14.528 align:middle line:84%
and getting the money
together to do that.

00:08:14.528 --> 00:08:17.364 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, you
know, people can go

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:20.567 align:middle line:84%
to the solutions hub and just
put in chemtrails and find

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:24.571 align:middle line:84%
out if there's a group
already in their region.

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:28.275 align:middle line:84%
I know yesterday I looked,
and there were over 60 groups.

00:08:28.275 --> 00:08:35.147 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that we can come
at this is a whole systems way

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:39.519 align:middle line:84%
and that while we're getting
our part together, there's a lot

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.787 align:middle line:90%
that people can be doing based

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:45.459 align:middle line:84%
on what's their own
particular purpose and passion.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the other thing

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.497 align:middle line:84%
that Thrive movement offers,
is just kind of the window

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:84%
into what's your
particular part.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.935 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do it all.

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:57.437 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be who you're not.

00:08:57.437 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:84%
You actually just need to
find out what's your purpose

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:02.509 align:middle line:84%
and then act in alignment
with that.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.779 align:middle line:84%
So that's available now
at the solutions hub

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.347 align:middle line:84%
that you can explore
your purpose.

00:09:07.347 --> 00:09:10.217 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's been one
of the most interesting things

00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:12.152 align:middle line:84%
to me, is to really
try to figure out how

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:14.955 align:middle line:84%
to take all these great
actions that are going on all

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:20.961 align:middle line:84%
over the world and provide the
tools for people to be empowered

00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:23.864 align:middle line:84%
to really coordinate with
others so that we don't have

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:27.167 align:middle line:84%
to each be reinventing the
wheel, because you know,

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:28.035 align:middle line:90%
you probably see that.

00:09:28.035 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I know we did traveling around.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.872 align:middle line:84%
There's someone working on
Chemtrails here, someone there,

00:09:31.872 --> 00:09:34.574 align:middle line:84%
but they're not talking
to each other, so...

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And as
Foster was describing

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:40.914 align:middle line:84%
in the video just before that
we have done on the free energy,

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.451 align:middle line:84%
there is some inventions also
out there and some ideas.

00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:47.554 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if that's
also the case for you

00:09:47.554 --> 00:09:50.691 align:middle line:84%
and for the chemtrails
in that particular area,

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.428 align:middle line:84%
if there is some things also
beyond just the conversation

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:55.896 align:middle line:90%
or the discussion.

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:59.032 align:middle line:84%
There's some things to stop
that on the technology side.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: I'm sure there are.

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:02.002 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that
that's part of it,

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.137 align:middle line:90%
is to get the coordination of --

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
from all the sectors
because I know as we --

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.477 align:middle line:84%
he's probably mentioned that as
we visited these different labs,

00:10:10.477 --> 00:10:14.481 align:middle line:84%
you know, there the technologies
for decontamination,

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:18.085 align:middle line:84%
and water purification,
and electricity,

00:10:18.085 --> 00:10:22.089 align:middle line:90%
and health technologies.

00:10:22.089 --> 00:10:25.759 align:middle line:84%
So I -- I mean I
couldn't be more impressed

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:29.796 align:middle line:84%
with humanity actually and
the resilience in innovation.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.198 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you get that traveling

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
around interviewing
wonderful people.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.768 align:middle line:90%
There are fabulous people all

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:39.106 align:middle line:84%
over the place doing amazing
things and I feel like we need

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:42.676 align:middle line:84%
to you know, do all that
we can to reflect that fact

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:45.946 align:middle line:84%
so that everybody knows
you're not alone in this.

00:10:45.946 --> 00:10:47.347 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot that we can do.

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:50.951 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that we are doing
and it's just a long haul,

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:53.553 align:middle line:84%
so you got to plug into
what you actually love

00:10:53.553 --> 00:10:54.788 align:middle line:90%
so you don't burn out.

00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:55.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:56.656 align:middle line:90%
You're taking a stand.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.658 align:middle line:84%
For you, clearly you
started this conversation

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.127 align:middle line:90%
by saying this is happening.

00:11:00.127 --> 00:11:02.696 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm -- this is
what we're accomplishing.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:04.397 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is done
kind of thing,

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:10.103 align:middle line:84%
and you have this you know,
this is amazingly bold to say

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:12.139 align:middle line:90%
that in this world, you know,

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:14.841 align:middle line:84%
that one woman can
make the difference.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:18.145 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's speaking out
and through this video too

00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:22.349 align:middle line:84%
and sharing it and
getting people to be part

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:25.786 align:middle line:84%
of this community and that's
how we're going to change it.

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.155 align:middle line:84%
We can't do it on our own
but we can voice it out

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and start speaking
our truth, huh?

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:30.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: Yeah.

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:90%
I think that's it.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean for me, I'm grateful that
I feel clear about it, you know.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.301 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my grandmother was
a suffragette and so I grew

00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:46.706 align:middle line:84%
up a lot listening to her about
what it is to take a stand

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.643 align:middle line:84%
for something, and I think
it really has a matter

00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:54.214 align:middle line:84%
of how well you know yourself,
because it's uncomfortable,

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:59.286 align:middle line:84%
of course, you know, to do
something that's socially bold.

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.888 align:middle line:84%
And I mean what's
stunning is that it's bold

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:04.124 align:middle line:84%
to question something
like heavy metals falling

00:12:04.124 --> 00:12:05.525 align:middle line:90%
out of the sky, you know.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:09.329 align:middle line:84%
Really, that's a very normal
thing to do the same way looking

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:11.665 align:middle line:84%
up and wondering what
other life forms there are

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:14.501 align:middle line:84%
in the universe is a
pretty natural question too.

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.971 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be completely
bold just to ask it out loud.

00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:22.042 align:middle line:84%
I think that's kind of weird, so
I'm willing to do it, you know,

00:12:22.042 --> 00:12:26.646 align:middle line:84%
but I'm grateful also that I had
early on, an example of a woman

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
in my life saying, you
know, if you act true

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.955 align:middle line:84%
to yourself then you end up
being able to sleep really well

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:38.191 align:middle line:84%
at night, and that's what
it really all kind of boils

00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:40.327 align:middle line:84%
down to, is peace
in your own heart.

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, and
following that intuition

00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:44.531 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we
don't really know why,

00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:46.233 align:middle line:90%
but maybe some woman or men

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.301 align:middle line:84%
that are hearing this
right now are saying,

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.737 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I've heard
of this or I've heard of this

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.573 align:middle line:84%
but it never hit a chord like
this, and right now I'm just

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:56.409 align:middle line:84%
so -- I feel compelled to
participate and to be part

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:58.078 align:middle line:84%
of it, and that's
exactly the impulse.

00:12:58.078 --> 00:12:59.913 align:middle line:90%
That's a life impulse, huh?

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Yeah, I think it
is, and I think for you know,

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.417 align:middle line:84%
especially like mothers to
realize that I don't know

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:06.953 align:middle line:84%
of anything more important
than raising conscious,

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:10.524 align:middle line:84%
healthy children on the
planet, and it just happens

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:13.627 align:middle line:84%
that these days, I don't
think you can do that anymore

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:18.131 align:middle line:84%
without being engaged in social
and political, you know --

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:19.566 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if political
is the right word,

00:13:19.566 --> 00:13:23.403 align:middle line:84%
but in ways that
impact what's going on.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:26.172 align:middle line:84%
Like this is -- these
chemtrails, these --

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.708 align:middle line:84%
the asthma rates are
off the charts you know,

00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:90%
so is infertility.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.179 align:middle line:84%
Those are things that we
can't ignore, and so I think

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:36.316 align:middle line:84%
for someone who feels like
their job is to you know,

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.919 align:middle line:84%
raise conscious children and do
the best thing that they can do

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:43.723 align:middle line:84%
on that, I think that it entails
being involved and engaged now

00:13:43.723 --> 00:13:46.293 align:middle line:84%
on a bigger level
because there are assaults

00:13:46.293 --> 00:13:49.663 align:middle line:84%
to our basic health
and well-being.

00:13:49.663 --> 00:13:52.365 align:middle line:84%
And so you know --
and, that you can do

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:54.601 align:middle line:84%
that in whatever
way it suits you.

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:57.704 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not everybody's
job to be a spokesperson for it,

00:13:57.704 --> 00:14:01.241 align:middle line:84%
but I think it is
everybody's job to be educated.

00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:04.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You were a journalist
for Newsweek International,

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:08.448 align:middle line:84%
so you were there putting some
information out in the world.

00:14:08.448 --> 00:14:11.985 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this is not something
that is covered by most media.

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:12.686 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: No.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.154 align:middle line:90%
No, I know, it's not.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.589 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's the reason
I'm not doing that anymore,

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.392 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not covering
the stories that I think need

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to be told, and also, I
just think it's so exciting

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.633 align:middle line:84%
to have the freedom of
the internet, and --

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:31.137 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly investigative
reporting is now relegated

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:32.439 align:middle line:90%
to the internet.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.207 align:middle line:84%
That's not what's happening
in the mainstream anymore.

00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.709 align:middle line:90%
That's just entertainment.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.812 align:middle line:84%
It's not really news you
know, and it's unfortunate.

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:41.014 align:middle line:84%
Entertainment is like the
horror show or something.

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:90%
But I think now that --

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:48.621 align:middle line:84%
yeah, really being able to go
wherever my passion leads me,

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:84%
you know, and this
is just one of those.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:53.827 align:middle line:84%
We dealt with it
during the spray here

00:14:53.827 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
for the supposedly Light
Brown Apple Moth, you know,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
this non-harmful insect that the
George Bush Administration had

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.572 align:middle line:84%
earmarked this billion
dollars to come down

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and do an aerial spray here.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.845 align:middle line:84%
And we organized using this
whole systems model with that,

00:15:11.845 --> 00:15:15.215 align:middle line:84%
which we've spoken
about in the movie also.

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:19.886 align:middle line:84%
But I know the feeling of these,
you know, planes going overhead

00:15:19.886 --> 00:15:22.756 align:middle line:84%
and spraying these
toxins and now looking up

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:27.227 align:middle line:84%
and the feeling is just like
wow, what an assault, you know.

00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:31.531 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's really
important to think like,

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
are you just going
to let that happen

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.068 align:middle line:84%
as if there's nothing
to do about it?

00:15:35.068 --> 00:15:36.903 align:middle line:90%
It's just people doing it.

00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:40.874 align:middle line:84%
There are people making
decisions that they can go ahead

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:44.144 align:middle line:84%
and do a program like that and
that we're not going to stop it.

00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:46.046 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are going to stop it.

00:15:46.046 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:84%
It's not an acceptable
thing to do.

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:52.152 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we just need to
know that we're in these times.

00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:55.855 align:middle line:84%
We happen to be born in times
where sitting back and thinking

00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:59.692 align:middle line:84%
that somehow it's going to be
okay if we're not involved.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:00.727 align:middle line:90%
Those days are gone.

00:16:00.727 --> 00:16:02.128 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
were ever here,

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.932 align:middle line:84%
but they're certainly not here
now and our job is to, I think,

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:07.967 align:middle line:84%
get educated and do
whatever your part is.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:10.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do you know
through the research,

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:13.073 align:middle line:84%
exactly the process
to get that to stop?

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:15.875 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same way that we
used to stop things or even

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:17.811 align:middle line:90%
that is being reinvented?

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: I think
it's pretty basic.

00:16:19.212 --> 00:16:22.215 align:middle line:84%
I think that stopping
things is like, you know,

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.317 align:middle line:84%
e're going to need a
class action law suit.

00:16:24.317 --> 00:16:26.653 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're going to
have to go at it legislatively,

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to have to
do some research on that.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:32.125 align:middle line:84%
People could be doing a lot
of homework right now so that

00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.562 align:middle line:84%
as we get our solutions hub
more enhanced and better

00:16:35.562 --> 00:16:38.431 align:middle line:84%
for sharing the information
globally, that we'll be able

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:39.966 align:middle line:84%
to hit the road running
with that.

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:43.169 align:middle line:84%
We're going to create a webinar
through thrivemovement.com

00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:46.706 align:middle line:84%
to take it on and help
organize it, but I think we know

00:16:46.706 --> 00:16:51.211 align:middle line:84%
that you know, what really
was significant was the data.

00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:53.847 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
credible information

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:57.083 align:middle line:84%
about what chemicals are being
sprayed, to follow the money,

00:16:57.083 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
find out what are the
planes that are being used,

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:84%
what are the corporations that
are funding it and behind it,

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and what are the legal -- I
mean, I know that there are laws

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.861 align:middle line:90%
that are being broken.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
international treaties?

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:84%
I think they have things
where they'll spray.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.966 align:middle line:84%
You know, they get
it so you can spray

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:15.368 align:middle line:90%
on someone else's territory

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:17.637 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
law maybe restricting

00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:19.239 align:middle line:84%
that you can spray
it on your own.

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:24.244 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot of
insidious and very well thought

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:28.848 align:middle line:84%
through stuff going on that you
know, whatever your skill is,

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:31.518 align:middle line:84%
there's some application
for it on this issue.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, maybe it's
write a song about it.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:37.624 align:middle line:84%
Skull wrote a great
song about chemtrails

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:40.126 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's draw
a poster you know,

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.495 align:middle line:84%
and help people become
aware of it that way,

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:45.498 align:middle line:84%
or to convene a community
that way and then post it

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:48.034 align:middle line:84%
and let people modify
it in their communities,

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:50.403 align:middle line:84%
and share what's
working and what isn't.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.773 align:middle line:84%
But I think getting hard core
data and also I think a map

00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:56.709 align:middle line:84%
of the whole chemtrail
network of who's doing what.

00:17:56.709 --> 00:17:59.913 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need that because
right now it's a little bit,

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:03.583 align:middle line:84%
you know, one faction over
here and another over there.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:06.953 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, there's
always just the human element

00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:10.156 align:middle line:84%
of how do we all work
together as human beings.

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.625 align:middle line:84%
That's where so much
of this breaks down.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:16.329 align:middle line:84%
You know, no matter
much we care together,

00:18:16.329 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
can we actually get along
with each other in the course

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.768 align:middle line:90%
of making these changes.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:25.705 align:middle line:84%
And we just had a visit
recently from a guy.

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:28.408 align:middle line:90%
He's in the movie, Evon Peter.

00:18:28.408 --> 00:18:33.146 align:middle line:84%
He's the youngest ever chief
of an Alaskan native tribe,

00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:36.883 align:middle line:84%
the Neetsaii Gwich'in, and
I learned something from him

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:41.588 align:middle line:84%
about decision making that has
been really relevant in all this

00:18:41.588 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and gives me hopes,
because I don't think

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.194 align:middle line:84%
that we can expect everyone's
going to agree on what moves

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to take when, but I think
that we can have principles

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
that we operate with and I
think we can have policies.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.074 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, you know, in
this tribe that's been going

00:19:01.074 --> 00:19:02.609 align:middle line:90%
on for thousands of years,

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:06.412 align:middle line:84%
how did they solve
problems and make decisions?

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:10.516 align:middle line:84%
And he described it where
if somebody had a dissenting

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:14.387 align:middle line:84%
opinion, that dissenting
opinion stayed on the table.

00:19:14.387 --> 00:19:16.956 align:middle line:84%
So even if the group
went ahead with the move,

00:19:16.956 --> 00:19:21.427 align:middle line:84%
every subsequent meeting,
they would visit that decision

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:24.998 align:middle line:84%
and see was the concern
still relevant or not.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:28.001 align:middle line:84%
And either the person would
feel like no, it got resolved.

00:19:28.001 --> 00:19:29.969 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to hold
onto that, or yeah,

00:19:29.969 --> 00:19:33.706 align:middle line:84%
the thing I was concerned about
has turned out to come to bear

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:36.576 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I was worried
about, and so we need to shift.

00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So somebody doesn't have to
feel shut up or excluded,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.684 align:middle line:84%
even though a group might move
on with a particular action.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.719 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really important.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:51.257 align:middle line:84%
We've really seen that both in
my activist days and Berkeley

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:56.195 align:middle line:84%
and then since then working on
the spray here, where, you know,

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.798 align:middle line:84%
some people are really
good at working alone.

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:01.134 align:middle line:90%
They're not good in groups.

00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:05.305 align:middle line:84%
Someone's just like really
a great data researcher

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:07.473 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't really
have the social skills.

00:20:07.473 --> 00:20:08.741 align:middle line:90%
Or it's like, great!

00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Do that and send us the
information, you know,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.414 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't have
to force people to work

00:20:14.414 --> 00:20:16.716 align:middle line:84%
in ways they don't want to
work or be who they aren't,

00:20:16.716 --> 00:20:21.321 align:middle line:84%
but you can take advantage of
everybody lending their part.

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:22.722 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he was
just here for a visit

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and I was reminded
of that, yeah.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There is,
in some industries,

00:20:27.927 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
or there's already solutions
that are being created,

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.599 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like my
conversation with Foster,

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:39.138 align:middle line:84%
I'm understanding that with the
free energy and there is already

00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:43.543 align:middle line:84%
so -- there's much solution
there coming together and a way

00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle line:84%
of operating that
could be duplicated

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.348 align:middle line:84%
in different industries,
different area.

00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:52.151 align:middle line:84%
You know, it seems like
not that it's one for all

00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:57.223 align:middle line:84%
because we're learning that it's
important to be individuals too,

00:20:57.223 --> 00:21:01.127 align:middle line:84%
but and it's not just one
plan for all and one plan

00:21:01.127 --> 00:21:04.364 align:middle line:84%
for all industries, but it seems
that there's so much commonality

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:07.233 align:middle line:84%
in all different areas like
chemtrails and like money

00:21:07.233 --> 00:21:10.069 align:middle line:84%
and like banking and like
media that could be --

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:13.606 align:middle line:84%
there's really a book that needs
to come out or a manual to,

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:17.243 align:middle line:84%
on how to recreate this
new world, and you know,

00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:18.878 align:middle line:90%
does it feel that way?

00:21:18.878 --> 00:21:22.048 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, I think it
still boils down to people

00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:25.184 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, you
know, and creating systems

00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:90%
that make it easier for people

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.457 align:middle line:84%
to make more compassionate,
wise choices.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, the free
energy technology like, for me,

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:90%
the technology is not the issue.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.968 align:middle line:84%
I'm utterly convinced
about the technology.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:45.037 align:middle line:84%
The issue is the
distribution, the manufacturing,

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:48.474 align:middle line:84%
and the distribution, and how do
we get it out in a way you know.

00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:52.211 align:middle line:84%
There are serious
repressive forces for that.

00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:55.948 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that you know,
with the new technology,

00:21:55.948 --> 00:21:59.619 align:middle line:84%
that people who are impacted
by it need to have some say

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:01.521 align:middle line:90%
in how it comes to be.

00:22:01.521 --> 00:22:05.058 align:middle line:84%
And what's a whole new
business model that acknowledges

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:09.162 align:middle line:84%
that the people who invented
it and invested in it want

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:12.331 align:middle line:84%
to be recouped for that, and at
the same time they don't want

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:15.902 align:middle line:84%
to become another big mega
corporation that, you know,

00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:19.071 align:middle line:84%
keeps it from getting out to all
the people who need it, like.

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:22.842 align:middle line:84%
So the new paradigm technology
is just the beginning.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:25.411 align:middle line:84%
Then it's the new paradigm
of social organizing

00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:27.013 align:middle line:90%
that I think we're really after.

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:28.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:22:28.114 --> 00:22:29.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: And so to
me, I think two things.

00:22:29.315 --> 00:22:32.218 align:middle line:84%
One is I think these times
call for us to realize

00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:36.956 align:middle line:84%
that our differences as, you
know, as real as they are,

00:22:36.956 --> 00:22:41.194 align:middle line:84%
have to be second
to our commitment

00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:45.031 align:middle line:84%
to work together effectively,
because we have a big problem.

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:47.233 align:middle line:90%
And most of us are not involved

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:49.569 align:middle line:84%
in consciously perpetuating
the problem,

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:52.238 align:middle line:84%
and we need to get
consciously involved

00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:57.677 align:middle line:84%
in perpetuating the solution,
you know, because it's going

00:22:57.677 --> 00:22:59.545 align:middle line:84%
on in a way that I think
we just have to rise

00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:02.582 align:middle line:84%
above our little personality
differences and I don't really

00:23:02.582 --> 00:23:04.217 align:middle line:84%
like how this person
does, whatever.

00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:05.685 align:middle line:90%
It's like too bad.

00:23:05.685 --> 00:23:08.054 align:middle line:84%
Work together effectively
just in order

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.389 align:middle line:84%
that we can make these
strides, and I think that's

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.925 align:middle line:84%
where the principles come
in and where realizing

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:17.096 align:middle line:84%
that we're really challenged
and invited now to do something

00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:18.865 align:middle line:90%
that hasn't been done before.

00:23:18.865 --> 00:23:21.467 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
where we, you know,

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:27.173 align:middle line:84%
we have so much spiritually
that binds us, and unites us,

00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:29.809 align:middle line:90%
and inspires us, and I don't see

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:34.147 align:middle line:84%
that the science can come
forward or the new policies

00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:39.552 align:middle line:84%
or anything without there being
that spiritual acknowledgment

00:23:39.552 --> 00:23:43.022 align:middle line:84%
that we're in this together
and we're being called to act

00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:45.124 align:middle line:90%
from our highest selves.

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:46.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes, it's very
much a social thing,

00:23:46.826 --> 00:23:50.563 align:middle line:84%
so we need to learn
how to co-create.

00:23:50.563 --> 00:23:52.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:52.064 --> 00:23:53.833 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there
are things I know.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.702 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot about
the whole group process

00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:58.304 align:middle line:90%
in the course of making Thrive.

00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I, in the past, I had been much
more someone who would want

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.477 align:middle line:84%
to get something pretty
together before sharing it,

00:24:04.477 --> 00:24:06.679 align:middle line:84%
and Foster was much
easier about --

00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:08.714 align:middle line:84%
like, let's share it
in really rough forms

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:10.082 align:middle line:90%
and get the feedback.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:12.785 align:middle line:84%
And we had -- it was such a
mammoth project that it turned

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:14.987 align:middle line:84%
out to be that was the
better way to do it,

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:19.825 align:middle line:84%
but I really benefited hugely
both from that group process

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:84%
and also from in my interactions
with him, because we just stayed

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:27.867 align:middle line:90%
with something long enough.

00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:33.039 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think that the core
bottom line with us was respect;

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:35.308 align:middle line:90%
that I knew that he was coming

00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:39.378 align:middle line:84%
at whatever he believed was
intelligent, and thoughtful,

00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:84%
and caring, because I know
that's who he is as a person,

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:43.883 align:middle line:90%
and he could know that about me.

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:46.252 align:middle line:84%
So as different as we
were in how we wanted

00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:50.022 align:middle line:84%
to approach something, he would
just go well, I'm not seeing it,

00:24:50.022 --> 00:24:52.325 align:middle line:84%
you know; however this is
as you're presenting it,

00:24:52.325 --> 00:24:53.726 align:middle line:90%
but we'll stay with it.

00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:56.495 align:middle line:84%
And through that, we always
got to something better,

00:24:56.495 --> 00:25:00.399 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I think
that's what we have to do now;

00:25:00.399 --> 00:25:03.936 align:middle line:84%
just stick with things with
each other until we can get

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:07.073 align:middle line:90%
to the breakthrough solutions.

00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.808 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm most excited.

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:13.045 align:middle line:84%
Like, my edge that I'm exploring
is what are these new paradigm

00:25:13.045 --> 00:25:14.313 align:middle line:90%
business models?

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, how do we do this
together in a way that honors

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.886 align:middle line:84%
that people need money to
survive and move forward?

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.021 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that money
is intrinsically bad.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.793 align:middle line:84%
I think that fake money
and subsidized money

00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:31.564 align:middle line:84%
and controlled money that's
not just where people get

00:25:31.564 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to see what's actually working,
and use that in an honest way.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.837 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what the problem
is; but how do we deal --

00:25:37.837 --> 00:25:40.906 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of like people
who have, you know,

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.174 align:middle line:90%
food addiction or something.

00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
You can't just get
rid of food, right?

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:47.213 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn a way to
deal with it in a healthy way,

00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:49.649 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like that's true
of a lot of our issues;

00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:52.718 align:middle line:84%
that it's been so
convoluted and corrupted

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:55.821 align:middle line:84%
and the class dynamics are
so off and all of that,

00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:59.792 align:middle line:84%
and we have to do a lot of
work to do healing on top

00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:01.327 align:middle line:90%
of the systems changing.

00:26:01.327 --> 00:26:04.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if we change
the money system and then

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, really
need to deal with what's gone

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.138 align:middle line:84%
down for generations
among and between us.

00:26:12.138 --> 00:26:16.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How about getting
some help from the ET's huh?

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:17.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: I'm sure
they're helping [laughter].

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:18.744 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: They can help
with the chemtrails.

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.647 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is more accessible
to them maybe than for us.

00:26:21.647 --> 00:26:26.052 align:middle line:84%
They could do a little --
maybe I don't know, spray.

00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:28.454 align:middle line:84%
They could spray some
other kind of chemical

00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:30.056 align:middle line:90%
that would hold it up.

00:26:30.056 --> 00:26:31.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: I don't know.

00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:36.162 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my personal relationship
to the whole ET phenomenon,

00:26:36.162 --> 00:26:37.997 align:middle line:90%
which I certainly believe

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:40.366 align:middle line:84%
that there's interaction
that's ongoing on this planet,

00:26:40.366 --> 00:26:45.071 align:middle line:84%
but my understanding is that
it's a lot like you relate

00:26:45.071 --> 00:26:49.075 align:middle line:84%
to a toddler or something,
you know, where you can --

00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:51.510 align:middle line:84%
if you sit your kid up
on top of the jungle gym,

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.879 align:middle line:84%
they won't know how to get
down because they didn't get

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.314 align:middle line:90%
up on their own, right?

00:26:55.314 --> 00:26:56.816 align:middle line:84%
You can support them
and guide them,

00:26:56.816 --> 00:26:58.551 align:middle line:84%
but they have to
do it themselves.

00:26:58.551 --> 00:27:01.921 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we're toddlers
in this scene, you know,

00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:03.989 align:middle line:84%
and that they -- I
think they're helping

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:07.193 align:middle line:84%
to stop the nuclear
radiation from escaping

00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:11.897 align:middle line:84%
into where it causes problems
a lot further than this planet.

00:27:11.897 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
on certain things,

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:17.369 align:middle line:90%
they're probably guiding us

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:21.774 align:middle line:84%
through our intuition
to respond to things.

00:27:21.774 --> 00:27:23.175 align:middle line:90%
I know I feel like that.

00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:27.513 align:middle line:84%
I feel like for me, I rely on
my meditation and my intuition

00:27:27.513 --> 00:27:30.416 align:middle line:84%
to help me just notice
like, what are the things

00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:34.186 align:middle line:84%
that are coming back around
for me and to slow down enough

00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:36.522 align:middle line:84%
to be able to hear
that and respond to it

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:39.024 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that, you
know, chemtrails is one

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:40.259 align:middle line:90%
that I'm going to take on.

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:42.828 align:middle line:84%
I think it has fundamentally
undermining our health

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:45.798 align:middle line:84%
and wellbeing and our
environment and our food supply,

00:27:45.798 --> 00:27:50.669 align:middle line:84%
and that's a bottom line thing
that we need to stop that.

00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:52.338 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's also something

00:27:52.338 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
that people can gain a
visceral sense of empowerment

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:01.147 align:middle line:84%
because I'm completely confident
that we will stop chemtrails,

00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and I think when that
happens, they'll realize oh,

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.652 align:middle line:90%
we can change anything.

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:09.922 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we apply the
same whole system and we learn

00:28:09.922 --> 00:28:12.792 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves and what's
our own particular purpose

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:16.295 align:middle line:84%
and passion, and we forgive
ourselves and we forgive others,

00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:18.697 align:middle line:84%
and we continue to work
together, and you know,

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:22.168 align:middle line:84%
just work on it so that we
improve ourselves enough

00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:24.503 align:middle line:84%
to be able to pull
these things off.

00:28:24.503 --> 00:28:26.839 align:middle line:84%
I think that people will
have the confidence from that

00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:29.241 align:middle line:84%
that they'll bring it
then to other issues.

00:28:29.241 --> 00:28:33.345 align:middle line:84%
So and I think the ET's
give us a ton of downloads

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:36.882 align:middle line:84%
through our intuition if
we take the time to listen,

00:28:36.882 --> 00:28:40.853 align:middle line:84%
but I don't personally -- I'm
not counting on them solving it

00:28:40.853 --> 00:28:44.456 align:middle line:84%
for us because I don't think
that's actually how we evolve,

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding is
that we're here to evolve.

00:28:49.495 --> 00:28:53.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And regarding health,
is there some other issues

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.901 align:middle line:84%
that you feel really
compelled, that are really --

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:59.605 align:middle line:84%
that you feel strong about
and want to actually - no,

00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:02.007 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure because with all
the information that you got

00:29:02.007 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and all this research and
working for eight years

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.478 align:middle line:84%
on this movie, there
must be tons of issues

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.648 align:middle line:84%
and you chose chemtrail, but
are there some other ones

00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:10.883 align:middle line:90%
and can you actually --

00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:13.719 align:middle line:84%
are there some that are
quite related to chemtrails

00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.354 align:middle line:90%
that could be worked on even

00:29:15.354 --> 00:29:16.922 align:middle line:84%
like it could be
transposed solution,

00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:19.124 align:middle line:84%
could be transposed
to that other issue.

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, I think --
I mean I know that you know,

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:24.597 align:middle line:84%
asthma and autism
have correlations

00:29:24.597 --> 00:29:27.933 align:middle line:84%
with heavy metal
pollution, right.

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.469 align:middle line:84%
So I think that people
who are impacted by either

00:29:30.469 --> 00:29:32.771 align:middle line:84%
of those would naturally
want to be involved.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I think the same thing
with infertility.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.009 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a huge
issue for young women,

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:40.646 align:middle line:84%
and that as they get educated,
like that it's not normal

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:43.515 align:middle line:84%
to be having all these
problems with conception

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:45.484 align:middle line:84%
and sperm counts being
down and everything,

00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:47.686 align:middle line:84%
and when they realize that
that's being done to them --

00:29:47.686 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if you think -- oh,
it's a corporation that's trying

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.027 align:middle line:84%
to help us, it's like
well, it's not working.

00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:56.095 align:middle line:90%
We're not being helped.

00:29:56.095 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
These things are
really problematic.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that it's
a benevolent motivation

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:02.368 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't matter.

00:30:02.368 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
That's my, you know,
my view of it is that.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.805 align:middle line:84%
Someone else's is
something else.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The point is, it's
causing damage

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.409 align:middle line:90%
and we know that in common.

00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:12.778 align:middle line:84%
So I think those would
be related health issues

00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:14.346 align:middle line:90%
for me personally.

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:21.253 align:middle line:84%
I see this whole cancer epidemic
as an unnecessary, you know,

00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:25.557 align:middle line:84%
painfully unnecessary
situation and I...

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:28.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What did you say that
what's going on with cancer?

00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:32.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, it's rampant
and I believe that there --

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:38.203 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are cures
which have been repressed

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:40.339 align:middle line:84%
because when you
look at the industry,

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:42.841 align:middle line:90%
just the cancer industry,

00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:46.245 align:middle line:84%
they're not looking
for true cures.

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:50.215 align:middle line:84%
And so that whole connection
between the pharmaceuticals

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:54.019 align:middle line:84%
and the medical practice
here, and the repression

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:57.156 align:middle line:84%
of the alternatives, I think
that that's going to end.

00:30:57.156 --> 00:30:59.058 align:middle line:84%
I think that's another thing
that's going to change.

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:01.827 align:middle line:84%
I think that you know, we
had at dinner last night,

00:31:01.827 --> 00:31:04.697 align:middle line:84%
we talked about what's
our vision of the world

00:31:04.697 --> 00:31:08.467 align:middle line:90%
when we die, and what can it be.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:10.569 align:middle line:84%
What can it be and what
do we think it will be,

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:90%
like at that time?

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:12.604 align:middle line:90%
So I'm 61.

00:31:12.604 --> 00:31:15.274 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking okay,
in 30 or 40 years,

00:31:15.274 --> 00:31:16.675 align:middle line:90%
what do I think it will be.

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:20.179 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we
will absolutely be done

00:31:20.179 --> 00:31:26.051 align:middle line:84%
with chemtrails and nuclear;
that we'll have free energy

00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:30.255 align:middle line:84%
and that the free energy
will also shift a paradigm

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:33.092 align:middle line:84%
and that it will really
improve our human relations

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:35.661 align:middle line:84%
because instead of
being the scarcity model

00:31:35.661 --> 00:31:39.932 align:middle line:84%
of if you have it, I don't, and
there isn't enough to go around.

00:31:39.932 --> 00:31:41.367 align:middle line:90%
It will be that we are --

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:45.170 align:middle line:84%
our technology will prove
that we are part of an alive,

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.541 align:middle line:84%
abundant infinite universe;
that there is more than enough

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:54.213 align:middle line:84%
for all of us and that that
will impact our fundamental

00:31:54.213 --> 00:31:58.884 align:middle line:84%
spirituality and connection,
and it will be able

00:31:58.884 --> 00:32:01.854 align:middle line:84%
to shift how we're relating to
one another, and that that's

00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:03.555 align:middle line:84%
where the real healing
will begin.

00:32:03.555 --> 00:32:08.394 align:middle line:84%
And I feel confident that that,
and that real healing modalities

00:32:08.394 --> 00:32:11.897 align:middle line:84%
that are dealt more with
vibrational medicine that go

00:32:11.897 --> 00:32:14.099 align:middle line:84%
at being able to
-- first of all,

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:17.636 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'll be having
as many cancer tumors starting

00:32:17.636 --> 00:32:20.272 align:middle line:84%
and for when they are, I
think the way to get rid

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:23.776 align:middle line:84%
of them will not be by making
the whole body toxic and sick,

00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:28.113 align:middle line:84%
but by using vibration to break
down just those tumors that need

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:29.948 align:middle line:84%
to be broken down
and reabsorbed.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:33.185 align:middle line:84%
So I think all that
will happen within --

00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:36.255 align:middle line:84%
well, a lot sooner
than the next 40 years,

00:32:36.255 --> 00:32:39.458 align:middle line:84%
but it will be happening
and I'll do my part to help.

00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:42.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And when we see the
placebo effect and what it does,

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:46.899 align:middle line:84%
sure we can self-heal too, and
learn that because it seems

00:32:46.899 --> 00:32:48.901 align:middle line:84%
like we have so much
inside and we haven't

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:50.936 align:middle line:90%
yet really explored, huh?

00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:51.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Isn't
that interesting?

00:32:51.904 --> 00:32:53.305 align:middle line:90%
I always thought it was amazing

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:57.009 align:middle line:84%
that the placebo effect
was considered like oh,

00:32:57.009 --> 00:32:58.343 align:middle line:90%
it was just a placebo.

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:01.713 align:middle line:84%
I mean what that signifies
is the power of belief.

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:06.185 align:middle line:84%
I just read Bruce Lipton's
book,  The Biology of Belief .

00:33:06.185 --> 00:33:07.786 align:middle line:90%
I really recommend it.

00:33:07.786 --> 00:33:12.991 align:middle line:84%
It was fabulous, about the power
of our belief and the power

00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:16.895 align:middle line:84%
to change our beliefs and
to really break legacies

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:20.599 align:middle line:84%
that we each come in with
on the planet at this time.

00:33:20.599 --> 00:33:22.968 align:middle line:84%
And I think that, you
know, that's where so much

00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:26.205 align:middle line:84%
of this begins, is in that
fundamental relationship

00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves and
what is our world view,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.343 align:middle line:84%
and what do we believe, and
what responsibility do we want

00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to take for our beliefs
and how those get manifest.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:33:36.582 --> 00:33:39.618 align:middle line:84%
I love when we leave it there
also too because it all happens

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:43.922 align:middle line:84%
in here, and it starts in here,
and I think we're just amazing

00:33:43.922 --> 00:33:48.093 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't yet found
the how amazing we are,

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:50.629 align:middle line:84%
and this is just the
beginning of something big.

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:52.498 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:33:52.498 --> 00:33:56.001 align:middle line:84%
Is there a last thing that
you want to leave us with?

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Gamble: Well, I
think just to say,

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:02.207 align:middle line:84%
to remind people how
amazing we really are.

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:03.342 align:middle line:84%
I think that -- I
think that you're...

00:34:03.342 --> 00:34:04.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That was great.

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:04.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Gamble: Yes.

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:05.811 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's true.

00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:09.314 align:middle line:84%
It's the mirror I've
seen from, you know,

00:34:09.314 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:84%
Thrive having 18
million documented views

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.253 align:middle line:84%
in the last year and
a half or something.

00:34:14.253 --> 00:34:18.289 align:middle line:84%
I hear from people all over
the world, and I am so inspired

00:34:18.289 --> 00:34:23.028 align:middle line:84%
by the quality of
innovation, and care, and love,

00:34:23.028 --> 00:34:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and resilience, and just
kindness, and goodness,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.936 align:middle line:84%
and engagement that's
being reflected back.

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:33.037 align:middle line:90%
So I have nothing but high hopes

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:36.074 align:middle line:84%
and I know we have a big long
journey ahead, and I'm grateful

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.410 align:middle line:84%
for the work that you're
doing as part of it.

00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.978 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, so much.

00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:41.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Thank you.

00:34:41.213 --> 00:34:43.414 align:middle line:84%
And it's for me, meeting
people like you is healing,

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:48.287 align:middle line:84%
so hopefully that offers a
lot of healing to whoever

00:34:48.287 --> 00:34:50.655 align:middle line:84%

watching this video right now.

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:53.792 align:middle line:84%
I send you much, much love my
delicious co-creator and I hope

00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:57.362 align:middle line:84%
that many, many more [Background
Music] videos will bring another

00:34:57.362 --> 00:34:59.898 align:middle line:84%
piece of the puzzle for
you so that you can thrive.

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:01.066 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God, I love that word.
