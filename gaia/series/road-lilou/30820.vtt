00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:90%
Hello, my beautiful co-creators.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.290 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, delicious,
juicy interview for you guys

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
right from Orlando, sunny
Orlando, with Mike Dooley.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Mike.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Lilou.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, because this is your city.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:90%
This is home town.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
It's always been?

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:90%
For about 20 years now.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Came here at a pivotal
time in my life.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I had just left the corporate
world and was starting over,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and Orlando was a
great place to do it.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've been here ever since.
Yeah.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So you're very well known for
your Notes from the Universe.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:10%
You have over half
a million people,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.781 align:middle line:10%
and you're sending your notes,
your delicious citations.

00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It started from a database
of 36 email addresses

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
when we had t-shirts-- mom,
Andy and I-- in Orlando,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
we had several stores,
and we had a guest book.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
When people signed
the-- people tend

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:90%
to want to sing guest books.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So when emails came out-- and
this was back in the day, which

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:84%
was not that long
ago-- people would

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:90%
write down their email address.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And so from that, we put
together a little database.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first mailing
was to 36 people.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And we're at about a
half a million right now.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.121 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, you
were featured in the movie

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
The Secret.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot of you
guys have seen that movie.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:90%
How was that?

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:90%
That was awesome.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:84%
There was such a
vibe and a buzz.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I had heard from
Rhonda and Glenda.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%
It was Rhonda's project.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
She was doing it
with her sister.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They were big fans from
Melbourne, Australia.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were coming to
the US to do a documentary,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and would I be interested.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I was very
skeptical at that time.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know them.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I had just finished
my first world tour.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded
compelling, though.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And they offered to fly
me to Chicago first class.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
this is interesting.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I met them,
it was like-- it

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:90%
was pretty electrifying.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Rhonda was so
convinced that this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
was going to rock the world.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
You can look back and see it
clearly, kind of supernatural.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
At the time, it was
an exciting moment.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.007 align:middle line:90%
But who knows?

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:90%
And so we did the interview.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It went really well.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't meet a single person.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I went in and left the
same day at the hotel.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's how most
of it was filmed.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
We were not all together
for the most part.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the excitement
just built and built,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and I got phone calls
and emails and stuff

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:90%
from Melbourne, Australia.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And as the launch
approached, it was pretty

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
clear it was going to be big.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We all wanted it to be
big, but sometimes it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:90%
goes beyond what you want.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:90%
There's just this vibe.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the names, the roster of the
people in it was in increasing.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:90%
And that was a turning point.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about the law of attraction,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that thoughts become
things, and all of that.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But originally,
you were working--

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.157 align:middle line:84%
you were a consultant for
Price Cooper Waterhouse, huh?

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:03.129 align:middle line:90%
Tax consultant.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.162 align:middle line:90%
Today's PricewaterhouseCoopers.

00:03:04.162 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
conventional background,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
which I think has
served me, because it

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
perhaps grounds what I teach.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I come from a very objective,
black and white, debit

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and credit, it's got a
balance kind of background.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And with that grounding, I can
talk about the woo woo, if you

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
will, with maybe,
to some people,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more credibility.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't take anything on a whim.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a school of
thought that you should.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But I like to chisel
down and get objective.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And then now as a
teacher, take people

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
from something they can almost
tangibly feel or sense and take

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
them into the arena
that I want to take them

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to with the
realization that we are

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the eyes and ears
of the divine come

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:90%
alive in the dream of life.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:90%
We're here by choice.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:90%
We're eternal beings.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And here, one of the
absolutes that I teach

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
is that our thoughts
unfailingly become the things

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
and events of our life.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no mitigating
factors-- not karma,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
not ancient spiritual contracts,
not what kind of mood God

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:90%
is in.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no tests.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
We create our own tests,
and they're very effective.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
When it hurts, it
causes us to realign

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:90%
and get closer to truth.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It's all about truth.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And so from a very conventional
background-- six years

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of PricewaterhouseCoopers,
certified public accountant,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
international tax specialty--
I decided I wanted more.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't who I was.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Respected the firm,
loved the camaraderie,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
but I quit not knowing
what I would do.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the biggest
turning points of my life.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Boston.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Sold my condo,
resigned at the manager

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:90%
level, six years with the firm.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And rented a Ryder truck
to move to Orlando, Florida

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to figure it out.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
My thinking by then was since
no one came along and rescued me

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
from the ivory towers of the
corporate world, which I was so

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
sure they were going to do,
that I better force things

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
or I would be there forever.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And so I just quit.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Rumors were rampant in
the firm, in the office.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I heard Mike Dooley is
going to open a bookstore.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
No, he's opening
a hardware store.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
No, he's going to
do a Blockbuster

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Video store with his mom.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I was like, where does
this stuff come from?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:90%
None of the above were true.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The truth was, I had no flipping
idea what I would do next.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
But I was right.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
That did force change-- not just
in the termination of my career

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
at Pricewaterhouse,
but all of a sudden,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
it was like jumping in
the deep end of the pool

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and learning how
to swim as you go.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:90%
I had to figure it out.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:90%
I had to do something.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And so within a few months,
teamed up with mom, my brother,

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.905 align:middle line:84%
and we launched what
is today's tut.com.

00:05:51.905 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But back then, Tut was just
the name of a little character.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a logo on
our t-shirt company.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
We started selling
t-shirts from a push cart

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:90%
on a sidewalk downtown Orlando.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it evolved into
totally unique t-shirts,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because we had this
huge line of t-shirts.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we had gifts, and
all of the gifts and t-shirts

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.660 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of writing on it about
life, dreams, and happiness.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
That's my first stab, if
you will, at being a teacher

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
without even thinking of
myself as being a teacher.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the name evolved
into Totally Unique Thoughts

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
well before the advent
of the internet.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
When internet came along,
we wanted a domain name.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And I had a friend
who kept nudging

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:90%
me who knew about this stuff.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
He's like, get tut.com
before it's gone.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Back then, you could get
two-digit domain names.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And I dragged my feet
for eight months.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I thought, oh,
I'll just get it, and I did.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And because it's such a
short, memorable domain name,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Tut has stuck.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And now we don't really
do much in t-shirts.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't use the phrase
Totally Unique Though so much.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
But because the domain
name is so precious,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:90%
that's how I'm known.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the home base of
all that I do today.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You definitely made
some good choices.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.620 align:middle line:84%
You made some--
the right decision.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
You did step in the
unknown, not knowing.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of teachers speak about
this stepping in the unknown,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
not knowing, but you
did make those calls.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, I teach now.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:90%
You've got to step.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And it will always seem like
you're stepping into an abyss,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but it's dark and it's
foggy and you can't really

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
see what's in front of you.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.127 align:middle line:84%
But if you step, the
land will appear.

00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice of
you to say that I've

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%
made a lot of right decisions.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:90%
But for--

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Seems like it.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
For anybody at the
crossroads thinking

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of making their own
major decisions,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one necessarily to
advocate such a drastic life

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
change as my own.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But for anyone in
such a situation,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
they may feel like, well,
I would do it too if I

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:90%
could make some good decisions.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I had no confidence.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I had no clear path.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I looked back
over my shoulder and thought,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:84%
was that the biggest
mistake of my life,

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%
leaving Pricewaterhouse?

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:90%
I was timid.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:90%
I was doubtful.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I was at times negative.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
But what I teach now is that
we are so inclined to succeed.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
A moment ago, I
said we are the eyes

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and ears of God Almighty come
alive in the dream of life.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't speaking figuratively.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:90%
I was speaking literally.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And God doesn't go where
God doesn't want to go.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And while you can't remember the
choices that brought you here,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
you can still deduce and discern
that you are of the divine,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
so they had to be pretty
dang good choices.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
You knew what you were
doing from on high

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:90%
when you said me, there, now.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And so the game unfolds.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that you are of the divine,

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:84%
you realize you have an
innate inclination to succeed.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a tendency--
a sad tendency--

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
in our primitive times,
spiritually speaking,

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to think that it's
survival of the fittest,

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:90%
a dog-eat-dog world.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Watch the Discovery Channel,
and it's like good luck

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:90%
if you want to get ahead.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
The odds are against you.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And because we thought that,
we've experienced that.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you take a
step back and realize

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that the idea of 50-50 survival
is such a joke-- if you just

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
take stock of your own
life, no matter who you are,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
you have laughed more
than you've cried.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
You've smiled more
than you frowned.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.580 align:middle line:84%
You've had clarity--
believe it or not--

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:90%
more than you've been confused.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
You've had friends more
than you've been alone.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
You've had money
more than you've been

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:90%
flat broke or in the negative.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Evidencing what I'm saying,
which is a core tenet of what

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I teach, to get your
groove on, wake up

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to the fact, the
obvious fact, that you

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:90%
are inclined to succeed.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Every single day,
every single one of us

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
is being pushed on to greatness.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we just see this in
our life, then all of a sudden

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
we realize we're not at the
whim of a hoped-for good idea.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no bad ideas.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
No matter what road
you start out on,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you're going to end
up on the right road.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.720 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
which direction you go.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I use GPS navigation
as an analogy

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of my programs.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.430 align:middle line:84%
You need an end result.
That's all you need.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know how
you're going to get there.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Those are the cursed hows.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:84%
That's the original sin,
the forbidden fruit-- brain

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.160 align:middle line:90%
is too small, don't even try.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Just know where you want to
go-- champagne and caviar,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
friends and laughter, wealth and
abundance, health and harmony.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Know what that end result
is, that priority is,

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:84%
so you can program
it into divine GPS.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Step 2, just like
in your car, you've

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.234 align:middle line:90%
got to put the thing in gear.

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't put their
car in gear, because they're

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.150 align:middle line:90%
like, well, I don't know how.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
I'm going to go.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know which is the way.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Of course you don't know how.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:90%
You brain is too small.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Divine intelligence knows how.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to give
it a hand, a leg up,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:90%
by putting your car in gear.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as true in life as
it is with the car navigation.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't go wrong.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You go the opposite way that it
theoretically wanted you to go,

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and quickly enough, you will
hear make a legal U-turn.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll be guided
because you're rolling.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're not rolling-- if
your car is in park-- you're

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
literally telling
divine intelligence,

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenal networking
machine that you're not ready,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that now is not
the time, you need

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:90%
to get your ducks in a row.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter if you've got

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:90%
a vision board in the backseat.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if there's a
gratitude rock in your pocket.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Oprah's not calling.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.270 align:middle line:90%
You're not going anywhere.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But start rolling
down any old path,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and they will all seem--
excuse me-- sucky at first.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what I tell
people who really don't

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
know which path to choose.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Assess your options.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
If they are like mine were
20 years ago and then again

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
at another crossroads in
my life just 12 years ago,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
they will all suck.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Choose the least sucky and go.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And once you're rolling, having
programmed divine intelligence

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.270 align:middle line:84%
with your end result-- that's
all you needed to give it--

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
abundance, a job that I
love, a great travel partner,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is that you want.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It knows how, and it's
sending you emissaries

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:90%
and guidance and angels.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It will connect the dots
for you if you just show up.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're bound to have
more confidence showing up--

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
taking this back to where I
was a moment ago-- when you

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
understand the truth about
the nature of reality,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.440 align:middle line:84%
that you are inclined to
succeed, you are of the divine,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
you didn't come here
to get beaten down.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Look at how well we're
doing as a civilization

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
right now in the height
of our spiritual naivete.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Look at the commerce.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Look at the technology.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Look at the social networking.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Look at the love that's rampant.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The posts on
Facebook and Twitter,

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
more often than not-- maybe it's
my circle, but I think not--

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
there's these warm
and fuzzy tales.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:90%
There's inspiration.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the nature of
reality that we live in,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and we have these default
settings of abundance.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So with that awareness,
that simple truth

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that you are of the divine
and inclined to succeed-- you

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
then program the
end results, and you

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
show up down these sucky paths
with simple little baby steps.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And they don't have to be sucky.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just if you're
starting over like I have

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.480 align:middle line:90%
at several times in my life.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Your sails will be caught
by the infinite, unfailing

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:58.811 align:middle line:84%
winds of the universe, and your
way will be made clear for you.

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Wow.
All of that.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%
And we know how hard it is.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We hear it, and then it's a
matter of bringing it down to--

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The times that we've
been born into,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.155 align:middle line:84%
times that we chose to be
born into for the adventure

00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:14.732 align:middle line:84%
of the whole thing, for the
emotions that they would evoke.

00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:15.432 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
We knew then, and
we can sense right

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
now that this is
all being played

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:90%
out in the palm of God's hand.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Not to put God out there.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
God ain't out there.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.920 align:middle line:84%
God is inside of every
single one of us.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We are of God.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
But we're safe.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:90%
We're sound.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.300 align:middle line:90%
You know the movie Avatar?

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:90%
You saw that, I'm sure.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The planet Pandora,
and there was

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
the earthling, the hero of
the movie, who was a cripple.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So he would go into this
vestibule or this-- what

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.430 align:middle line:84%
was that-- a test tube and
chamber, and his consciousness

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:84%
would be projected out into
this native of the environment.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in reality, our
consciousness, our core,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
our heart is off in the palm
of God's hand somewhere,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and we have animated these
bodies made of this planet

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get our
groove on and think

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that we might become less,
think that crazy stuff happens.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:84%
All the while, we're actually
discovering that we're

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:90%
at the helm of our ship.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the main reasons

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
we're here-- to discover this
power that's innate in all

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of us so that we can
have these adventures,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we can fall in love
again and again, not only

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
with the world,
but with ourselves

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and go to a place in awareness
that we could not have gone

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
to had it not been
for the odyssey

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
into these illusionary
jungles of time and space.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you were just saying
it can seem so difficult,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and when we hear it,
we resonate with it,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:90%
but then tomorrow, we forget it.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
That's because we chose to be
born into incredibly primitive

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
times, spiritually speaking,
where the entire world,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's wise
grandparents or soppy TV shows

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:84%
or terrifying movies--
they're reminding us

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're getting older,
our time is limited,

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:90%
we're falling apart.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Statistically, chances
of getting ahead

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:84%
aren't that good, so you
better take some more medicine,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
have some more skin
cream, go back to school.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything is telling
us that we're doomed,

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:90%
and so we buy into it.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But because of our inclination
to succeed-- one of the things

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I advocate to people I speak
with is just do your best

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:90%
to immerse yourself in truth.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, all of the interviews
you've done-- 2,000, the eight

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
books I've written, the four
audio programs, and there's

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
countless other
teachers that are tuned

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:90%
into the same kind of truth.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So any viewer right now
who feels the excitement

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't want to fall back
out of the boat tomorrow--

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
well, just have
the audio program.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Get the application
for your Android.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Subscribe to Notes
From the Universe.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
reassured and bolstered

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:90%
with the confidence you need.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
The cool thing was everybody
that's part of Gaiam,

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
they have all those thousands
of videos and movies

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and documentaries and
interviews from so many people,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
people that want it.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, all
of a sudden, life

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
shows up in a different
way, and we're

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:90%
right back at ground zero.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a couple
of thoughts that

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:90%
come to mind when you say that.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
One is a personal
revelation that I've had

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:90%
in the last couple of years.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- everyone-- is all
about, whether they admit it

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:90%
or not, changing their life.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I first
realized that, I

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:84%
was like are we a
sorry bunch of misfits

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
or what that no
one is satisfied?

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But with a deeper look at
that, that doesn't need

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
to be the conclusion we draw.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.535 align:middle line:84%
Being the eyes and
ears of God, do

00:16:36.535 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
you think there's a
stopping point where

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
you'd like-- OK, I made it.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I won the gold medal.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Now let me just go back to aw.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Divine intelligence is way
too cool, way to adventurous

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So what divine intelligence
has as its own characteristic--

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
inevitably, guaranteed, and it's
a part of all of our heritage

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
and chemistry, or
DNA, if you will--

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
is that we are all blessed with
a divine sense of incompletion.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a curse.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a hallmark of greatness.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
It means, however, that we
will always feel incomplete.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We will always feel like
once I get this, I want that.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
And once I polish that off,
oh, it's dusty over there.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:84%
This means we're always going
to have an adventure before us.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We're always going to
find some way to grow.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
No matter how
great we've become,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
no matter how loving we've
become, there's another level.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So realize that just because you
don't yet have what you want,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean there's
something wrong with you.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a given for
the rest of consciousness's

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:90%
existence.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
There will always be stuff you
want but you don't yet have.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So you learn to be happy even
as you strive to become more,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because you will forever
be striving to become more.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, don't
put your happiness

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
off until that day
you feel complete,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:90%
because it's not coming.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So not getting frustrated at
what we don't have, but be

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:84%
grateful for having those
dreams and feeling the vibration

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
of that thing that we
want and those things

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:90%
without making ourselves wrong.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The only way there could
ever be a dream come true

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is if there was a moment before
it when it hadn't come true.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Every want or desire speaks
to growth and greatness

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:90%
that has not yet existed.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So just because
something is even greater

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you have to be
unhappy with where you are.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
You can be rocking happy
with where you are.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
settling for less.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is how you grease
the wheels-- be happy now.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you find
a sense of peace

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:84%
with your ever-yearning
desire for growth

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and you can smell the
flowers on the way

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the mountain,
then it gets easy.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Then at long last,
we enjoy the journey

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that we've always been told to
enjoy but no one seems to be

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
doing it, and the
whole adventure takes

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:90%
on a different coloration.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
We can be happy in the moment
even with credit card debt,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
even filing for bankruptcy, even
recovering from a broken heart.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:90%
You can be happy now.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It's in your mind.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.585 align:middle line:84%
And this will blast you
forward into new realms.

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a misconception,
then, that if we

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
are grateful for those
small little things in life,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
we won't get stuck with
those small little things?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.070 align:middle line:84%
That makes me think of
something that somebody

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:90%
said in an audience of mine.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I was telling them using
my little matrix tool

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that happiness is truly
the ultimate end result.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate dream.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate desire.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Most people falsely
interpret that

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.570 align:middle line:90%
as be happy with what you have.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people interpret
that as settling for less.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people interpret that
as happiness is important

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and material things aren't.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Stop the train.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
I advocate happiness

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
being the ultimate end
result is because it

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
makes you a money magnet.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It makes you a
confidence magnet.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It makes you a joy
magnet for even more.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
This is how you get more money--
by focusing on happiness.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Don't focus on happiness
because money is not important.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Money is important.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only thing.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more, and
you can be happy without it.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:90%
But you need not exclude it.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing at all remotely
unspiritual about money.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Unspiritual?
Right.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So by focusing-- it's
interesting, because when we

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
are broke and we have
the heart broken,

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
how can I be grateful for not
having this partner in my life?

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:84%
How can I be grateful for not
having that money in my life?

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes
possible heights

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:90%
that you have not yet imagined.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And everyone deserves--
and I would even say

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
needs-- the time of grief,
the time of healing,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:90%
a timeout in their life.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But I would just say do
your best not to wallow

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
and not to get stuck there.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's
impossible to ultimately

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
get stuck there, because we are
so inclined to move forward.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in
that place or you're

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
bedridden because you're
sick and you're just

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
like, how could
this happen to me?

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Look at everybody outside
playing and having a good time.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm sick, and
what's wrong with me?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:84%
See it as part of
the process that

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
makes more and more
happiness, love,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
harmony, whatever possible.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.790 align:middle line:90%
All of us have dreams.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And every dream, as
I said a moment ago,

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is a benchmark for a place we
have never been before in terms

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of thought, in terms
of belief, in terms

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.880 align:middle line:90%
of how we define possible.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And so every unfulfilled dream
and wish is a gift, as Richard

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Bach said in Illusions.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So just because you don't
have what you now want,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.490 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean you're
not going to get it.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, if you're in a
low point, where you are

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:90%
is never who you are.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Where you've been
is no indicator

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:90%
of where you're going.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And while that might not soothe
the pain of a broken heart,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
for a good long time,
at least it perhaps

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
will plant a seed for later
growth, future ripening,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and you will be happy again.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
You will see that you
were inclined to succeed.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was simply
a matter of getting

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:90%
clear with your priorities.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:90%
What is it, money?

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:90%
What is it, health?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Was is it, a relationship?

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And then do something about it,
no matter how feeble it seems.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
It will always seen
feeble in the beginning.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Take the baby steps.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So living the dream-- how
do we reach the dream,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:90%
how do we define the dream?

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:84%
It seems sometimes that we are
dreaming other people's dream.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
That's very true, and it
can get very complicated.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I for one want to
avoid any complications.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to define happiness.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:90%
What is happiness?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It's great to get a
lot of perspectives.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it's a
matter of just tuning

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:90%
into your own inner barometer.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Where are you right
now, and apart

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:84%
from enjoying and
making the most of it,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:90%
where would you like to be?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Where would you like to go?

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Without a road
map for right now,

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
without examining or untangling
your self-sabotaging,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
invisible limiting beliefs--
all that's too complicated.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
As I teach in my programs, my
workshops, playing the matrix--

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
there's basically two steps--
define what you want in terms

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:84%
of the end result. And if
happiness is too nebulous,

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:90%
then don't go there.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
It happiness is too nebulous,
say I want more health.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a
busier social life.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a job that
I don't even call a job.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It's play.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I want to have more money.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to travel
internationally.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Just decide what
some of these are.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You're not excluding
anything else.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And now you've got direction.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:90%
That's step one.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Step two is do something
about it every day.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Just be out there in the world.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And don't be discouraged
that it seems daunting.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.750 align:middle line:90%
If it hasn't manifested yet?

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.580 align:middle line:90%
It takes time.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And just like a pot that never
seems to never boil when you're

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
watching it, you're
going to get there faster

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
if you stop noticing
what's missing in your life

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and you master what's
in front of you,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:90%
one little step at a time.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I started out sending emails
for free to people with no light

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the tunnel.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I would imagine
you started doing

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
interviews not knowing how
it would ever come together.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But because you
showed up and you

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.900 align:middle line:84%
did it to the best of your
ability, now you're distracted.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.407 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
one more phone call,

00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's one more light
at the end of the tunnel,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
because so and
so's assistant just

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:90%
called you back and said maybe.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're in the
throes and you're moving.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:90%
This is life.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.034 align:middle line:90%
It's not the destination.

00:24:21.034 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not getting there.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But because you have a
destination and an end result--

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and I would urge everyone
to have dreams-- that's

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
what end results are--
now you've got direction,

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and now you're moving.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought a minute
ago that I was

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.470 align:middle line:84%
going to take you on a tangent
based on a question you said.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Somebody raised their
hand once and said,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
what if I choose happiness
as my only end result?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And the person could clearly
see there was some reason to do.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Even old school
tells you be happy.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's all I get-- what
if I just end up happy?

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And while it brought about a lot
of laughs in the auditorium--

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:84%
the irony of worrying
about only being happy--

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:90%
their fear was legitimate.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:90%
What if I'm happy and broke?

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:90%
What if I'm happy and sick?

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
What if I'm happy and
alone and unemployed?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, the
universe is you.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.735 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
things from the Bible-- and I

00:25:13.735 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
am not religious, not
anything in that area.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I was raised a Catholic, so
I've got some rooting there.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:90%
But I pick and choose.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:90%
I cherry pick from the Bible.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the things from the
Bible was before you even ask,

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:90%
you're heard.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is so true.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to say I
want money and to be happy.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.610 align:middle line:84%
If you say happy,
really woo hoo happy

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
dance happy-- this
is what I want,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
this is my end result-- you
visualize for five minutes

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.520 align:middle line:84%
every day just dancing around,
being happy without a reason--

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to give
yourself a reason--

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that energy goes out into the
universe like a thunderclap.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And by law, it comes
back as people and places

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and circumstances that will
stimulate that reaction

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:90%
from you all over again.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.821 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's made manifest.

00:25:54.821 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It's become a thing.
You're happy for a reason.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The universe will figure
out the reasons for you.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you're putting out that
kind of happiness, when you're

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:84%
visualizing or when
you're driving to work

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:84%
or your walking the dog or
falling asleep at night,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.591 align:middle line:84%
and you're exuding joy
for no reason-- and this

00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is easy to do.
You just fake it.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:90%
I do it with my audiences.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
We just do woo, woo, and
they're bouncing off the walls.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The universe will
connect the dots for you.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And realize that the only way--
my gosh, Lilu-- that you're

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.520 align:middle line:84%
going to be that crazy happy
that you're just bouncing off

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
the walls is if you've
got work you love,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.800 align:middle line:84%
if you've got enough money
to live life on your terms

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
as you define it,
however you want it,

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:84%
if you've got health, if
you've got a place to go,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:84%
if you've got friends
to laugh with.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that is
now being coordinated

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:84%
because of the end
result of happiness

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:90%
that you've programmed.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot be
technically happy and broke,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
happy and-- when you put words
to truth, they always slip.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So you can be happy
even if you don't

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.470 align:middle line:90%
even have a shirt on your back.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But to be woo woo happy in
this Western world and much

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of the world where there's been
such advancement economically

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and otherwise, you can have
happiness with abundance.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It would be almost impossible
in the United States

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
to be rocking, woo woo happy
as you and I would define it

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and be broke.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that you'd be tested

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:90%
or given that opportunity.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're putting that
kind of joy out there,

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have money.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.120 align:middle line:90%
It's going to come to you.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.850 align:middle line:90%
You'll find a way.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:90%
You'll have an idea.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.280 align:middle line:90%
It might not be tomorrow.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It might be next month.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But when dreams come
true, they always

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:84%
are better than you
thought they'd be,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and it always happened
faster than you

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:90%
thought they would happen.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And with my life
today, I look back

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think-- it's 12
years since the last really

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:90%
low point.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:84%
If somebody had told me it would
be years before I was doing

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:84%
a world tour, years before I saw
light at the end of the tunnel,

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.610 align:middle line:90%
I would have been devastated.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I would have said,
what about the magic?

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
But now, 12 years later and
for many, many, many years

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:84%
living the life of
my dreams, there'd

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:84%
be no price too high to pay
for this kind of a life.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I would of waited 12, I
would have waited 24 years.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I would wait anything so
that in my last breath,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I could have lived a little
bit like I'm now living.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.376 align:middle line:84%
And then you think,
oh, that was fast.

00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:90%
How about the emotion part?

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us about that?

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
there's different levels.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Even when I hear you
bouncing off the wall,

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel that now-- I feel
it's more about really

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:90%
feeling it in the heart.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
we get overexcited,

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and then it's not exactly that
same really deep vibration

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that will go straight
to that heart desire

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:90%
that is so pure, so real.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:84%
That's so, so powerful, which
is another reason automatically

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that happiness is such
a force for change--

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:84%
positive, wonderful change,
because it triggers emotion.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:90%
It is an emotion.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Emotion is the turbocharger
of manifestation.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Emotion is-- that might
sound kind of silly,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.170 align:middle line:84%
but it makes manifestations
happen faster.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If you want that and
you want, woo hoo,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that, you're going to get this
a lot faster if you can feel it.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.161 align:middle line:84%
And again, people
get tripped up,

00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
because they think
they have to figure out

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:90%
how they're going to feel that.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
figure out how you're

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:01.670 align:middle line:90%
going to be woo woo happy.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:84%
You just do that happy dance
every morning for five minutes,

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.860 align:middle line:84%
three minutes, four
minutes, and do your best,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.410 align:middle line:84%
even if you feel
totally doubtful

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and insecure and
perplexed, just to show

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.551 align:middle line:84%
up in some direction that
might be the right direction.

00:29:16.551 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The universe grabs the
baton and takes you there.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Emotion bypasses
the cursed house.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Emotion automatically
takes our mind off

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:90%
of how am I going to get there.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.946 align:middle line:84%
It puts you to that place
of I'm there, I'm there,

00:29:31.946 --> 00:29:33.347 align:middle line:84%
I'm there even though
you didn't know how

00:29:33.347 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:90%
you were going to get there.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.620 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to
know how you got

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:90%
there so long as you showed up.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll share with you a
question that viewers

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:90%
might be thinking now.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:90%
It comes up often.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I tell people never worry or
mess with the cursed hows,

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.760 align:middle line:84%
meaning don't worry about how
your dream will come true.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Brain is too small.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Can't do it.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Divine intelligence
handles that.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I also say repeatedly-- I've
already said-- every day,

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself what else
can I do and do it,

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
seemingly futile it is.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Take action.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.190 align:middle line:84%
As others phrase it,
take massive action.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean
work your fingers

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to the bone or work overtime.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:84%
This means during the time
that's allotted, be there.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Be your best.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Shine.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So how do you not mess
with the cursed hows, yet

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.310 align:middle line:84%
every single day, show up, show
up, be there, knock on doors,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:90%
turn over stones?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The thing that makes a
cursed how a cursed how

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:90%
is not what you do.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It's how you view what you do.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:84%
It's how or why you
view yourself doing it.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
go down this path,

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.180 align:middle line:84%
write that book because it's
going to be a bestseller,

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Oprah is going to
fall in love with it,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:84%
you will rock the world,
live in abundance-- oh man,

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:90%
that is totally cursed hows.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.001 align:middle line:84%
But if, on the other
hand-- same thing--

00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to write that book
because you feel like you've

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:84%
got something to say,
and hey, maybe the sales

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
will be caught by the
unfailing wins of the universe,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but you're also going to go
to this networking meeting,

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're also going to
join Toastmasters to get over

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.470 align:middle line:84%
your fear of speaking-- that's
what I did-- you're also going

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:84%
to dabble with
internet marketing,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.460 align:middle line:84%
you're also going to go out
and take a microphone with you

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.180 align:middle line:84%
wherever you go, you're also
going to go out and join leads

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
groups and network-- now
you're writing a book

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing this
and you're doing that,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:84%
all of which would be led
by your own inner barometer,

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.970 align:middle line:90%
your inner feelings.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying do everything.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying do the least sucky.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're in a place where
you have some preferences,

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.770 align:middle line:90%
do those preferences.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Do what you can with
what you've got.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And don't view any one of them
as how my dream will come true.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, it turns
into a cursed how.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.930 align:middle line:84%
View it as, this
might be the way.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Let me give it
1,000%, let me give

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.311 align:middle line:84%
it my all while simultaneously
giving these other things my

00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:46.010 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.111 align:middle line:84%
I pursued writing-- just
Notes From the Universe,

00:31:49.111 --> 00:31:51.860 align:middle line:84%
little emails.
A book was too overwhelming.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I pursued audio programs.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I pursued internet marketing,
viral marketing, all

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.580 align:middle line:90%
that jazz, affiliate marketing.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I pursued the
Toastmasters speaking

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and some other things
that never really went

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:90%
anywhere all at the same time.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.700 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to pick one.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
If you have something
that you're absolutely

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in love with-- you're a dancer,
and by teaching dancing,

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
you can afford to do
dancing exclusively.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Or for any other reason, you
can afford to do it exclusively,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:84%
then you can just stay
you where your heart

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
is because you love it and
because you can afford it.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't yet
know what you love,

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:84%
or you know what you
love, but you can't yet

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:84%
afford to do it exclusively--
knock on other doors,

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
diversify within the same
realm-- dance studios,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:90%
dance education.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Put together a troop.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Knock on all these doors within
the dance or entertainment

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
realm so that not one of them
has to be your saving grace.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:44.810 align:middle line:90%
It's too much pressure.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You end up carrying the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:90%
So what's the focus, then?

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
It's how I feel, how
good all this feels,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.610 align:middle line:90%
it's following the intuition?

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:53.360 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:90%
All of those things.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.950 align:middle line:84%
For me, the number
one focus ought

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to be what general
area-- keep it

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:84%
general at this stage--
what general area do

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:04.690 align:middle line:90%
you most want to see change in.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't say the general
area of my life

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that I'd like to see
changing in is my painting.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not general.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your creativity.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your vocation.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:90%
That's general.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Is it your vocation?

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Is it health?

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it relationships?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.610 align:middle line:90%
You get to decide.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:25.690 align:middle line:84%
There's any number of big
picture, big category items.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Now you've got direction.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You've got guidance.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got the
general basket named

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
as your high priority for
change, then, as you just said,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
you tune in.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You ask yourself,
of the things that I

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:84%
could do in this direction,
what appeals to me most?

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.710 align:middle line:90%
What makes sense?

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Please weigh in intellect.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Too many new-to-spiritual
people, newly spiritual people,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
are all about throw out logic
and just live by your heart.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.810 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's crazy.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:90%
We have a mind for a reason.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It assesses what is
pleasing to us, what

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:90%
is a great compliment to us.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a great tool.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
True, it's wildly overrated
in our primitive times-- logic

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and the intellect, wildly.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
use it because it

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:90%
knows how to get there.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
how to get there.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, if
something doesn't

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
intellectually feel right,
it's not that it's impossible.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:90%
All things are possible.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But it could be you've
stubbed your toe

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.199 align:middle line:90%
on an invisible limiting belief.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you ignore it, this
intellectual hesitancy, then

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
you're ignoring this block,
and you're going to be bounding

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.550 align:middle line:90%
your head against the wall.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:84%
Either figure out what the
invisible limiting belief is--

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but that's a tall task,
and I don't recommend it,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a workaround--
or slightly

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:90%
change your perspectives.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Knock on this door next to it.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.699 align:middle line:90%
Knock on the agency door.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:53.702 align:middle line:90%
Knock on the lawyer door.

00:34:53.702 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
In the same genre,
knock on different doors

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:90%
until it does make sense.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And then with your heart
and your mind in unison

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to the best of your
ability-- even though there

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
will be lot of doubt if you're
just starting out from a crash

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and burn like I
was 12 years ago--

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:90%
at least now you're rolling.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And one day will
lead to another.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And in seven days, you'll see
things you couldn't see today.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:84%
In seven months,
you'll see things

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't have seen then.

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And because you're rolling,
the scenery will change.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:90%
You'll have a new best friend.

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a new epiphany, and
the miracles will be unfurled.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't have that
drive, the energy is not there,

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and you-- because it can be
daunting when you don't have--

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Very daunting in
these primitive times.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have the drive,
I would say it's probably

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.810 align:middle line:84%
because you're not yet
on that place of truth

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
where you're realizing your
inclination to succeed.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So immerse yourself
in more truth.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
It's also quite
possible that some

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
I talk about-- I'm

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:90%
always talking about abundance.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm always talking about
traveling internationally.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my passions.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But if that doesn't
resonate with you

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to make
it resonate with you,

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:90%
what does resonate with you?

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And give yourself a timeout
if you need to discern that.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Just don't be
timed out too long.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd say fake it until you
make it or go to that job

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
you hate is better
than doing nothing.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Better than doing nothing.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't mean you
stay there forever,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.840 align:middle line:84%
but you need to be
mixing with life,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, you'll
lose your footing.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's harder and
harder every year

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:24.250 align:middle line:90%
that goes by to join the dance.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:90%
So just do anything.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.760 align:middle line:90%
It's better than nothing.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you're doing
it, immersed in truth,

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:84%
reminded constantly of your
divine power, your inclination

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to succeed, that
you're never alone,

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're supernatural--
you will find that path.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:84%
When I started out
writing emails and joining

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Toastmasters, I really
didn't like either,

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and there was no light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:45.260 align:middle line:90%
I hated speaking.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I shook like a leaf
on a tree in front o

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
12 strangers giving
my ice breaker.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.990 align:middle line:84%
The Notes From the Universe were
kind of fun in the beginning.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I like the creativity.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:90%
But there was no money.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:55.960 align:middle line:90%
They're still free.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:90%
It was like, what am I doing?

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I was always feeling
this resistance.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But I would still ask
myself what else could

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I do, how else
could I try it, what

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
are other people doing with this
new thing called the internet.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I could send out a daily email.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I could network.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I could learn about
affiliate marketing.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And I asked for help.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:90%
I asked for help.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.660 align:middle line:90%
Let that be a door you knock on.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I asked Toastmasters for help.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.590 align:middle line:90%
I asked entrepreneurs for help.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
I asked neighbors for help.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a big deal for a
man to ask for help, maybe

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:90%
even more so than a woman.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.180 align:middle line:84%
That's funny, because
I know a lot of women

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.290 align:middle line:84%
who have trouble
asking for help,

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.820 align:middle line:90%
particularly women in a career.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They think that it's not
right or it's not done.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, male or
female, you're nuts

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
if you don't ask for
help, because everyone

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:90%
wants to help you.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Some will be too
busy, and that's OK.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Nine out of 10 will give
you more information--

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:84%
too much information
in many cases--

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:84%
than you even ever hoped
that they would give you.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I asked a professional
speaker for help.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I was at Toastmasters
scared of my own shadow,

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and I went to
these NSA meetings,

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.790 align:middle line:84%
National Speakers Association
meetings, as a paying guest.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And I approached the president
of the Central Florida chapter,

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and I said, hey,
you live in Orlando.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I live in Orlando.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.404 align:middle line:90%
And you're speaking.

00:38:18.404 --> 00:38:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to speak one day.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Could I just ask you some
questions about how you got

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
started, how you dealt
with the fear, how

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.990 align:middle line:90%
you dealt with the nerves?

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I never wrote myself
off, because I

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:90%
was totally petrified.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It made sense to
me intellectually

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:84%
to knock on the
door of speaking,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I
had something to say.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, this guy was
the one who ended up suggesting

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I create an audio
program with him--

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the president of the
NSA Central Florida--

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up titling
Infinite Possibilities.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
He bailed out before the
first recording was done.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But by then, man, I was
like-- I had a path.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I had no path until I asked
this guy for help on speaking,

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me help
on something else.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is so typical.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
When you take
action, you're going

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:90%
to knock on these three doors.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And because you knocked on
those three doors, all of which

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
were duds, door 95 opens up,
or 95 through 100 open up,

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.740 align:middle line:84%
or 7 through 10 open up,
and you're like, holy cow,

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:90%
where did that come from?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Those doors would
not have opened

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
if you were at home waiting for
an epiphany and a green light.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Go do stuff now, and never stop.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Today I live the
life of my dreams.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Every day I ask myself,
what else could I try?

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:90%
How else could I approach this?

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Where else could I go?

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.900 align:middle line:84%
How could I repackage
what I'm doing?

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:90%
I view myself now as a teacher.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I love teaching the
nature of reality.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessed, happy,
fortunate, whatever--

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and I take some credit for it,
because this is what I teach--

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:84%
we create our own reality--
to have people who

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:90%
want to hear what I'm teaching.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So my questions center
around how can I reach more,

00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:84%
how can I make it more fun for
those who I'm already reaching?

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Notes From the Universe-- who
could have-- if I had ever

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.660 align:middle line:84%
thought of that when I
was at my lowest of lows,

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I would have thought, that is
the stupidest, most arrogant,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.830 align:middle line:90%
conceited, blockhead idea.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't wait
for the epiphany

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:90%
that I would have shot down.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I just started writing as Mike.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And then writing as Mike
for eight months, first

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:84%
weekly, then daily, and
having fun with it--

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
although plenty of people
unsubscribed every day--

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I had this idea right from
the universe's perspective,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.140 align:middle line:90%
because you could say more.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And it would come
from a higher Place.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'd have more of a pow
to the reader, the punchline.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I wrote the first one,
capitulating to this idea that

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
came from heart and mind, I saw
that there was room for humor.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
If Mike-- who knows Mike--
says, by the way, you rock,

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:90%
it's like, who are you, dude?

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:84%
But if the universe
punctuates his or her

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:84%
or its email with, by the way,
you rock, it's like, oh yeah.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:90%
That's where I live.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm talking about.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the divine intelligence
that we are immersed in.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw there
was room for humor.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I could not have gotten
to that point had

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.254 align:middle line:90%
I not written as the universe.

00:41:06.254 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I could not have
written as the universe

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.660 align:middle line:84%
if I had not written
for a eight long months

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.010 align:middle line:84%
as Mike, which was
never as much fun

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.360 align:middle line:84%
ever as popular as the
universe writings came to be.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But that evidences, if you
will, the metamorphosis

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that a life and a
journey and an adventure

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:84%
takes on, guiding you to places
you never could have dreamed

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of going and you never
would have gone if you

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't just start scared,
alone, in the dark,

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:90%
down some sucky path.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.970 align:middle line:84%
You brought up an
important point, too-- when

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.840 align:middle line:84%
we start going in a direction
and then there's a person that

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:84%
says yes, and then this
person doesn't show up

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.860 align:middle line:84%
or we end up not doing
it with that person,

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
but then there's something
else that shows up,

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
but it put us where
we need to be.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we
have a way of saying,

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:84%
no, but this is this
person, and then

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:84%
we give up that whole
project altogether when this

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:90%
was just a way to get there.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
The Juicy Living Tour,
many things that I've done,

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:84%
it was originally
for the OWN Network.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work out.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.260 align:middle line:90%
But then I was the concept.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.200 align:middle line:90%
The idea was there.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And off I go.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it on my own.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was instead of being
the victim and saying,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, they didn't
support me and this.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:84%
There's something else
even greater than that.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:90%
So awesome.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I teach.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy if you
just keep showing up

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and you don't draw conclusions
with your physical senses,

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.260 align:middle line:90%
because they lie.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.240 align:middle line:84%
They see nothing of the
miracles that are whirling

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.610 align:middle line:90%
all around you right now.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Rhonda Byrne's
dream for The Secret

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that got me and everyone
else so excited was it

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:84%
would be the first
documentary program

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that was to air
on every major TV

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:84%
station on this entire
planet the same day.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.410 align:middle line:90%
They went to Cannes.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.220 align:middle line:84%
They went to markets
all over the planet.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:84%
They had this
magnificent project.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They were getting people ready
for it before it was even done.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And every network-- this
was the dream-- on Earth

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.937 align:middle line:84%
was going to air
it on the same day.

00:42:57.937 --> 00:42:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
what it would have

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.760 align:middle line:90%
been like if that had happened?

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Not one network on the planet--
not even her investor--

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Channel 3 in
Australia-- said this is cool,

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:90%
this is good.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.590 align:middle line:90%
They said no.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Everyone said no.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine--
she had told me.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.090 align:middle line:84%
She had told everyone in The
Secret and the 200 other people

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.950 align:middle line:84%
they interviewed-- everyone
knew that this was the dream.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:90%
This was a done deal.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
We were so sure it
was a done deal.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Rhonda was electrifying with
her enthusiasm and passion

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.360 align:middle line:84%
towards the end result.
Her end result--

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.340 align:middle line:90%
bringing joy to billions.

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I remember that the morning
I met her in Chicago--

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.880 align:middle line:90%
bringing joy to billions.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty out
there, up there,

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
big number, pretty
bodacious, if you will.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And when they all said no,
she turned to the people who

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:84%
were in The Secret
and said, things

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.610 align:middle line:90%
aren't going quite as planned.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But would you announce it
to your respective list?

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.260 align:middle line:84%
By then, I had--
back then, it was,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.530 align:middle line:84%
I think, only 70,000
people on my mailing list,

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.890 align:middle line:90%
but it was a core group.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And all of the other teachers
had thousands on their list.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And it picked up just as well.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what would
have happened if it had

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.530 align:middle line:84%
been every major
network, but it was

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:90%
like spontaneous combustion.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Way before Oprah got it,
way before Larry King

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
did two shows, way before
Ellen, way before-- it

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:90%
was already on fire.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the distributors.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no factory that
could keep up with the demand.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It was no advertising other
than the word of mouth

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:90%
from the people who were in it.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
beautiful things where

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
the desire for truth in
the world was so great,

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and the presentation that was
put together in The Secret

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
was so ideally
suited to the masses

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.720 align:middle line:84%
who wanted truth
that it was like,

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.570 align:middle line:90%
bam, spontaneous illumination.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Dots were connected,
and it took off,

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and all the others
came on board.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But what you said, though,
speaks to exactly that.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And if I could
synthesize it down to not

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.860 align:middle line:84%
attaching-- I was talking
about the curse of hows--

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.970 align:middle line:90%
don't attach to a how.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Be open for even better,
which you might not

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
know what better is, so
go with what you've got,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:90%
but be open for better.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I also teach don't ever
attach to a specific person

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:90%
behaving in a specific way.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's your spouse
or your hope-to-be spouse,

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.890 align:middle line:90%
you can't control them.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:84%
You're setting yourself
up for absolute heartbreak

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and ultimate failure as
humans define failure

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
if you're attaching
your happiness

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
or expectations on the
behavior and judgment

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.180 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts of someone else.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They are untouchable,
and I am untouchable,

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.530 align:middle line:90%
and you are untouchable.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And this was what we
agreed to coming here.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We're like, OK, I'll
do time and space time.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Planet Earth looks really cool.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But no one is going
to manipulate me.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.860 align:middle line:90%
No one is giong to own me.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:90%
No one is going to own you, OK.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And so these people that
you'd like to pin down,

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:90%
they entered the same agreement.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.930 align:middle line:84%
No one can be directed
or manipulated,

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.760 align:middle line:90%
and this saves all of us.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, do not attach
to unimportant details,

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.720 align:middle line:90%
and all details are unimportant.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:90%
This is what my matrix teaches.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Visualize the details.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.860 align:middle line:84%
Get excited about the
bling or whatever it is,

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.070 align:middle line:90%
holding hands with someone.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Visualize even specific
people, but leave

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.910 align:middle line:90%
the door open for even better.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And by not attaching-- which is
what you just said with the OWN

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Network and all the great
work you're doing now Gaiam,

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and what I did when my path
didn't unfold the way I thought

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.410 align:middle line:84%
it would, and all of the
other success stories--

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:90%
there was not that attachment.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And people have been taught-- or
they misunderstood the secret.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.204 align:middle line:84%
The universe loves you,
and it'll make it happen,

00:46:38.204 --> 00:46:39.269 align:middle line:90%
and there's a law of attraction.

00:46:39.269 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's as predictable as gravity.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make Trixie
fall in love with me,

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and my book will be a
bestseller, because all things

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.169 align:middle line:90%
are possible.

00:46:44.169 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ah, there's these
nuances that are all important.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't mess with the hows.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't insist on a
specific person,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and don't attach to
unimportant details

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that are all unimportant, and
then the world is your oyster.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.609 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful.
How juicy.

00:46:57.609 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Very, very delicious
conversation.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Mike, for all these
wonderful thoughts, food.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.320 align:middle line:90%
This is rich.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:90%
This is abundant.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.200 align:middle line:90%
This is so what I love.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I am so happy.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy our
paths have crossed.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much, Lilou.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.390 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, we wish you
amazing, amazing

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.590 align:middle line:84%
co-creations here to you
guys, wherever you live,

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:18.455 align:middle line:90%
wherever you are.

00:47:18.455 --> 00:47:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Many, many blessings.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Your few books name-- we
didn't really talk about them,

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.840 align:middle line:90%
but just a few titles?

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Tut.com, my website.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:90%
T-U-T dot com.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It's leveraging the
universe, engaging

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.760 align:middle line:90%
the magic, world tours.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll cross paths when
the time is right.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Much love.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.
