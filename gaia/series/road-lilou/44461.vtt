00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road in
London in England.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Very, very special people here.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that you spent
quite some time in Majorca,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:84%
but you're British too,
originally, aren't you Serge?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.183 align:middle line:84%
>> SERGE OBOLENSKY
BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm British, but I have a German
father and a Russian mother.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:90%
She came over at the revolution.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a mongrel a mongrel,
and I like mongrels.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.975 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mixture of everything.

00:00:40.975 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to have this
conversation with you,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's probably one of
my favorite topics, the heart.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of
"Awakening the Universal

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
Heart, a Guide to
Spiritual Activism."

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to speak
of spirituality, activism,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.675 align:middle line:84%
healing, opening the heart,
living fully in the heart.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, isn't that
the most important thing

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.724 align:middle line:84%
to not even think of
but be in these days?

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well,
I guess we've got to be

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
in the heart.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I think to be
an activist, Lilou,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
we've got to feel things deeply.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:84%
We've got to feel the
pain of the planet.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
We've got to care about what
happens to people the other end

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
of the world whom we don't know.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've just seen
with Nelson Mandela what

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is the most remarkable
thing about him

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
is that he was totally
a man of the heart.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that he
embodies the courage

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, the wisdom
of the heart, the love,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and the forgiveness.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And this guy forgave
the white people.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
He forgave his prisoners.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
gentleness and goodness.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this man sums
up the power of the heart,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that all the great
men in history who've

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
made a difference-- and
interesting so many of them

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
have been black,
Martin Luther King--

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
they've been men
and women of heart.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%
So we need heart in the world.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that too many of us

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
only live up here in our minds.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:90%
We think things out.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:90%
We're rational.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We rationalize.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:90%
We make everything abstract.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We know about what
is wrong with what

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
is happening on the planet,
but we don't live with heart,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
so we live as part of
the problems of the world

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:90%
not part of the solutions.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Because only with heart are
we going to put ourselves out

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because as long
as we're in fear mode,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:84%
we are thinking of
our own little selves,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and we can't really be spiritual
activist or take decisions

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or even have the creativity
to really be there and help.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that the problem
in the world, Lilou,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
is the level of consciousness,
is that what differentiates

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:84%
us is not that you're
French and I'm English,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
or if you were black and I
was white, or you were rich

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and I am poor.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What differentiates us is
levels of consciousness.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can have men who
are very, very clever,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.150 align:middle line:84%
they have two PhDs, but at a
morality level, at a goodness

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
level, at an ethical level,
the intelligence is very low.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So these men may be in high
positions in the world,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:84%
but they're going to abuse power
because they haven't awoken

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:90%
the intelligence of the heart.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because inside our
hearts is a brain.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we can link our
heads and our hearts,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.560 align:middle line:84%
then we are in
touch with a wisdom

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
where we're connected
with a sort of larger

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.132 align:middle line:84%
picture of what's
happening in the world.

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us more about
that intelligence of the heart.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
And how can that be awakened?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
What are the different
steps that you have seen?

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well,
I teach spiritual retreats

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:90%
to help awaken it.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I work with businesses to help
awaken the corporate heart,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:90%
very important in business.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
If a CEO has a
compassionate heart,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
he can make a hell of
a lot of difference

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
because he has millions
and millions of pounds

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
at his disposal.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the intelligence
of the heart

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.633 align:middle line:84%
is really a sense of being
part of the flow of evolution.

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Just before this
interview started,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
we were both saying that the
only thing that we can do

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is what we need to do is
what our hearts tell us,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.640 align:middle line:90%
to follow our heart.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is the intelligence.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:84%
If we listen to
our hearts, we know

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
how to do things
in the right way.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
If I listen to my heart, I
know how to relate to you.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
As you listen to your heart,
Lilou, you sense me out.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Your heart comes out towards
me, and you sense me,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and we both sort of tune
into each other's vibrations.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
So there's always a meeting.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I meet
people of heart, I

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:90%
may never have met them before.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
They may be a completely
different race or religion

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
or culture, but we
share the common ground

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's the recognition
of each other's humanity.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was just at
Kuala Lumpur Airport

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
going to see my
daughter in New Zealand.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to a man
who was from at the foot

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.425 align:middle line:90%
of the Himalayas, in that part.

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:90%
It'll come.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And after one minute, we
spoke the same language,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and we just loved each
other, because there

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
was a kind of connection
that we knew each other.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was speaking to a
part of myself and he to me.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And we'd just met
at the airport.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
intelligence of the heart

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.740 align:middle line:84%
is that we experience that
part of ourselves, Lilou,

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:90%
that is universal.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:90%
So examples of this happening--

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's like one heart,
one heart for all of us that

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:90%
were connected to.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the time
of that first big tsunami?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
This crisis awoke people.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And even poor people in
the streets in England

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
who were street people were
giving what little money

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
they had to feed their brothers
and sisters at the other end

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:84%
of the world who'd been
devastated by that tidal wave.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So when the heart
awakens, it doesn't

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
matter what religion we
are, what class we are.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But we find a caring for
our fellow human beings,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:90%
even if we've never met them.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And so if we care, we
want to do something.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And most people only care
for their own family,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
so their heart is restricted
to a personal level.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, I've got to look
after my family, my children.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:90%
That is good.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
We need to have
heart for our family.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But we need to have heart
for the larger human family,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.715 align:middle line:84%
because we're part
of a bigger family.

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And we have
the capacity to do so.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
And we have the capacity.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But we've got to
awaken that capacity.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And that capacity does
not happen naturally.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Like a tree from a seed,
it grows into an oak tree.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:90%
We become a human being.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
be fully human,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
we have to work at
awakening that capacity.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose my life has
been devoted to helping people

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
in businesses, my clients
in psychotherapy, people who

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
come to my groups
to awaken the heart.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
And we need to do things.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:90%
We need to work at it.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are used
to only going out

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
to work to earn
our outer living.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But I say we need to
earn our inner living.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:90%
We need to go into work.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:90%
There's another kind of work.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's working to
develop ourselves.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It's working to heal
the wounds of the heart.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.909 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us
come in with wounds.

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Do we really come in?

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Or as we grow up that's
when the wounds come in?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.705 align:middle line:84%
Or do we already have
those wounds when

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:90%
we come into our bodies?

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well, I
feel there's all sources that

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:90%
we come in.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained as a
past life therapist.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not one believes in
past lives, it doesn't matter.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Because you just interviewed
Rupert Sheldrake, and he

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
has his morphic genetic
theory that we're all

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:90%
sort of connected.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:05.400 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I feel that the
heart of humanity is wounded.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we're part
of humanity, we

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
come in with a species
wounding as well as

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:90%
with our own personal wounds.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So you and I, Lilou, we both
hold the wounds of humanity.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
interesting experience

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
at the time of
Princess Diana's death.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
My mother had just died
earlier, and she looked a little

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.340 align:middle line:90%
like her when she was young.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And she was also a princess,
so there was a connection there

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:90%
that was interesting.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I got caught into that whole
Diana thing of sort of mourning

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:90%
for Princess Diana.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Then I got into mourning
my mother's death.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I suddenly felt myself
taking on the pain of women.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.425 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this is
weird, because I'm a man.

00:11:06.425 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But then I thought a lot of my
clients in therapy are women.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, I was suddenly
feeling the pain of women who'd

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
been abused and raped
and murdered and taken

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
as second class citizens, and
I went into this painful place.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And I realized this
is not my stuff.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
This is something
bigger than me.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going through this?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I asked my heart, look, why
am I going through this pain?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And my heart said,
look, this is part

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of your bequeathment
in this life.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do some healing
for the feminine heart,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
because as a man you hold
a male and a female part.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So I allowed this
grieving for womankind,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of
lasted about a week.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it,
I felt so liberated,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
as if in doing some
grieving and healing

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
for the collective
female wounded heart

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.485 align:middle line:84%
I'd also done something
to heal my own heart.

00:12:18.485 --> 00:12:21.506 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.963 align:middle line:90%
That is so powerful.

00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
feel sometimes limited.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back
to our beingness

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and us being human being.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And where do we take it
from us to the world?

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
so big and so huge.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's like some people
are trying to get out of

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and were trying to get
out of those human schemas

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and those human wounds already.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, oh
my god, not only

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:84%
do we need to take
our own wounds

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
but all the wounds
of the planet.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that quicker?

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:90%
How can we take that on?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.891 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean by taking that
on we're going to heal our own?

00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Well, I always think that

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a connection between
the part and the whole,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that every part
contains the whole,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and the whole is made
up of many parts.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment
we are connected.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So if something
goes on between us,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
who knows if it's your
wound or my wound?

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So at the one hand,
the world of the heart

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:90%
is a world of mystery.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But at the other
hand, it's a world

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
that, if we open to
our hearts, our hearts

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
have the great capacity to
heal even if they're wounded.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think we all come
in with a wounded heart.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And it may be past incarnations.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
We may have had a
difficult birth.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It may be we're holding the
wounds of our ancestors.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I've had to work through quite
a lot of ancestral trauma.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
My mother was born in
the Russian Revolution,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and she escaped the revolution,
and they lost everything.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And my grandparents escaped,
and there was trauma.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I felt I'd inherited
that trauma.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
My father was in the first
World War and was blown up,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and his twin was blown
up in front of him.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I felt I inherited
these traumas.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And my parents didn't
know how to resolve them,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:90%
so I had to work them through.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that there's
lots of wounding.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I think why
it's so difficult to make

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
things work in the world
is because we're always

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
bumping up against
our old wounds.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have to heal
these wounds before we

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:90%
can go on and move forward.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And what is so
interesting, I think

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in the
world at the moment, Lilou,

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:90%
is it's so transparent.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:90%
The wounds are coming up.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
You can't hide the
dishonesty of politicians,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
the dishonesty of banks, selling
us products that we don't need,

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
the dishonestly
of the dictators,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
the dishonesty of the foreign
policy of kind of backing

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
dictators and thinking that
it'll get rid of terrorism.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:84%
All these evils and
dishonesties are coming up

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
so we can see them
and deal with them,

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and the place that we deal
with them is inside our hearts.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're challenged
to take the pain of the world

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:84%
into our hearts,
Lilou, so then we

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:90%
can move it up and transform it.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: How do we do that?

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Well, the heart knows.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but I think -- I
wrote in my book the heart is

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:90%
our inner alchemist.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:90%
The heart knows how to heal.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The heart knows how
to resolve conflicts.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The heart knows how to
bring darkness into light.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The heart knows how to
bring love or courage in.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And the heart has
its own wisdom.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart, I
suppose, is that place where

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:84%
the divine lives,
where god lives.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is another
word, if you like, for god.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But one doesn't want to be too
religious, because then one

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
gets sort of caught up
in, well, I believe this,

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:90%
or I believe that.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But the heart, as the
great Pierre Teilhard de

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Chardin said, there's more
power inside the awakened heart

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:84%
than inside the atomic bomb,
and that's a profound remark.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
So here's this inner
weapon, and this book

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is about how we can use this
inner weapon and awaken it.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And only then can we
truly be an activist,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
because we're in touch
with our greatest weapon.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the weapon
of healing and doing

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:90%
good and goodness in the world.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.865 align:middle line:84%
I call it our greatest
weapon of self-construction.

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We hear a lot of
the Ho'oponopono and the

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness and
forgiving another person,

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
forgiving knowing that we're
all interconnected, forgiving.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the
work that is here to do?

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: I've got
a chapter in the book called

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
"Awakening the Heart
of Forgiveness."

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
got to forgive.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult,
because our egos don't want to.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So if we've been
in a relationship

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and you left me and
I'm angry, that anger's

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
going to sort of go on there.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always going to
feel frustrated and unhappy,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be projecting
negative energy onto you.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So neither of us will be able
to get on with our lives.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So the only way of healing that
is I have to let go and forgive

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and open up that space and
take you into my heart,

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
forgiveness is.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:90%
We have to forgive our enemies.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what, again, what
Nelson Mandela showed us.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And if he can forgive
those prisoners...

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
those people who
jailed him-- I think

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
it was 27 years in
prison-- then it just

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:90%
shows us what we need to do.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that unless
forgiveness happens

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
between the Israelis
and the Palestinians

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
or between the
Serbs and the Croats

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
or between all these tribes,
there will always be fighting.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
turmoil in the world

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:84%
is old tribal memories
of hatred and anger.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a little theory that
a lot of the reason why

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
the Muslims are so angry with us
is because maybe-- this is just

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:90%
sort of maybe.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:08.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it is--
because maybe they were --

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
we have reincarnated as the
Christians in the Crusades who

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
killed all those Muslims in the
Crusades in the name of Christ.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So they're wanting to blow
us up in return because it's

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
an unresolved trauma
that continues

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:90%
in the species' wounded heart.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: For people
like Caroline Myss,

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:84%
it's the same old, same old,
and we're not really evolving,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and nothing is really changing.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I love her brutal honesty on
how she, personally, that's

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
how she sees it.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And though she brings
elements and components

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
of the human spirit and
how we can-- but for her,

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:90%
nothing has really changed.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you think?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of other
people on this planet

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
say, no, no, things
are really changing.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Where are we at right
now with all this?

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And how can it really
change this time

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to really bring back
a love revolution

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
or a spiritual
activist revolution

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
in this world that will
totally transform this planet?

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Well, I think, Lilou,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that there are many incredible
people whom we don't know

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:84%
of who work behind the lines
in every country, brave,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, committed souls who
are doing incredible things

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in their country who are not
reported because they're not

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.345 align:middle line:84%
glamorous or famous,
they're not Bono or--

00:21:53.345 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Mother Teresa.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.256 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:21:58.256 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:90%
They're not the superstars.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel that,
underneath the surface,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
an incredible amount
of goodness is going on

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and that things are
changing, but we're not

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:90%
seeing the effects.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:84%
What I find interesting
is that we always

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
have two prophecies going
on at the same time.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
One prophecy is it's
all going to be fine.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into
a golden new age,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and all the evil is
going to dissolve,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and it'll be wonderful.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We'll wake up,
and love and peace

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
will be restored on the planet.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And the others say,
no, it's getting worse.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We've gone past the
point of no return.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no hope.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's give up.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's good that
we have these two balances.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if we only
believed, well,

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
it's all, sort of,
wonderful, we'd all sit back,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and we wouldn't do anything.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we only believed that
it was at the end of everything

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and the human experiment
was going to give in

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and we'd all die,
then we'd give up.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to sort
of have people

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
who have a positive
message and those

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:90%
who have a negative message.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what my
message in my book

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:84%
is I feel that
only through crisis

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.470 align:middle line:90%
are we really going to wake up.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual teacher
Gurdjieff said

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:84%
man is so unconscious that
unless he's touched by a crisis

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the
sum of his inertia,

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:90%
he's not going to wake up.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
If I look at my own life,
I've had a lot of crises,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and they've woken me up.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful,
because I think

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't have
made certain changes if I

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:90%
hadn't had crises.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's
the same with you,

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that what has brought
you into this world

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure is that you've had
crises and traumas and pain.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you've said,
well, I'm going

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and help
other people to wake up.

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that at some
point we may-- well,

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll put it like this.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the system is
totally dysfunctional,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and the system is what holds
everything together, the fact

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that three quarter of the
world is starving, that there's

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:49.705 align:middle line:84%
dictatorships, that there's
totalitarian regimes,

00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
there's corruption in
business and politics.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
That there's a battle
between the old system that

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
wants to stay as it is,
that it doesn't want to die,

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and the new world that
is trying to be born.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And there's the clash.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the clash
of civilizations,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
a new civilization that you
and I are trying to belong to

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and trying to create, you
with your wonderful work

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.420 align:middle line:90%
of interviewing people.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
old hardliners who

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
want the old order,
who don't want

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.861 align:middle line:84%
to give up their
power and influence.

00:25:31.861 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And they're in politics.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:90%
They're in business.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.586 align:middle line:90%
They're in the church.

00:25:38.586 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think at
some point there is

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be a crisis that
is going to involve us all.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that those of
us who are ready for it

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able
to ride this tidal wave

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and are going to move
into a new place.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who
still are trying

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto the old values
that are wanting to die

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and no longer
working, I think life

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
difficult for them.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we need to be
very flexible and very prepared

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:90%
for change.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's the
heart that will help us.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
On the way here,
I was driven here

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:84%
by this quite fanatical
Muslim taxi driver.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:90%
But he was a lovely man.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
how he had five children

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and he was so happy in his life.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want
more money, and he

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:90%
tried to do everything honestly.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
And I felt this is a happy man.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.340 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want more money.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
He's happy driving the taxi,
being gracious and kind

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to the people he
drove there, trying

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to instill his Islamic
beliefs into me.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.475 align:middle line:84%
And I was touched, and I felt
this is one of the new people.

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if our hearts
open, then we automatically

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.285 align:middle line:84%
become connected to the new
wave that is trying to be born.

00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:26.212 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.212 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So is it a matter of
when we're in those situations

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
or in life or when we encounter
a challenge or a problem

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
or a different perception or a
different perspective on life

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
or religious belief
or challenge,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
deep challenge or money
challenge or work challenge,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.675 align:middle line:84%
what do we do with the stuff
that comes up, the emotions,

00:27:50.675 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:90%
the wounds?

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Do we take it in our hearts?

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
What do you do, Lilou?

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put it back
to you for a second,

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll say.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU:
[GROWLING AND BABBLING] No.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I used to react really, really
like that, all over the place.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
passionate and French.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We have this thing about--
But this doesn't no longer

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:90%
serve me anymore.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering what
your perception--

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well,
life is about light and dark

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:36.820 align:middle line:84%
and good and evil
and pain and joy.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And pain and joy are very close.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And I guess in my life when
pain visits me in a crisis,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess while my old self
wants to fight it and blame

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
other people and say, oh,
well, it's this, and it's that,

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and if only this had
happened, at another level

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I need to take it into my
heart and breathe with it

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and sit with it and meditate.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I find that
my heart can give me

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.730 align:middle line:90%
a different perspective.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
I had a difficult situation
with a certain person

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:84%
over the last few years, and
initially I felt so outraged.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And then when I would
take it into my heart,

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I got the message this
person is your greatest guru.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:84%
They've come to teach
you forgiveness.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
They've come to teach you to
not respond at the level that

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
they're-- to try to respond
with kindness, so be grateful.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
I could see it from

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:90%
that different perspective.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.630 align:middle line:90%
It changed.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So now when they come into
my life in a difficult way,

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I say-- I don't say
it to them, but I

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:84%
say it to myself-- well,
thank you for being there.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I need to learn
patience and courage,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to try to make me
a slightly better human being.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the journey.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to become
better human beings or more

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:90%
fully human.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Jean Houston made a remark.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:84%
We're all born
Stradivariuses but brought up

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to believe, Lilou, that
we're plastic fiddles.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving up
being a plastic fiddle.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to move to a
new level of consciousness.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to open our hearts
and our minds to see the world

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and to be in the
world and to operate

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in the world in a new way.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
that we're an activist.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.514 align:middle line:90%
Andrew Harvey, who--

00:31:00.514 --> 00:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I had the delicious
pleasure to meet as well.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Yeah?

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.931 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Yes, through
Caroline, because their friends,

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:06.963 align:middle line:90%
Caroline Myss and him?

00:31:06.963 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.614 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: He speaks also
of spiritual activism.

00:31:10.614 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.220 align:middle line:90%
And he calls it sacred activism.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And he has this nice definition.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
He says the sacred activist is
the person whose heart burns

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:84%
with the desire to know
who they are and burns also

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with the flame of making
a difference in the world,

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
of trying to sort
of heal society.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so there's two
flames, the flames

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that we want to know
who we are and the flame

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of wanting to create
a better society.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.875 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of like
that definition.

00:31:48.875 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Because there's the balance,
then, between the person too.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, otherwise,
it feels sometimes

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be selfless
and we have to just purely

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
devote our life to the
challenges in the world.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But this is not what we're
called to do in this lifetime,

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to find
that right balance

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.280 align:middle line:84%
between honoring who
we are here on Earth

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and being here to help
and support others.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: And
if I'm unhappy in my life,

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
if my relationships don't
work, if I deprive myself,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I am going to operate out
of a space of emptiness.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be happy.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But if my personal
life can be full,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
then my impersonal
or transpersonal life

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:90%
has much more energy in it.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
art for all of us

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is to try to integrate
these two areas of our life,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:84%
our personal life, where
we want to do well and be

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.870 align:middle line:84%
successful and function and
have happiness in our life,

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and our impersonal life where
we want to make a difference.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can't sacrifice
the personal life,

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but we need to align
our personal life

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.600 align:middle line:90%
to our impersonal life.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I find
that my personal life,

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I have more fun if I'm
trying to make a difference.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I remember the moment
where my heart reopened and how

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.790 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden it felt like
light was coming in my body.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember opening my
arms, and it was here London

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
after a big suffering
of no more money.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:90%
It was like, [GASPS].

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was this opening
of the heart that happened.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.510 align:middle line:90%
Physically I could feel that.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's this light and
this kind of new paradigm

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.010 align:middle line:90%
that enters in, or even new air.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It feels like all our cells are
embedded with his new light.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:90%
What makes it happen?

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's like, how does this work?

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: But
so interesting, dear Lilou,

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that it had to be a crisis
that sort of did it.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the crisis allows us
to go deep into ourselves.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.724 align:middle line:84%
I remember in my
30s I had a crisis.

00:34:12.724 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
In my 30s, I was
living in California.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of weightlifting,
and I kind of sort of

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:31.570 align:middle line:84%
fancied myself as a real guy
and how many girls can Serge

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.360 align:middle line:90%
get and everything.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
space of one week

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
my best friend died, most
of the money I had got

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.370 align:middle line:84%
caught in something
and I lost it,

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
and I was diagnosed with a
life-threatening disease.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly I had
this suntanned body

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.139 align:middle line:84%
that I'd worked out
with big muscles

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to show off how great
I was to everyone.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:84%
One month later, I was
lying in hospital, thin

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
with tubes going into
me with no money.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
is going to happen?

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm so angry with the world.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And I went deeper and
deeper into a black hole

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.830 align:middle line:90%
of total emptiness, of despair.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no hope.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't have money.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, and my girlfriend
had also left me,

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and she found me too pompous
and too stuck-up and more

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
interested in developing
big muscles than being

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.990 align:middle line:90%
there for her.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I went into
this crisis, Lilou,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and it lasted about five months.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I came out of it,
and I was a changed person.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd got a little
bit of humility.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I saw my ego, and I
saw that all this thing

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:84%
of trying to push myself up
came out of my own insecurity.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So I had to journey
into my insecurity.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Why as a man am I trying
to have all these girls

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and have these big muscles?

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Because some part of me felt
small and inadequate and not

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:90%
good enough.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:23.852 align:middle line:84%
So I had to journey
into that pain.

00:36:23.852 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And fit in too,
fit into the society.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Because over in California,
that's very much the body.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.159 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe, it will
be different criteria.

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Well, this was

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s in California,
and it sort of was that era

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:45.430 align:middle line:84%
of, well, if I meet you and you
meet me and we like each other,

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:90%
well, let's get it off, man.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:90%
It was the gestalt prayer.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So I was very much part of
that narcissistic culture.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, these losses
at all these levels, Lilou,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:84%
was a great gain for
me as a human being.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of it a
sort of changed person.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It took six months,
but I had to go

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
through the
purification of fire.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the thing
that I think purifies us.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.300 align:middle line:90%
It is the purification of fire.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is that some of
the things that you use

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
in your retreats or
in your sessions?

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well, I
have some fire rituals in some

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of my retreats where people
go and they want to get rid

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:84%
of stuff in their life, like
a co-dependent relationship

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:90%
or a stone somewhere.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And they go out into
nature, and they

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:84%
gather a bundle of what
they'd like to let go of,

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and then they throw it into the
fire, and they watch it burn.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And then they dance the dance
of how they'd like to be.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So I use a lot of
rituals like that,

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because I trained as a
shaman a long time ago,

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and so I try to
bring that in, when

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I used to go around in feathers
and long hair and wear cloaks.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:24.562 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sort of just a
shaman in a jacket now.

00:38:24.562 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I love the
heart and the Earth on it.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Why did you choose to put that?

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Why is it the Earth
inside of this heart?

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Why is it maybe not
just a red heart?

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well,
because it's the universal

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:41.810 align:middle line:90%
heart.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the heart is
surrounding the Earth.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's why.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.956 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.956 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: How would you put
it, the universal heart, then?

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Where does it lie?

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.125 align:middle line:90%
Where is it sitting?

00:38:57.125 --> 00:38:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Well, it's everywhere,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and it's nowhere.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
It comes into being if we extend
our own hearts wide enough.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Then we give space for
the universal heart.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's like we need to
open enough to allow it in.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's our
evolutionary challenge,

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to be universal, to open.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Like, in foreign policy--
I was thinking this

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:84%
just the other day--
all countries operate

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in what is their own interest.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:41.870 align:middle line:84%
America in the past, she'd
bully those countries

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:90%
who got in her way.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So all the countries are trying
to do what works for them,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:90%
but this has to change.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be a foreign
policy where the superpowers,

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:84%
where China and
Russia and America

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and the European countries,
they need to work together.

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:90%


00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I think this may be
beginning to happen.

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think, although a lot
of people disagree with me,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very good that this
peace treaty that is happening

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with Iran has involved
Russia and America and Iran

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:84%
coming a little bit
closer together.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Last little word
or sentence or message

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:84%
or something that you really
feel would be delicious

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to speak of to close this
conversation on awakening

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:44.425 align:middle line:90%
the universal heart?

00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: Well, the
last message I was going to say

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is how lovely it is to speak
to a woman who is in her heart

00:40:53.560 --> 00:41:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and who has a beautiful smiling
face and who has devoted her

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.090 align:middle line:90%
life to making a difference.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real enormous
pleasure and privilege

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.980 align:middle line:90%
to be talking with you, Lilou.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.895 align:middle line:84%
That's the message
I want to give.

00:41:10.895 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Thank you, Serge.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: That's
the message I want to give.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: [LAUGHS]
Thank you so much.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And thank you to all beautiful
co-creators out there.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Big, big kisses from
beautiful, beautiful London.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Rainy London.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I've just come from Majorca.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It's been beautiful
weather there.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It's rainy old London.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's still a
beauty in the rain.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.327 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
It's fine.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I look forward to
meeting you next time under

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:90%
the sun of Majorca.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.736 align:middle line:90%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS: OK.

00:41:41.736 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Big, big
kisses to all of you.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Much, much love.

00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BEDDINGTON-BEHRENS:
Much love.
