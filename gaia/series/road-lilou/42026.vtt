00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here, on the road
in beautiful London.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, not quite rainy,
but a little bit cloudy,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:84%
as it usually is,
with Menna van Praag.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.285 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Menna.

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MENNA VAN PRAAG:
Hello, Lilou.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you again.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I'm excited to meet
you again here in London.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Last time it was a few years ago
when you were just coming out

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
with your book "Men,
Money, and Chocolate."

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
That's such a delicious book.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And since then you have become
one of those hit novelists.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Thank
you very much.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So I'm excited to
speak about your own journey

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and how this worked out for you.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is more, I
guess, of an interview

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
related to the
teachings of your book,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.080 align:middle line:84%
but before that related to
making your dreams come true.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Because you've always
wanted to be a writer.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But that was not that
easy to get there, was it?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe to us
all the synchronicities

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
in your magnificent story?

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah, sure.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I wanted to be
a writer for a long time.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I graduated from Oxford with
a degree in modern history,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really want
to do anything with it.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So I became a waitress
and wrote in my spare time

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
whenever I could.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And I worked and worked,
and I wrote and wrote.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
to New York, and I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
went on this wonderful
workshop with this couple

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:90%
called Ariel and Shya Kane.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I was so inspired, I came home,
and I took two weeks off work,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote "Men,
Money, and Chocolate."

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I just sat in a room and wrote
the whole thing like that.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I finished
it, and I read it.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
And I read it to my mom.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny
because-- a bit

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of a spoiler in the book--
in the book for the first 2/3

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
of the book it was
really my story

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
about being a waitress,
wanting to be a writer,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing how to do
it, how to be successful.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And then in the second
third of the book,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.071 align:middle line:84%
she publishes her book herself
and then makes a success of it.

00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So my mom read it,
and she said, you

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:90%
must publish this book yourself.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh my god, I
don't know how to do that.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So she said, well,
we can find out.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So we looked online, and
I just found somewhere.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:90%
I self-published it.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I literally
spent months

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
going around Cambridge, my
hometown, Oxford, London,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
going from all the
shops and saying,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:90%
can you please sell this?

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you put it in the window?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I'm sure so
many authors can relate.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would make
chocolate flapjacks

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.092 align:middle line:84%
for them, which
is my speciality,

00:03:05.092 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:90%
and I would take them around.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.758 align:middle line:84%
In England, chocolate
flapjacks are

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
made with oats and
butter and golden syrup.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know in America
it's a bit different.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I would go
back again and say,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:90%
can you put it in the window?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.624 align:middle line:90%
Can you do this?

00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.064 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, I sold
nearly 1,000 copies.

00:03:23.064 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: For some
self-published,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:90%
that's a big number.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.131 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was just my
mission, I suppose.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I got everyone I
knew to buy the book.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And then I went to Hay House.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted them
as my publisher.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:90%
That was just my idea.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go to anyone else.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I went straight to
them, and I said, look,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:90%
this is what I've done.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Could you read the book?

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And I sent them the book.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And a few weeks later, they
called me, and they said,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:90%
we love it.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:90%
Can we take you to lunch?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, OK.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:90%
I was super excited.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's a good
sign, the lunch part.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: The
lunch is a good sign.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I went with the
editor there, Michelle,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:90%
and we spoke for two hours.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.804 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't eat because
I was so nervous.

00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
We're in this beautiful
posh restaurant,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't eat anything.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And they published
the book, I think

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
without changing, really,
anything about it,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
the next year.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
within about a year

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
it was translated into 26
languages or something.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.972 align:middle line:84%
So it did very well for them,
and they were very happy.

00:04:25.972 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But they said to me-- it
was very interesting--

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that if I hadn't
self-published it

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
they probably wouldn't
have taken it on.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the other bit about the
story that I forgot to tell

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
was I actually sent it to
them before self-publishing.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Because it made me nervous.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:84%
How was I going to
do this all myself?

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I sent them the
first manuscript,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
and they sent it back.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh, no.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We have too much of
this, or whatever.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.785 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, no you don't.

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't have anything
like this book.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.701 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like this book.

00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I specifically
wrote this book-- for me,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
it's like "The
Alchemist" for women.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
This was my vision
for this book.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And then I called them.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's so funny.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I called them.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You know when you just
really believe in something?

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I called them, and
I said, I'm going

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
to go out there and show
you what this book can do.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK, whatever.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:84%
It was funny, because
then when I submitted it

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to them again the
woman who'd rejected

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:90%
it had left a little while ago.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
She was someone's assistant,
and she didn't know,

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, the woman
who I then sent it to.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It just goes to
show if you persist

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.075 align:middle line:84%
with something it
can really pay off.

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And you had kind
of an ultimate goal

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to be published by the age of
30, and it happened right then.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.741 align:middle line:84%
Talking of the power
of visualization.

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of information,
knowledge, insight, lessons

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
They're fictional, and we're
going to go into that part.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But you wanted to
be published by 30.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had made this promise
to myself and my husband.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Because I graduated.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Everyone said, get a good job.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Work in the city or something.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I really
want to be a writer.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:90%
And I think I was 21.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, by
the time I'm 30,

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:84%
if I haven't been published
by the time I'm 30,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
then I will give up
and get a real job.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
August or something

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and I turned 30 in October,
and I was like, oh my god, I'm

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:90%
not going to be published.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:90%
I had done nothing.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.866 align:middle line:84%
I'd written many books, but
nothing had happened with them.

00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
to this workshop.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was July, August.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I stood at
the front, and I said,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.664 align:middle line:84%
I made this decision when I was
21, and I made this promise,

00:06:45.664 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and I have to be published
by the time I'm 30.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:90%
But what am I going to do?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember what
they said to me exactly,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%
but it was something inspiring.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went home, and I said,
right, if I have this dream,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to make this happen.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It very much like
this is my dream.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't just wait around.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was really
the message of my book.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
so amazing that you

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
have something that
you need to learn.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down, and I wrote
this book all about courage

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and all about taking action
and all about that you

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
have to do something
for yourself.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.079 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for someone
to take care of it for you.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: No knock at the door.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: No
knock at the door.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was when my
mom said, well, you

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
have to self-publish
this book, then.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was so perfect
that Hay House rejected me

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:90%
the first time.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%
It was so perfect.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I look back on it then,
and I think, yeah,

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
because then I had
to do it myself.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.214 align:middle line:84%
And that changes
you as a person.

00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
You just have more
courage, and I just

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.525 align:middle line:90%
think that makes life wonderful.

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And you have so
much more gratitude, I guess.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because to this
day, it's pretty awesome to be

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
published by Hay House, Hay
House being the publisher

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of famous authors
in the US and the UK,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
including Wayne Dyer, Sonia
Choquette that I love,

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and many, many other
ones, Anita Moorjani, too.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.825 align:middle line:90%
This is the crowd.

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But they bet
a little bit on you,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite different
to write a fictional--

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:90%
this is a fiction book.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, they
didn't do any fiction.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.700 align:middle line:90%
They just did facts.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:90%
And now they do.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:90%
But this was back in 2009.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
They didn't do
any fiction, which

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
was why when they sent it
away the first time I said,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:90%
but you have nothing like this.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:90%
This is unique for you.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I think because it was
a success, then they thought,

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is kind of cool.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And now they've
expanded into fiction.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:84%
What do you say then to
people that have dreams?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember publishing
my book and finding yours.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how originally
I heard about you.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.795 align:middle line:84%
Because I went into a bookstore,
and this lady or this man

00:08:50.795 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
told me, oh, this
is a great example.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Menna van Praag
with her book just

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
got published by Hay House,
and maybe you too one day.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So it gives energy, and
it gives inspiration

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to hear another
story like yours.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever our dream is, we have
our own version of our dream.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we try to
do it as others do it.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.955 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
real fulfillment.

00:09:13.955 --> 00:09:14.705 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
No, I really believe in,
yeah, finding your own dream,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
your own passion,
and not giving up.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Just keep going and keep going.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It took me, what, 10
years to get published?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I really had so many
nights, I don't know,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:90%
midnight I'm still working.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing on napkins.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember saying so
many times to my husband,

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:90%
am I doing the right thing?

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Should I give up?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, no, no, no.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew I would never give up,
but I had these many moments

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
of thinking, really,
what am I doing?

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends
in New York who

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.772 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking to last
night, and they're actors,

00:09:54.772 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:90%
and they have the same thing.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.625 align:middle line:90%
She's saying, it's been so long.

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:59.057 align:middle line:90%
And I said, don't give up.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't give up.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you hear these
wonderful stories.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember I heard
this story, and I

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
used to collect these stories.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
When I was kind of in these
dark nights of the soul,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I would look and I would
find-- and I remember one.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Jim Carrey, when he
was a struggling actor

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
he wrote himself a
check for $20 million.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.710 align:middle line:84%
He put it up on his
mantelpiece, and he's

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
like, one day I'm going
to get paid $20 million.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first actor
to ever get paid $20 million

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:90%
for one film.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's
so interesting,

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
this idea of how you really
manifest these dreams.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:84%
I genuinely believe that
the universe rewards courage

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and that you kind of keep
getting knocked back,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
you keep getting knocked back.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.731 align:middle line:84%
And it's how many
times are you going

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to stand up again
and keep going.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Another thing
about you too is you have

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
a child-like attitude.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You get excited, and you love
chocolate, and you run around.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You have this little girl
still in you, alive, huh?

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.787 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of teachers
speak about that.

00:11:01.787 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
never left or you

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
had to work on it or relearn how
to be grateful or live fully?

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.681 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that
develops through time?

00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Well I
was always like that.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, for sure.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And then my 20s were hard.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I got knocked around
a bit by life,

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and I had two major illnesses
that came very close,

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
so that was difficult.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:90%
And a few things happened.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, when I
went on this workshop--

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I do things to cultivate
this feeling of gratitude,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
this feeling of
enjoying every moment.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I always read books like this.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:90%
I watch movies like this.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I go to these workshops.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything I can do
to cultivate that love of life.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Because you have so much
negativity in the world

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.015 align:middle line:84%
and so much people going
around being all grumpy.

00:11:58.015 --> 00:12:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I do Lindy Hop dancing,
which I love very much.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Just everything you can do to
make you feel good, I think,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And the magic seems
to happen outside of our comfort

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:90%
zone.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be outside, not
just right here where we are at.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But we have to kind
of go an meet it.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.369 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that feeling?

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's so funny.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at this comfort
zone thing the other day.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
realized in me I

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
have this-- I don't know if
everyone has it-- inertia.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Even, for example, with
something simple like dancing--

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:90%
and I love dancing.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
I love it-- every
Wednesday night

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
there's this piece of me going
maybe I'll just stay at home

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:90%
and sit on the sofa.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll just stay
in in my pajamas.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
this little piece of me

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:90%
that has to get over that.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, no,
I love to dance.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I love to go out and do this.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think self-publishing

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
was such a phenomenal
thing for me,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
because this is not in my
nature to go out and do this

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading this
wonderful story, again,

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:90%
was about John Grisham.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he first
published his first book,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he self-published,
but he published it.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And he went literally
all around the South

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to bookshop to bookshop
to bookshop saying,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
please, put my
book in the window.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.142 align:middle line:84%
Please, put my book
on the display.

00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize when you're
an author that if they just

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
put it on the
shelf really no one

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
sees it if you don't have
the publicity behind you.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
gosh, I would never

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.682 align:middle line:90%
have the courage to do that.

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:42.642 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was so
good that I did that.

00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, I
would probably still

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
be sitting at home on
my sofa writing my books

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:90%
and not getting them published.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So how
did you get started?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.995 align:middle line:84%
Why was it "Men,
Money, and Chocolate?"

00:13:53.995 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Where did the creativity
come from, really?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
How do you start when
you write a story?

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.395 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Well, that
story was very unique.

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.405 align:middle line:90%
How you had said-- it came in.

00:14:04.405 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: It came in.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.972 align:middle line:84%
I was having a
conversation with my mom,

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and we have these very
inspiring conversations.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:90%
She's a life coach.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about happiness and joy

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and enlightenment.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, how
come we're not like this

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.372 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:14:19.372 --> 00:14:21.246 align:middle line:84%
Because we were sitting
in the summer garden.

00:14:21.246 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
It was such a beautiful day.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:90%
We were so happy.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Why does this not just last?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, it's men,
money, and chocolate.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:90%
It just came out of nowhere.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's all
the things that we

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
think we need to make us
happy, all the things outside

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
We think we need money
and wealth and success.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We think we need a man
and a relationship.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We think we need pleasure
of any kind, shopping, food,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I said it, and I said, oh,
great book title that would be.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.670 align:middle line:84%
But it took me four
years of living

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to live-- I knew I
couldn't write it then,

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because I was in my
early 20s or my mid 20s.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Things had happened, but I
hadn't had that life experience

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to write a book like that.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So I waited four
years, and it was

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
kind of mulling
around-- maybe that's

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
why I wrote it so
quick in two weeks,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
because it was in there--
then I lived a whole bunch,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and then I could really
sit down and write it.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.089 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.089 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So the book
title came like that,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and then the writing also.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.864 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people speak of
those writing blockages

00:15:26.864 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
or those other things.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You haven't experienced
any of that, obviously.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But I guess for the other
novels and the latest one,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
there's been a lot
more work involved.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.169 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's easy to compare.

00:15:40.169 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.510 align:middle line:84%
This was a very unique
experience, really.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I look back on
it now, I think, wow.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Because I sat down in a
room-- it's a very short book.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote the
book in two weeks.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember every day, I just
got up and I wrote and wrote.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
published it, I really

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:90%
hadn't edited it that much.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I really didn't
change much at all.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when they published it,
they didn't change it at all.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.740 align:middle line:90%
It was really funny.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.405 align:middle line:84%
And then I published the
sequel, and I wrote the sequel

00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%
in three weeks.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was very easy,
and they didn't edit it.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And now I just published a big
book, a sort of proper fiction

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.011 align:middle line:84%
book, and that took me two and
a half years, maybe three years

00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
to write.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And it went through
20-something drafts.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So this was a very
different experience.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us about the
lessons and what happens

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
in "Men, Money,
Chocolate," for example,

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:90%
that one in particular.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I want to speak of your
latest one after that,

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
but this one was
very interesting.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.599 align:middle line:90%
I was very excited when--

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: I remember.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.556 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: --I read it.

00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.720 align:middle line:84%
That really spoke to me
truth about our own journey

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:90%
as a woman.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's wonderful
for me, because I've

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
had so many-- I was
going to say letters--

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
but emails from women all
over the world saying,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:90%
this is my story.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.200 align:middle line:90%
This is my life.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:90%
This is my journey.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think, well, I
just wrote it about me.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Because I didn't really know.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say
something to women,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:84%
but I just had to
say it from my heart.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
And so I just thought what
is the most important things

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
that I need to know as a woman?

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So I started off,
the first thing

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
was about not losing yourself
in a relationship, how

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
we've all been there, I'm sure.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
We fall for a man, and then
we kind of twist ourselves

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and change ourselves and try
and fit into the relationship.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we think that if
we lose that relationship

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.569 align:middle line:90%
we lose a piece of ourselves.

00:17:40.569 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But really, we've lost
a piece of ourselves

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:90%
in the relationship.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote about that.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote about how you
really have to love yourself

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and how to cherish and love
yourself before you find a man.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So then you can really be
happy within that relationship.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
important for me.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to write about
loving your body

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
as it is, not about
trying to change

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
it to fit some ideal of
how we think it should be

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and really how you
can love yourself

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and how you can embrace yourself
and then what that can lead to

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and how you can lose weight
without dieting as well.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
write about success

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and fulfilling your
heart and how important

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:34.374 align:middle line:84%
it is to go from your passion
and not from your head where

00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, this
is what I should do,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
because this will
lead me to success.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
authentic about it.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought what are
the things that really you

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
need to do to have
all these things?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And for me, courage
was the first one.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's really like my
mantra every day.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So courage was really about the
finances and the relationship

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What do you mean
it's your mantra every day?

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
You tell yourself when you wake
up today let's have courage?

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Not consciously.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:90%
But it's in there.

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, maybe I'm quite
a shy person naturally

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and quite inert, like my
comfort zone is my sofa.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And so courage is
really important for me.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I tell
myself it every day,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.996 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely kind of
tattooed on my heart somewhere.

00:19:27.996 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You're
conscious of it.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So then when I do
things, like go and do

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
talks or workshops, that kind
of thing, and just to be present

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and not to worry.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I learned some great lessons
about being present and taking

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
my attention off myself
and giving a gift

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to other people,
this kind of thing.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And connection was
really another.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I had three, which is
courage, compassion

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
for yourself is so
important, and connection

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And that comes under
courage as well.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But the book is all about this
woman, and she starts off,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and she's so scared of life.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Maya.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.909 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't
connect with anyone.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:13.647 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't really
connect with herself.

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And she has to go
out and meet people.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go
out and meet people,

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
you find the most
amazing things.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
We met, and it was a miracle.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And you meet another person,
and you meet another person.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:90%
This is how life can transform.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Nothing transforms when you're
sitting at home on your sofa,

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.640 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And then compassion
is so important.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I never used to have
compassion for myself.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.446 align:middle line:90%
I was so hard on myself.

00:20:36.446 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I was so hard on
myself that I couldn't

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:84%
write, because I thought
everything has to be perfect,

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, Austen,
nothing is good enough.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't finish.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't finish a sentence.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So I had to have
compassion for myself.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:90%
And then I had to have courage.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was
at Oxford University,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:90%
it was very high standards.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And for me to write a book like
"Men, Money, and Chocolate,"

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
it so much comes from my heart.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a high
literature book.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just a very simple
book, but it's really

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:90%
an expression of me.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And that took courage, to
express yourself, your heart

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe people will
say, oh, that's rubbish.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
the courage to keep

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
stepping out there
and giving yourself.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.701 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's so easy to
compare ourselves with others

00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
or stop from those limiting
beliefs that we have.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain standard.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
type of writing.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
When really the world
now wants authenticity

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:90%
and love and truth, huh?

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that more and more?

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel this
shift or this change?

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Is it really happening?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah,
I feel it, really.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I tell people-- because now
I teach writing as well,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:90%
which I love.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, that was something
I was so scared to do.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought I can write, because
writing is my comfort zone.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And teaching is really
not my comfort zone.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But people were writing
to me and asking me

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to send me their
books and this kind of thing.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought really this is
something I could love this.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I love it so much.

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
thing with connection.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell my students if
you're writing something really

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:84%
from your heart there will
be someone else out there who

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
wants that, who
wants to hear that.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I really wrote
"Men, Money, and Chocolate"

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:90%
from my heart.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think--

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't know about
marketing or publicity

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think, what
will women like?

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I just had to say
what was true for me.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So I always think
now, yes, some people

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
will resonate with
Shakespeare, a lot of people,

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have to write
like Shakespeare or Jane Austen

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to have people
resonate with you.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I always believe we're
like tuning forks,

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and there's people
out there-- like when

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.290 align:middle line:84%
we met-- it's a little
soulmate connection.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
You feel that.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:90%
And I felt that.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are people out
there always for everyone,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
just like the love of
your life is out there.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, the people who you
connect with are out there.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you express yourself
as your authentic self,

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
there will always be people
who will connect with that.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Then you attract
by expressing ourselves.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.009 align:middle line:84%
By expressing our
true selves, then we

00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:22.050 align:middle line:90%
attract the right people.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it's kind
of like just we

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:84%
attract more or less
of the old same kind

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:90%
of mask-type attitude.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Then our life is
not truthful, not meaningful,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
not what it could be
to this juiciness.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Your latest book,
the one with the house.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.580 align:middle line:84%
What is it called,
the full title?

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: "The House
at the End of Hope Street."

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So tell
us about that one,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.458 align:middle line:84%
because it seems
really intriguing.

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to read it.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.650 align:middle line:84%
There is those
chocolate, apparently,

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that have magic
potions, and there

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.184 align:middle line:84%
is ghosts that
have conversations.

00:23:59.184 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear all about it.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.602 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Well, this
was a bit more of an epic.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not really,
but it took me,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
like I say, many
years to write this.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It's fiction, but there's
so much of me in it still.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I can't right
real fiction-fiction.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
write about a house

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
that women came to when
they reached the end of hope

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So something had happened to
them, and they just give up.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.324 align:middle line:84%
And this idea came to me I think
when I'd finished "Men, Money,

00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and Chocolate,"
and it was getting

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
published all over
the world and I

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
was getting these
emails from women.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If I ever became a millionaire
or something from books,

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.780 align:middle line:84%
then I would buy
a big house, and I

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:90%
would have it for artists.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And they could each live
there for a year or something,

00:24:55.810 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
for writers, for actors, for
painters, professions where

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard
to do it and have

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
a full-time job
at the same time.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it took me 10 years
while I was waitressing.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I think, well,
that was also a perfect.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But maybe if I'd have
had the opportunity

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:84%
to be somewhere to get
a grant to just write,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.525 align:middle line:84%
maybe I could have
finished it sooner.

00:25:18.525 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this would be
such a wonderful thing to do.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And this idea came, and
it kind of stayed in there

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.949 align:middle line:90%
and percolated.

00:25:25.949 --> 00:25:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, I was in
Brooklyn, and I was walking down

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:84%
the street with my husband,
and we saw this house,

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and we stopped to look
at it and take photos,

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%
because it really had
kind of a slightly

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:90%
spooky, magical quality to it.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, ooh.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And the book started
to come to the surface.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came home,
I visited another friend,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and she was living in kind
of a women's, not a refuge

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:90%
but a commune place.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And the house was an old
mill, and it had been adapted.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing, because
I literally walked in,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and I felt almost like
the walls were breathing

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and the house was
kind of hugging me.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It felt so welcoming.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And we went and had
tea in the kitchen,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and it was like it was alive.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The house was alive and almost
like the lights kind of dipped

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
down to have a look
at us or something.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.366 align:middle line:84%
And I went home, and
I started "The House

00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
at the End of Hope Street."

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It started off as this
Victorian house, and it's alive,

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and it attracts women who
reach the end of hope.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're wandering
around the streets crying,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:84%
because maybe their
boyfriend had an affair

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
or they lost their
jobs or something

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:90%
awful happened to them.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And then they find
themselves on the doorstep,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and they think, what am I doing
on the doorstep of this house?

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And this old lady
who owns the house,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
she opens the door,
because she always

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
knows they're coming
because she's psychic,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:90%
and invites them in.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And she gives them a
magical hot chocolate,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and they go to sleep
in a bed upstairs.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And when they wake up, the
room is their own room.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Exactly it has what they need in
order to transform their lives.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And they get to stay there
for three months, for 99 days

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:90%
And their life transforms.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I wrote about.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.495 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: That's exciting.

00:27:17.495 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: When you write it,
do you see it as a movie?

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.692 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah,
always, funnily enough.

00:27:25.692 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Maybe one
day it'll be a movie.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: That
would be lovely.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's one
of your other dreams?

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the film script for
"Men, Money, and Chocolate"

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.676 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:27:34.676 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah?

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: And I worked
on it with a producer,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
but it fell through for
one reason or another.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.089 align:middle line:84%
But the film script
is still there.

00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's a good one,
if there is ever Hollywood

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:90%
producers watching this.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I know Gaiam TV is big
in California and in the US.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
But this is a great book.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I have to speak to Bern
and Baine about this.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:90%
It gives me an idea.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.259 align:middle line:84%
No, but I could so
see it as a movie,

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:84%
"Men, Money, and Chocolate,"
and probably this other one too.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.425 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:28:03.425 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:90%
It speaks to our heart.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what's the beauty.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I think some people are so
great at painting or explaining

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:90%
complex things.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:21.217 align:middle line:84%
But this one is so simple and
just speaks to our hearts.

00:28:21.217 --> 00:28:23.425 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing, I just
came back from Barcelona.

00:28:23.425 --> 00:28:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed this artist, and
his drawings are so simple.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.050 align:middle line:90%
But they say it all.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Either you're
reaching your heart

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:84%
or you live from the
heart right there.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
society needs right now,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.790 align:middle line:84%
just get it really fast, and
let's all move forward together

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:90%
in this heart dimension.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're very much
into the living from the heart.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the conversations

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:90%
that we had years ago.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.569 align:middle line:84%
Is that also part of the
message of this new book?

00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.693 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Those women, what
do they get out of the whole

00:28:56.693 --> 00:28:57.839 align:middle line:90%
experience there?

00:28:57.839 --> 00:28:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They definitely
discover their hearts.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I think whenever you lose
hope you've lost touch

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:90%
with your heart, haven't you?

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
connected with your heart,

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:90%
you always have hope.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
You always have that connection
with what's possible.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever lose
hope, it's because you've

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%
lost touch with your heart.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So they all start
off in the house,

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're all disconnected
in certain ways,

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and they all discover
their heart connection.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:90%
They discover their courage.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.560 align:middle line:84%
They discover their dreams,
the possibilities of life,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
love, all this.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.495 align:middle line:90%
And then they leave.

00:29:34.495 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.516 align:middle line:90%
Are they afraid to leave?

00:29:37.516 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes when we're
so nurtured and we feel

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
we've got something
or we do a seminar

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:84%
or we hear a video or we've
got it, and we're like,

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, but I might
lose this one day.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes, definitely.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes your
new comfort zone, doesn't it?

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So then you have to be
comfortable with letting go

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and moving on to the next
thing and not really holding

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
onto the good experiences as
well as the bad experiences.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Because every new experience is
a new piece of life, isn't it?

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:90%
It's always change.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Life is a guarantee to change.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I have this now, I
think, with my son.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because he's two years old,
and he's such a cute age.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.472 align:middle line:90%
I treasure the days every day.

00:30:22.472 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think he's
going to be grown.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
He's already grown so much.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
And everything changes.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:90%
We'll always change.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.994 align:middle line:84%
So you just appreciate
what you have now,

00:30:30.994 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and then it will go
onto the next thing,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and it'll will be something
new and something different.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:90%
So letting go is also important.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's good.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Were you able to
have your chocolate store?

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.669 align:middle line:84%
I remember Maya, didn't she
have this chocolate place

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.126 align:middle line:84%
Was it at the beginning
of the story or after?

00:30:47.126 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:90%
I guess at the end.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.345 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Well, she had
a cafe in the beginning.

00:30:50.345 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.719 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: But I've
always had a dream,

00:30:52.719 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:84%
because my husband's a chef,
of having a bookstore cafe.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:90%
This is always this thing.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny how
you have these dreams

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:90%
and what happens to them.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I also love
bookstores, but I

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
love stationary shops as
well, paper, envelopes.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I literally went into Liberty
sometime in the summer,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and saw their stationery shop,
and I got almost a head buzz

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:84%
I got giddy because it was so
beautiful, all these papers.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I met this woman,
this thing with connection,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.160 align:middle line:84%
and she told me
that she always had

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:84%
this fantasy of having
a stationery shop

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and having it be
about letter writing

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and about the lost
art of letter writing.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And when she told me this
story, I got goosebumps,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and I felt the air
kind of crackling.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh my god,
I would love this.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And my husband could
have a little cafe,

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and we could have sort of a
bookshop with a stationery

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.996 align:middle line:90%
shop.

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So the dream is very
much alive in me.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I went home,
and I was looking

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
for a new idea
for a book anyway.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And I started to write
this book about someone who

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:84%
has a stationery shop and this
sort of magical letter writing

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.740 align:middle line:90%
area in it.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Then I spoke to another
woman I met last week

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and told her about this dream.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I've always
wanted to have a shop like this

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and design it.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And her husband is a designer,
and he makes everything

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to order.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.735 align:middle line:84%
He's like a carpenter as
well and an architect.

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought maybe we
could all do it together.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is the thing.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.664 align:middle line:84%
You have a dream, and you never
know how it will manifest.

00:32:32.664 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But you have to keep
talking, don't you?

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep putting it out
there and see what will happen.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.611 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: And feeling it.

00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
much alive right now.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: For you, tell us
what makes you really happy.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.705 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you have this
little list on your website,

00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and I love it, what
makes you truly happy.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I love when you get in
that zone of sharing,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.290 align:middle line:84%
when people just
open their heart,

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and you're just able to
feel it and be there.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think all of us
can be part of that.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:06.046 align:middle line:84%
So what makes you truly
happy, Menna van Praag?

00:33:06.046 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: I think the
thing that makes me happiest is

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
people, for sure.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, because in the
past I didn't think that.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I was so shy, and I thought
what makes me happiest

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:84%
is to be writing, which does
make me very happy to write.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of hide behind
my words, and I go home,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:90%
and I'm writing, and so on.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, meeting this
woman and discussing this idea

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.140 align:middle line:90%
with her.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You know when you make
connection with someone

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and you start really
buzzing from it?

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
a new book topic,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.832 align:middle line:84%
and I was going around
in my head too much.

00:33:43.832 --> 00:33:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I always think if
things aren't going well,

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:84%
if you have a bit of
writer's block or something,

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:90%
just go outside.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Go out and maybe meet someone.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was so funny, because
I was teaching this class.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I give my students
homework every week.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I got so excited
by our class,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
we were so passionately talking
about writing, and I said,

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I will join the
homework this week,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
and I will write the first
chapter of my new book.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day,
I was like, oh my gosh,

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:90%
now I have to keep my word.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
little panic, because I

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what I
was going to write.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I'd started something, but it
wasn't really going anywhere.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And then my friend texted me.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
She said, do you want
to come out for cake?

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I said, I always want
to come out for cake.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:84%
And I never say no
to this question.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.389 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the
cafe, and I said, look,

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of
struggling with this.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:84%
And so I started talking
about this to her.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I said, this is
what's exciting me.

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And literally within two hours
we had created a whole book.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:90%
It was so funny.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I cycled home, and I
was giggling to myself.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was so excited and
squealing on the bike.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And the leaves were
blowing in the autumn wind.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was so beautiful.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I watched this beautiful
movie in September

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.480 align:middle line:90%
called "About Time."

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen it?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.525 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: No.

00:35:07.525 --> 00:35:08.733 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: It's so lovely.

00:35:08.733 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:84%
It's by Richard Curtis,
whom I love anyway.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about how this
moment that we have is perfect.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have the idea that
other moments are more perfect.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with
the idea, because he

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
said if he had just one day
to live that he could choose

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.710 align:middle line:84%
any day of his life--
because this guy travels

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in time in this movie--
which day would he choose?

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it wouldn't be
a day where I won awards.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't be a big party.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.460 align:middle line:84%
It would just be a simple
day with my family,

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.230 align:middle line:84%
with the people I love, on
a beach, having a tea party.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that's so lovely.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the character,
first he goes back in time

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
to all the days he
thinks are the best days,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and then he really learns that
every day, every simple little

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.835 align:middle line:84%
day is perfect if you're
just there to experience

00:36:04.835 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:90%
it and connect with it enjoy it.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yeah,
that's so true.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So yesterday I took my son out
to kick through some leaves

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:90%
on the sidewalk.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: I would do it.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind of--
these little days.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I found a new book, and I was
reading on the train on the way

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:90%
here, and I was so excited.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I discovered knitting.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.120 align:middle line:90%
I love to knit.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.405 align:middle line:84%
And I get so excited when
I make something new.

00:36:32.405 --> 00:36:34.517 align:middle line:84%
All these little things
in life that sometimes--

00:36:34.517 --> 00:36:35.725 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: You love chocolate.

00:36:35.725 --> 00:36:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: And
I love chocolate.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So I went just to Notting Hill
before coming to visit you,

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.107 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, oh my gosh,
all these new chocolates.

00:36:43.107 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us about the
name of that beautiful place

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.172 align:middle line:90%
in Notting Hill.

00:36:46.172 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Oh, Melt.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Melt.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: That was
where I took you, right,

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.450 align:middle line:90%
the first time.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.927 align:middle line:84%
I visit there every time I come
to London, and it's gorgeous.

00:36:53.927 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:90%
And they did macaroons today.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.373 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
ooh, very exciting.

00:36:59.373 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It's little things of
life that get you--

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I bought my friend, she
showed me yesterday--

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.480 align:middle line:84%
this is the actress
in New York-- I

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.180 align:middle line:90%
bought her a little bookmark.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And it says something about
treasuring the little things

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.155 align:middle line:84%
in life, because one day
you'll look back and realize

00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.405 align:middle line:90%
that they were the big things.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, yeah,
that's so true.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can lose
perspective thinking, oh,

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.810 align:middle line:84%
what's really the big things
is getting a book published.

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:90%
This is not true really at all.

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's the
journey to it, huh?

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.965 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I had my
book launch for "Men, Money,

00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:40.575 align:middle line:84%
and Chocolate" in Cambridge,
which was my hometown,

00:37:40.575 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and we had it in the Borders,
and we had the whole floor.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We had hundreds of
people there, and it

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:84%
was a really huge success,
and it was amazing.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I'm going to
feel so amazing on this night,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's this
culmination of a dream

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:90%
that I've had my whole life.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And here it is.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I didn't
feel that way at all.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.480 align:middle line:90%
I kind of had that buzz.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And the night was over, and I
was like, oh, OK, this is it.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.080 align:middle line:90%
But really nothing had changed.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes you tell
yourself this will change me

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:90%
or this will complete me.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
it's the journey.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.790 align:middle line:90%
It's really not the destination.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But you don't almost believe
that until you experience it.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.819 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out,
yeah, that's so true.

00:38:22.819 --> 00:38:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us about some of
those other insights that you

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:90%
had writing your other books.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
writing another one

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:90%
and another one and another one.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You're just this
writer now, full-time.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:90%
So no blockages, just full-on.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.750 align:middle line:84%
What is the next one
or the next topic?

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.505 align:middle line:84%
Or what do you feel is
important to bring out?

00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Well, the one
that's coming out after "Hope

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Street" is about a
magical dress shop.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.377 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
the theme of-- yeah,

00:38:49.377 --> 00:38:51.585 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's sort of all these
themes from "Men, Money,

00:38:51.585 --> 00:38:53.043 align:middle line:84%
and Chocolate,"
they're coming out,

00:38:53.043 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
but they're coming out
longer and bigger and richer.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's so theatrical.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I could totally see that
with movies and theaters

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and with the costumes.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: So colorful.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Your books are so colorful.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yes.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They're all set in
Cambridge, and then I

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.720 align:middle line:84%
pick a different place,
a different location.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Hope Street house is this
grand magical Victorian house

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.260 align:middle line:84%
with these incredible
rooms, and it's gorgeous.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And that was very much
about bringing out

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:90%
the theme of courage again.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And the next book is
"Fabric of Wonders."

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is about a
magical dress shop.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is very much
the theme of compassion.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the woman who
owns the dress shop,

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:84%
she draws to her women
who aren't looking

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:43.120 align:middle line:84%
for the perfect dress to make
them look thinner or make

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:90%
them look taller or whatever.

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
She draws women who are looking
for a piece of themselves.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.370 align:middle line:84%
They have something
that's lost inside them.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know somehow where
you can put on an outfit

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and it makes you feel
a million dollars?

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And you just think
I could do anything.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So she has a little
magic stitch.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So she finds an amazing
dress, and these women who

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.440 align:middle line:84%
think that they're
not much, they

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.270 align:middle line:84%
look at themselves in the
mirror and they think, hold on.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And what am I capable of?

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And they see a
part of themselves

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.349 align:middle line:90%
that they never saw before.

00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And then she makes a
little magical stitch,

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and she says, you know, any
time that you need that feeling

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
again, you put on
this dress, and you

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.140 align:middle line:90%
know you're going to be OK.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is another theme that
I brought out in this book.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And it has many other elements.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a man with a
magical voice in there

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.070 align:middle line:84%
who when he reads to you
you feel transformed.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And he's in love
with a scientist

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't notice him because
she's always stuck in her head.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
different themes.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
some kind of thing

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:84%
about courage,
compassion, connection.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:90%
These things stay with me.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Where
is all this going?

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine or see
what the full puzzle

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.432 align:middle line:84%
will be like later on
in 20 years, 30 years?

00:41:02.432 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: No.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.625 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part
of the journey.

00:41:04.625 --> 00:41:05.250 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.041 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: I'll look
back and, oh, yeah.

00:41:07.041 --> 00:41:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what it-- I'll
see all these threads.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.800 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I think I wrote
"Men, Money, and Chocolate"

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.410 align:middle line:90%
for myself.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:90%
It was almost like a fantasy.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Then I made it happen.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was funny.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Because when I wrote the
sequel, I wrote the sequel

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:84%
about having a relationship and
about dealing with some success

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that you've had in your life and
about having balance and about

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:84%
family and what did
you want to have.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's so funny because
a great chunk of it

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.660 align:middle line:90%
hadn't happened.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.400 align:middle line:84%
In "Men, Money, and Chocolate,"
it hadn't happened to me.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But then it happened,
and it was almost as

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
if I'm writing these things
and then they happen.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I look back on it, and I was
re-reading a portion of it

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the other day because I
had to go and give a talk.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh my god.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:84%
That's really crazy that
that then happened to me.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So you changed
character in each of them?

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:90%
The first one, you were Maya.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.610 align:middle line:90%
In the latest one, what are you?

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.759 align:middle line:84%
Are you this person that
puts the costume on?

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Yeah.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.455 align:middle line:84%
In "Men, Money, and
Chocolate," I was so Maya,

00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and that was
absolutely my story.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who knows
me who reads it says,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.700 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, that's so you.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And now because there
are many, many characters

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in all the different
books, maybe there's

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.510 align:middle line:84%
a piece of me in many
of the characters,

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.991 align:middle line:84%
but there's not really one
character that I think,

00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:29.490 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.770 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sort of more
removed from it a bit.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:90%
But it's a different experience.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Last little word
of inspiration for all

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.009 align:middle line:84%
the co-creators
watching right now?

00:42:44.009 --> 00:42:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAG: Stick with your
dreams, and never, never,

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:90%
never, never give up.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I wrote in "Men,
Money, and Chocolate,"

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:84%
if you don't give
up, you can't fail.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.277 align:middle line:90%
That's what I say.

00:42:52.277 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Mmm.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Menna, for this
delicious conversation.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAG: Thank you.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And big, big kisses to
all juicy co-creators watching

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:00.890 align:middle line:90%
this video.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:01.640 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.355 align:middle line:84%
We send you so much love
from beautiful London.

00:43:04.355 --> 00:43:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Cut.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.728 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:16.434 align:middle line:90%
