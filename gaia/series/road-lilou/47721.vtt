00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the road.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
This show is called
"Lilou on the Road"

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.526 align:middle line:90%
because I keep on traveling.

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I keep on going
around the world,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.865 align:middle line:84%
and here I am in Sri
Lanka wearing a sari.

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:27.365 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:29.823 align:middle line:84%

00:00:29.823 --> 00:00:30.597 align:middle line:90%
the bright colors.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: I feel like a goddess.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.062 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: You are.

00:00:33.062 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: This is going to
be a goddess conversation,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.924 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: It is.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It is definitely.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So we're going to
have this is a really cool

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
conversation, because you
have made quite a change

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're this beautiful
designer, clothes designer,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.117 align:middle line:84%
and you bring amazing passions
and creations to this world.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Totally inspired,
totally about consciousness

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.442 align:middle line:84%
and living love and life
and this juicy life.

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:90%
You're living it.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:90%
You're embodying it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing
changes in your life.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're all
making this change.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
There is signs of it.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit, and for
some people it's a lot more

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.357 align:middle line:84%
and getting quicker and faster,
and big downloads for you, huh?

00:01:16.357 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.752 align:middle line:84%
Big downloads, huge,
massive downloads.

00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:90%
So you were awarded last week.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
There is the-- Colombo is the
main city here in Sri Lanka.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So you were awarded, tell us,
in this Colombo Fashion Week.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
This time during
Colombo Fashion Week, I

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
was awarded as the
Gen-Next Designer, which

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
means the most promising
designer for the future

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.107 align:middle line:90%
to look out for.

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:40.731 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's exciting.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.122 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.122 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I didn't even
know that there was the Fashion

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Week here happening, and
then to be witnessing this

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and to see talents like you
that are into the healing

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.886 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time that
have this creation, that

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:58.897 align:middle line:84%
have this creativity
and receive it,

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:90%
we have a lot to learn from you.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking forward
to this conversation.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Where were you at before?

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Or where are you at now?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we look at both
the before and the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
after to kind of
see the difference

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.459 align:middle line:90%
and to see where we're at?

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we're pretty much
going through the same thing,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I guess.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:10%
It's a long story
and a long journey.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:10%
But before, I
guess you could say

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:10%
that I became
interested in fashion

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:10%
somewhere around maybe
when I was about 21,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.915 align:middle line:10%
and I started studying fashion.

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Up until that point, I was,
but I wasn't that much.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly it was if a light
switch had gone off in my head.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I
need to stop all this

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and start studying fashion.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew it, and then
everything fell into place

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
for it, and I started
studying fashion.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Here in Sri Lanka.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.876 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA:
Here in Sri Lanka,

00:02:50.876 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
but it was a British
qualification.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And the-- it was under
Edexcel BTEC in the UK,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
so they had the
lecturers come down,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and there's a school here
that does the teaching, right?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.472 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: So I did not
have even the finances at that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
point to support my education.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.735 align:middle line:84%
And then overnight this friend
just comes up to me and says,

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I know you want money for
something and here's the money,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:90%
and just gives me raw cash.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And the following day
was the day, last day,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
to pay for the school fees
or else I would not get in.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So the following day, early
morning, I just went and paid.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And the friend who came, gave
me the money never even wanted

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:90%
the money back.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So you could say right from
day one it was ordained to be.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Divine.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.299 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Exactly.

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Divine intervention.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.871 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: So I went.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I studied.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a beautiful experience.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And during the time when
I was studying fashion,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
obviously you go into--
creativity opens up,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:84%
you up into a
different awareness

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
or a different awareness
opens you up into creativity.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:90%
It's interconnected.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:90%
You cannot separate it.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was more
into spirituality,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
although I was a born
Buddhist and then

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
we came from a very orthodox
Buddhist kind of family.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like do
this, don't do that,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and stick to the Five Precepts
and that kind of background.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.895 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Lots of
Buddhists in this country?

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah,
majority Buddhists.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.425 align:middle line:90%
I would say about 75% Buddhists.

00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:90%
I love seeing those big Buddhas.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.959 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah,
they're everywhere here.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's more of a very
religious kind of background,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
a very religious kind
of Buddhist background.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.045 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Strict, with
rules and regulations.

00:04:28.045 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to break away.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I was looking
into-- I was going to church,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
the Hindu temples.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I was going into these
meditation programs,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading
a lot on stuff.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I was reading on the different
treatise of different names.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I've read everything you could
say, almost, not everything.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
There's so much.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What
were you searching?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: I was searching
for the truth, I suppose.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.786 align:middle line:84%
I was searching
for something that

00:04:54.786 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%
made me feel as if I was home.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I've been searching
since I was 21

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
until a couple of months
ago, and at that point

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
then I found Sai Baba.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
So I went to India.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:90%
I started doing all that.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
I became a vegetarian.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I stopped-- I stopped, you
know-- because Sai Baba speaks

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.669 align:middle line:84%
of-- he doesn't
speak of religion,

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
but he speaks of,
like, spirituality,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
but strict disciplinarian.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.786 align:middle line:90%
So I went into all that.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Then that
becomes a religion.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Exactly.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I would meditate,
get up early at 4 o'clock,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
5 o'clock in the
morning, meditate.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So college finished, meanwhile.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
College finished, and
I started working.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I was working in
the garment export trade

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and designing and developing
for huge brands in the US,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
such as Ann Taylor, Reebok,
Nike, Calvin Klein, some

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest, biggest
retailers that you could find.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Next in the UK as well, Next,
Wallis, brands such as that.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the industry
for, like, seven years,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and during that time my
spiritual journey was that,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.895 align:middle line:84%
OK, I was looking, and I
was finding certain things,

00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and I was getting more and more
into meditation, into reiki,

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
into yoga, more into the
Vedantic path of things.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
At one point, I would
only wear white,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
meditate for eight hours
a day, eat one meal a day,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and not leave my room.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.944 align:middle line:84%
So it became so intense
that I went into--

00:06:24.944 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So you were
not living life anymore.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.735 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:06:27.735 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I was not living life
anymore, basically.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
thought, OK, this is it.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I found it.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.565 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:06:33.565 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But I always had this kind
of feeling in my heart

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that something was missing,
that it was not all perfect.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:90%
So along comes--

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.869 align:middle line:84%
And then at one point,
after seven years,

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I just let go of my job,
because I felt that, you know,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:84%
this is not-- because the work
was very hectic on its own

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, OK, fine.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It's time to let go of my job.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So I let go of my job,
and then suddenly I

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
was without any money.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:90%
I was without anything.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And then comes-- the depression
sets in, because suddenly, you

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
know, everything, everybody's
like, why aren't you working?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
You studied, you worked so hard,
and the pressure and all that.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So it was like a very
dark period of my life.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And in your darkest corner is
where you truly find light,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and that really happened to me.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And I went into, like,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you could say I was
really depressed in a way.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then to add to that,
my father passed away.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of took everything
to the lowest possible place

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So when my father passed
away, I found strength

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
like I never did,
and I prayed to God.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I can remember I just
let go of everything.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I forgot all the spiritual
doctrines that were in my head.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I let go of everything that
I've known my entire life.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I just let go.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.300 align:middle line:84%
If this had worked, this
wouldn't be the product.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:90%
This would not be the product.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I knew deep inside of me
that something was wrong.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
That and although I
was in this illusion

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that everything was perfect
in my spiritual life,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
because what the
practices did was build up

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
the ego up to a very, very
high level, so much so

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:90%
that reality gets distorted.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:90%
So I let go.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:90%
[DOG BARKING OFFSCREEN]

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: I just let go.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.611 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I just
prayed ernestly, and I said--

00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We have
a dog friend here.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.250 align:middle line:84%
That was actually during
the interview with Kirby

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.625 align:middle line:84%
it just, like, ran, and the
microphone and the camera all

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
went-- But that's part of life.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:34.337 align:middle line:84%
Enjoying And so at that
point, I just let go,

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:35.503 align:middle line:90%
and I just earnestly prayed.

00:08:35.503 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, God help me.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:90%
That's all I said.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:90%
God help me.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I just felt
let go, so I let go.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I let go of everything,
and I've never

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:90%
felt more free in my life.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
I felt so free,
like myself again.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.074 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
this is something.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
This is going to work.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I come
across Kirby by accident,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
purely by accident, which
is grace, of course,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
but in that consciousness I
thought it was an accident.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I came and I did
the seven-day program,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
and I joined his community.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And oh my god, I have
never ever felt freer

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
than I have-- I mean if--
This is the most freedom I've

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.494 align:middle line:90%
experienced in my entire life.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us how
you live life now.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
What is for you, I
mean, how-- because I've

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:84%
heard great things
about how things just

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
click from one things to the
next and how they evolve.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, how do
you-- where are you

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:90%
at in this consciousness?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
How do you live daily life?

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.865 align:middle line:90%
You pray?

00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:38.535 align:middle line:90%
You still pray?

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:41.485 align:middle line:84%
You still have conversations,
or it just happens?

00:09:41.485 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Now life
is completely turned over,

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:90%
180 degrees you would say.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm living now, I'm living and
enjoying and just letting go

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and just experiencing everything
and experiencing every moment

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
to the fullest that I can.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And the joy and the
abundance of the universe

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
is in experiencing everything
and not letting go of anything,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.870 align:middle line:84%
not choosing, saying this
is right and that is wrong,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
this is correct and that's
not correct, this is good

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
and that is bad.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Who are we to judge?

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.279 align:middle line:84%
We're just here to
experience and enjoy.

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm doing.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm experiencing,
and I'm enjoying.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Because judgment
brings condemnation.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And so we are not here to judge.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.749 align:middle line:90%
We were not put here to judge.

00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:24.070 align:middle line:90%
We were put here to experience.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, I mean,
my creativity has

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
flourished like it
has never before.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot even
say my creativity,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because I don't feel like it's
my creativity, to be honest.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I went in front of the people
that day, and I was thinking,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm
getting this award,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
but I don't really feel as if
I did anything, I honestly,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, because this--

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You didn't even
know how it happened, really,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
did you?

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: No.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.741 align:middle line:10%
It just gets downloaded.

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Show us that little
top, to give an example.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Because here we have the flower
of life on Gaiam TV you know,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:10%
so it's quite interesting
that you have this--

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.116 align:middle line:10%
you chose that one.

00:10:59.116 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:10%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:10%
This is from the
recent collection

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:10%
that I showcased at Colombo
Fashion Week last week,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:10%
and this got so much
of a-- such a response.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only designer who
was speaking of consciousness

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and God, and the music
was gospel and all that.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But still, and in a
country where 75% Buddhist,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:90%
the response--

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's
pretty bold, yeah.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.385 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
It was overwhelming.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Because it's who I am.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:84%
It's what I am, and I
need to be true to it.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So how can I live myself
otherwise, but only

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
by being true to myself, right?

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.359 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, OK, fine.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Even before I came
here, I told Kirby

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about immortality.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
life, because that's

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.274 align:middle line:90%
what my designs are about.

00:11:40.274 --> 00:11:41.231 align:middle line:90%
It's about immortality.

00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:90%
It's about life.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that
the universe is here

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.081 align:middle line:84%
to give everybody life,
that we are too concerned

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
about the negativity, that we
are too concerned about what's

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
wrong and not focusing on
what's right and what's amazing

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:90%
and what's beautiful.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
If we all get together and
put our focus on the positive

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and just take our heads
away from the negative,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
this world will just
change into being something

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
so amazing and so
beautiful simply

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:90%
because of the consciousness.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.304 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Yet you seem aware
of what's going on on Earth.

00:12:11.304 --> 00:12:12.845 align:middle line:84%
There's some challenges
and problems.

00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But you're-- it's not that
you're seeing all positive.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you're living
life without holding judgment

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying it, seeing love
everywhere in everything.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes, definitely.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not that I'm
living in my own little bubble.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: No, I don't feel
you're that way at all,

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I just want to
make this distinction so we can

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.795 align:middle line:90%
all understand.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I truly understand
that, you know.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But I also understand
that what you

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
see in life, what you
experiencing in life

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:90%
is what's in your heart.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
What you see around
you is what you

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
have within you that
gets projected outside.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So the most beautiful thing
is surrendering, surrendering

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, to
have its plan unfold.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That's what's been happening
to me for the last five,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:90%
six months.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, there's
this infinite faith, trust,

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:90%
joy, peace, complete peace.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And everything that you do,
it's complete synchronicity.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything just
falls into place.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you're
planning, you're working.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So the ego gets subdued,
but your life gets full on.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.840 align:middle line:90%
It gets magnified.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Life in itself gets magnified.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.345 align:middle line:84%
Life gets magnified in the
face when ego gets smaller.

00:13:30.345 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
always trying

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to think and control and
think that you're doing--

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's a lot of work.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Exactly.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.427 align:middle line:90%
And just let go and have fun.

00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm doing
with my designs.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.634 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm doing
with my creation.

00:13:40.634 --> 00:13:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm just following what
God tells me to do.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.004 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm doing.

00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing that I'm doing.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's what He does, and He just
tells me, do this, do that,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and I just do it.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.745 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Do you
receive downloads?

00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA:
Yeah, I see visions,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
sometimes open-eyed
visions, sometimes dreams.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I hear angels come and
talk to me and tell me-- I

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
hear voices saying, you
should do this, you should do

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:90%
that, things like that.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's like one word and
I need to decipher what it is,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.182 align:middle line:84%
but then I get the
message of what it is.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Some of
the new collection?

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.155 align:middle line:90%
Yes, including that.

00:14:12.155 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Things like that.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And colors.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:23.685 align:middle line:84%
I get images that I see, so it's
always downlo-- silhouettes.

00:14:23.685 --> 00:14:24.185 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It's mostly visions,
mostly visions.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And mostly what I see,
so even sometimes when

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.097 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to somebody, I
would see something right

00:14:33.097 --> 00:14:34.971 align:middle line:84%
in front of my eye, and
then you would see me

00:14:34.971 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:90%
like making a face.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
That's because I'm seeing
something else as well.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it gets transferred,
and then somehow it

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
manifests in the 3D as a
collection or as a garment

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
or as a design.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So everything is ordained
by the universe, basically.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything is planned, ordained,
executed by the universe.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And the fact that
you pray on this and you did it

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:84%
from that level of
awareness and of vibration,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:90%
it impacts automatically others.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are products,
those are like vibrations,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.155 align:middle line:84%
those are things that you put
out and then transforms others

00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Because we can all pretty much--
somebody baking bread can learn

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
from what you're going to
say, somebody interviewing,

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
somebody writing, somebody
painting, somebody babysitting,

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:90%
moming.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah, correct.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
I do is in prayer.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You could say that from morning
till night my entire day

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.835 align:middle line:90%
is in prayer.

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I have scriptures
going on in my head,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.979 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I
don't even know why

00:15:44.979 --> 00:15:46.644 align:middle line:84%
those scriptures are
going into my head.

00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, it's
just going in my head.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.135 align:middle line:84%
I can see it in
front of my eyes,

00:15:50.135 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's just
going into my head.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm always aware of the word.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the word that edifies me.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the word that
runs in my head.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And word is my
prayer, basically.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And when I finished
the collection,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:10%
I was asked by God to pray
over them, so I followed Him.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And I prayed over
them, and I prayed

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:10%
that the consciousness of the
ones who wear this will be

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:10%
elevated into a different
awareness all together

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:10%
and that God's plans or the
universe's plans would unfold

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:10%
and bring into
maximum frutation.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:10%
So if you're wearing
it, your consciousness

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:10%
would get elevated
so that everything

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:10%
that the universe wants to give
you would manifest completely.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes it can
get manifested 30%, 60%, 90%

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
in different variations,
but the most beauty

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.769 align:middle line:84%
is when we allow it to
manifest in its fullest.

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's a
whole other level.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah,
that's a whole other level.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey, again.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Trusting too.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It's believing.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:49.410 align:middle line:90%
It's trusting.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
It's faith.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Because without trust,
faith, or believing,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:90%
nothing would work out.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have faith
in you that this

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
would be an amazing interview,
it wouldn't work out.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:90%
It's faith.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have faith in
me, it wouldn't work out.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:84%
So same relationship that
we have in day-to-day lives

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is what gets transcended
into the relationship we

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
have with the
universe, the creator.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.575 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA:
I know it's hard,

00:17:12.575 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's invisible
most of the time.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.197 align:middle line:84%
But that's also the beauty
of it, the mystery of it.

00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it a mystery?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it a beautiful mystery?

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.874 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't have that
in a relationship or at work,

00:17:27.874 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%
do you transform that?

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.345 align:middle line:84%
Are you just being with
it until it transforms,

00:17:31.345 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
or do you think we can have
an influence, influence it?

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: You mean if a
relationship doesn't carry that

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.225 align:middle line:90%
vibration?

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:90%
If a relationship--

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Like whatever
relationship it is, at work,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:90%
romance.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
If a relationship
doesn't have it,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
so far it's been
pretty smooth sailing.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But there have been-- there are
situations where somebody would

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
have a different opinion
or would do something

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
that you don't think is
agreeable or whatever.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
But then what you
do again is rest.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Because just as you do--
Everything that I do

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:90%
is with rest.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't do things.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I rest, and God
takes care of things.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:10%
So everything is
rest, enjoy, have fun.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.652 align:middle line:10%
And so if somebody, okay, say--

00:18:15.652 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Let it be, kind of.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:10%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah,
and it works out.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:10%
Recently, one of my sewing
ladies, machine operators,

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:10%
she burned one of the outfits.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.630 align:middle line:10%
So she got so upset,
and she started crying.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:10%
I said, no, it's fine.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.460 align:middle line:10%
Don't cry.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:10%
I was pacifying her.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:10%
I said, don't worry.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:10%
It'll work out.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:10%
And we had run
out of the fabric.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, we
changed the design.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:10%
And I got this message from
God saying change it like this.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Do it like this.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was more beautiful
than what it was before.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So within the
negativity, if you rest,

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
there is something more positive
that comes out of it, if only

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:90%
you allow it to blossom.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
If only you have the patience
or the trust or the faith,

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
it blossoms into something more
magnificent and more beautiful

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:90%
than you could ever imagine.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I do.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.940 align:middle line:84%
If somebody says this
is right or this is not

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
right or disagrees with
me, I would say, OK, fine.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I would trust
God and just wait.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And God would work
things out in such a way

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that everything would
be just perfect.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: This is quite very
different than what we were

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:90%
brought up.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the case
for anybody living in the US

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.640 align:middle line:84%
or Europe or Sri
Lanka, apparently.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's very refreshing
to hear this point of view

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
being the same and consciousness
really expanding everywhere,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:90%
everywhere on this planet.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm thrilled.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we compare things,
one thing verses the next,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.707 align:middle line:84%
but this is unlimited, available
to all of us at any time.

00:19:48.707 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: And
that's what it is.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It's so ready to serve us.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
It's so ready to look after
us, take care of everything.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So why must we feel that
we need to do anything?

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Why must we?

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of the day,
we are all connected through

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
infinite energy, which, you
know, the 3D eye cannot see.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:90%
But we're all connected.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.909 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected
with each other,

00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
we're all connected
with the universe,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
and we are all part of that
one string that comes down.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So if what we can see is
from this plane of existence,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
but what He can see is from a
much higher level of awareness.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So if we trust that,
then the plan that

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:84%
is meant to unfold truly unfolds
in our lives and around us

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
in everything, in relationships,
marriage, money, finances,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
jobs, creativity, everything,
health, youth, vitality,

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
beauty, in everything.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
was that, I mean,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.132 align:middle line:84%
people cannot even
tell my age anymore.

00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It is
hard to tell, yeah.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.399 align:middle line:90%
How old do you think I am?

00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: I have no idea.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe-- I have no idea.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.256 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: I'm 35.

00:21:02.256 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be
in that range, yeah.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.989 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:09.780 align:middle line:90%
No, you're ageless.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.031 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:12.571 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I was
going to point there,

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.747 align:middle line:90%
but it's just an intuition.

00:21:13.747 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Because we can be intuitive too.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes, of course.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.255 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot say
from the outside.

00:21:18.255 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: No.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: You cannot
say from the outside.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's an
interesting thing, yeah.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.975 align:middle line:84%
We can't say it
from the outside.

00:21:22.975 --> 00:21:25.086 align:middle line:84%
It just has to come from
the heart, like intel.

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yeah.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: That's the
beauty of consciousness,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
because it changes
not only your inside.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It changes how you are
on the outside, how

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
your physical being
is, how everything is,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
your strength, your
vitality, your energy,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the way you look at
things, everything.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It transcends into
every level of you,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%
into every being of you.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Because most of
the time, I think

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
we're taught that
spirituality is different

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and life is different
and, you know,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
don't mix the two,
that kind of mentality.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:90%
But to me, it's seamless.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
It's seamless.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be separated.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Because how can
you be-- what you

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
believe in spirituality
is what gets transcended

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
into your work, into your
life, into your speech,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.785 align:middle line:84%
into your actions,
into everything.

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And if you be--

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe in
is life, life abundant,

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
life living to the
fullest, and life immortal.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So when I believe
in immortality,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that word in itself
carries so much energy

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that immortality gets
transcended into everything.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why two months to three
months later, I'm having awards

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and all this, because
immortality, it

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.850 align:middle line:84%
carries such a high vibration,
because it doesn't allow death

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.165 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:22:40.165 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But death doesn't
really happen anyway.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.209 align:middle line:90%
The soul goes through in spirit.

00:22:44.209 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA:
Yeah, that's correct,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but we don't believe
in that either.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.953 align:middle line:84%
We believe that the
bodies get transformed.

00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: That's the
revelation that we've been

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.726 align:middle line:84%
getting, that the bodies are
going to get transformed,

00:22:55.726 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that there's going to be a
new kind of human that's going

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to appear.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So my-- I don't believe
that I'm going to die

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and my soul is going
to get transcended.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe that my physical
body is going to--

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're not eating.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to eat.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going through this
whole breatharian thing.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't get hungry anymore.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel sleepy.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
of energy, right?

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And the physical body in
itself, the DNA in itself

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is transforming.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I've been given visions
of it as well since of late.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been seeing my
DNA being transformed.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And that DNA
transformation is what

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
gets translated into everything
else, because it's immortal.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:90%
So there is no way but up.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
There is no way for it
to go but everything

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:84%
to work out, because you are
putting life in its fullest

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
into everything, so
be it a relationship,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
be it to your marriage, be it
your job, your work, speech,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
beauty, anything, anything.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
perfection, because that's

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.310 align:middle line:90%
how God created us.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
That's how we are meant
to be, perfection.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
There has been some sort
of a backdrop in the past,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.796 align:middle line:84%
but perfection is
now manifesting.

00:24:06.796 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how soon
it will manifest,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:90%
but it is manifesting.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that much.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
been experiencing.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.345 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:24:13.345 --> 00:24:16.315 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that Sri Lanka is
at the forefront of something

00:24:16.315 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:84%
like that happening
in the world?

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Definitely.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.905 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I love it, because
with these interviews,

00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I get to have that
in every country.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I go to Mexico, I have it.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
I have it in France.

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's happening in France.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Paris, the heart.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the city of the heart.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.061 align:middle line:90%
And then I have it in Spain.

00:24:33.061 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:90%
So we have it in Sri Lanka.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.550 align:middle line:90%
There is a vortex.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's happening here.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes,
it's definitely Colombo.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.565 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yes.

00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Because the
revelations that Kirby's been

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
getting, the revelations
that we've been getting,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
the experiences-- it's
not just the revelations.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the physical
experiences that we've

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
been getting about it-- has
been so profound and so almost

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:84%
unbelievable, you could say,
because it's so different.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes even when I take a
step back, I'm like, oh my god.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's been such a crazy
journey up to this point,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's going
to get even crazier.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.286 align:middle line:84%
I know this is
just the beginning.

00:25:10.286 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I know it's going to
get even more crazier.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Even my business,
like the networking

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:90%
that I've been having is crazy.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
People from Australia who've
never even heard of me

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:84%
are calling me up
and saying, I want

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
to start selling your
garments in Australia.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting
people in the UK.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
kind of publicity

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.130 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of PR happening
in those countries, so

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.084 align:middle line:84%
how are they getting to
know about my designs?

00:25:33.084 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It's supernatural.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything in our lives that's
happening is supernatural.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.035 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this happens when
we do things through love,

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.200 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:90%
This is magic.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.579 align:middle line:84%
It's just really, it's, I
mean-- What I'm going through,

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:84%
what some people watching
here are going through,

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.181 align:middle line:84%
this is happening all
around the world, you know.

00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And I get that some people get
some download and everything,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's like it's
really happening.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
On an international
level, we're feeling this.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.417 align:middle line:90%
And it's quickening, huh?

00:26:01.417 --> 00:26:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:02.916 align:middle line:90%
It's quickening.

00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:90%
It's quickening very fast.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And love is the
basis of everything

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:90%
that I have just spoke of.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:90%
Love is the absolute basis.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:84%
If you say God, if
you say universe,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:90%
you could say it equals to love.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's all there is
at the end of the day.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:90%
That is all there is.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Even if you say immortality,
life, whatever you can call it,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:90%
that springs from love.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:23.995 align:middle line:90%
Love is the reason.

00:26:23.995 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Love is the main thing.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And love is why we
create or we do things

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or we speak or we
talk or we heal.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Whatever we do is love.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, I think
I'm not experiencing my love.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm experiencing His love.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And His love is something that
is far more profound and far

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:84%
more unique-- I'm getting
emotional-- unique and very,

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
very personalized.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So you say there's seven
billion people on this planet,

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how many
million or billion animals

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and trees and other beings that
you cannot see through the 3D

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
eye, but God loves each and
every one of them individually,

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
personally, beautifully.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And how everything in each
one of our lives transcends

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:84%
is because of the love,
right from conception

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:90%
up until to where we want to go.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, death only
happens because we want it,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:90%
because we prepare for it.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It's because God
gives us a choice.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you choose.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
You choose what you want.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And because you choose
death, death happens.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
If you don't choose death,
if you choose only life,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
if it's like, you know,
I want to live forever,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that's all that
happens in your life,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.418 align:middle line:84%
because that is
your consciousness,

00:27:40.418 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and God wants to give
you what you want.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking at it from
a personal point of view,

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.220 align:middle line:90%
God gives you what you want.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.084 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: And God is in us too.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: God is not
somebody who is external.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
God is somebody who
lives within us.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:90%
God is us, you could say.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why said,
I think I said

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:90%
before the universe is you.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So that is something
that is within you,

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:90%
that dwells within you.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.386 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I just
wanted to confirm that.

00:28:04.386 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Because same thing in Kirby's,
because it's always He,

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Him, Him, His.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The communication
doesn't go always through

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:84%
to understand that it's
also in us, so thank you.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.716 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:28:15.716 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
personal, because it

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is-- He is within you.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:10%
He's not somebody who is,
like, outside and standing

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and, you know
like, all whatever.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:10%
He is within you, and
He's within all of us.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:10%
It's just that if we are aware
of it, we are awakened to it,

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:10%
and then let Him do
everything within us,

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:10%
and then we don't let the
little I do things, that

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:10%
is the difference, the
difference between the little I

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and Him.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And let Him manifest
in us in everywhere.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you can say the
consciousness that I've

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.115 align:middle line:84%
been experiencing, the
creativity, the awards,

00:28:51.115 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:84%
the recognition, the orders
that are coming from overseas,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that is all Him
manifesting in my life.

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
That is me allowing
Him to take over.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's the ego
going down, resting

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
in God, who is within you,
and letting Him take over.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I look forward to
having this conversation in few

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
years time, you know, when
you'll be in New York.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
We'll maybe interviewing
in New York, no?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: I receive that.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I receive that.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.815 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Definitely.

00:29:17.815 --> 00:29:18.773 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: You got that.

00:29:18.773 --> 00:29:20.277 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:29:20.277 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: I received it for you.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.443 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:29:22.443 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We'll just be standing
there in one of your new--

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Shows.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.296 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Shows.

00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:27.656 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Definitely.

00:29:27.656 --> 00:29:28.547 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Or stores.

00:29:28.547 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes, why not?

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:90%
Stores.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's been a
pleasure meeting you.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.986 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, an honor.

00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRIBANDARA: It's been an
honor and a pleasure meeting

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
you, too.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.115 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, and God
bless you with everything

00:29:42.115 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:90%
that you want to do, everything.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Thank you.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.746 align:middle line:90%
I receive that.

00:29:46.746 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Big, big kisses to all of you.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.909 align:middle line:84%
And same for all beautiful
co-creators watching this, too.

00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:52.742 align:middle line:90%
>> KIRIBANDARA: Yes.

00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:54.717 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:29:54.717 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Thank you.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Big, big kisses from
beautiful Sri Lanka.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.405 align:middle line:10%
Bye bye.

00:29:59.405 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:90%
