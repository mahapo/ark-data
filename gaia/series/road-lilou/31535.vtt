00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:10.458 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
beautiful co-creators.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:10%
Lilou here in Yucatan in
Mexico at the Hotel Okaan

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the jungle, really,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.795 align:middle line:10%
really next to Chichén
Itzá with Lucy.

00:00:21.795 --> 00:00:22.595 align:middle line:10%
Hello, Lucy.

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:10%
>>LUCY ROMERO: Hello, Lilou.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Very, very happy to be
with you and the cameras

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:10%
and to say hello to
all your audience.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Well, thank you for
coming all the way from Mexico.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.145 align:middle line:10%
Because we're here in
this beautiful paradise.

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:35.645 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy that
I flew to France.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And here we are having this
conversation on consciousness,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%
this juicy conversation.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:10%
Because you're an author.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.553 align:middle line:10%
You were a TV host, too.

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you had what a life.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.775 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about your background.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Oh, yes.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know, life jumps
in a very unexpected way.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:10%
I began as a psychologist.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:10%
I am doing clinical psychologist
work for more than 30 years.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:10%
But suddenly one point of my
career, a friend of mine who

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:10%
was a director of an important
broadcasting radio station,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:10%
she asked me to make some little
capsules about the couple.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:10%
Because I have a major
in couple therapy.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:10%
So I began like this, and then
I jumped to international TV

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:10%
working for Univision in Miami.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:10%
And then I worked for
international radio, Caracol,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:10%
which is from Colombia.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:10%
So I am very happy.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And now I am in
there every Monday

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:10%
in radio, W Radio,
radio 96.9 FM.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:10%
And I am very happy, because
working for the radio

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:10%
and for media is a way to spread
through many, many people that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.690 align:middle line:10%
could never reach a
private consultation.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.563 align:middle line:10%
That's why I love
to work for media.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah, and there's so
much to talk about with you.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.715 align:middle line:10%
Because your website
is actually in Spanish.

00:02:06.715 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But thanks to
Google Translate, I

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
got to see a little
bit of your work.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to discover it
as everybody is going to listen

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.620 align:middle line:90%
right now to this conversation.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
But you talk about the goddess.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:84%
We could speak about so
many things, the couple,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%
the goddess, jealousy.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But I really would love to
speak about your heritage.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you're wearing
this beautiful outfit.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we're here
really in Mexico.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We're really here
where the Mayans are

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and there is so much history.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about--

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Well, I love
this kind of costume

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:10%
because it belongs to Oaxaca,
one of the most creative places

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:10%
in the country.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's hand-embroidered.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, everything that
people are looking at

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:10%
is hand-embroidered.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And it means-- it is kind of
a expression of femininity.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:10%
And here at the Mayan
place, which is Okaan.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Okaan is a gorgeous
place because it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:10%
very close to Chichen Itza.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:10%
And this land is
empowering for women.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:10%
And why it's empowering
for women, because they

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:10%
said that, in
Mesoamerican cultures,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:10%
they said that if the
woman could deliver

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:10%
a baby in this part
of the country,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:10%
the baby will be blessed.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:10%
Because all the
southeast of the country

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:10%
is ruled by a very,
very strong goddess.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:10%
And its name is Ixchel.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.170 align:middle line:10%
So any little boy or girl born
here was absolutely blessed.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:10%
And why this land is so
important, because meanwhile,

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:10%
this is the southeast
of the country

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:10%
is the first part
of the country that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:10%
received the sun all year long.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:10%
So the sun is raising and
coming into the country

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:10%
through these lands.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And these lands are
extremely feminine.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So any woman who comes
here feels gorgeous.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.115 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I love that.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this place also
brings up some stuff in us.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.805 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Absolutely.

00:04:13.805 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It's part
of the process.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: it's part of the
process, and mainly in Okaan

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:10%
because Okaan is a very special
place because it's built

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:10%
inside, inside the jungle.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult that
you have so much facilities

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:10%
inside the jungle.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the jungle was
absolutely preserved.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:10%
So jungle is something
that the first two

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:10%
days has to embrace you because
of the sounds, the smell.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:10%
Some are much little crickets
in the night that awake you.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:10%
But at the third day,
you feel like blossoming

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:10%
from inside to outside.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.650 align:middle line:10%
So that's why you feel like--

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:10%
sometimes when I
do workshops here

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:10%
I prefer to allow all the
audience and the students

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:10%
to really relax and do some
meditation and vegetarian

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:10%
food before we begin
with whatever we have.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:10%
Because they have to adapt
themselves to the jungle.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:10%
The jungle has to embrace you.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And you have to relax in it.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then that that it
happens, miracles comes up.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I know you speak
a lot of the serpent, too.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We had this conversation.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into it.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.185 align:middle line:84%
What does the
serpent inspires you?

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Oh, well, one
of my bestseller books

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:10%
is We Are Goddesses.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And We Are Goddesses,
I made an analysis

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
what's happened with the
symbol of the serpent.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Because for Mayan
culture, serpent

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:10%
is a wonderful, very,
very strong and wonderful,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:10%
meaningful symbol.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.220 align:middle line:10%
And for the Christians
there is evil.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:10%
It is the sin.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:10%
It is the sinner the ones
who are close to snakes.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.840 align:middle line:10%
So it was like,
in my mind, what's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:10%
going on with this strong symbol
that is the snake, the serpent?

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent is a very
powerful symbol for all women.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:10%
Because all around the
world, not just in Mexico--

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:10%
let me tell you,
the Sumerians, they

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:10%
have a strong
feminine figure that

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:10%
has in both hands the snakes.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:10%
Because the snake was
a symbol for wisdom,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:10%
was a symbol for
medicine, was a symbol

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.670 align:middle line:10%
for death and life
and recovering.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:middle line:10%
You know that some snakes,
they change their whole--

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:10%
the transformation in the
middle of their lives.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:10%
They change the skin.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:10%
So it's a very deep
symbol for we women.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:10%
Because there is a
moment in women's

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:10%
life in which we have
to transform ourselves

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:10%
as a butterfly or as a snake.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.993 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two symbols
of transformation for women.

00:07:04.993 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So what's
the difference,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
you would say, transforming
into a snake versus a butterfly?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: OK, the snake just
take her own skin and leave it.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's very interesting,
because if you see it

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:10%
in the jungle, sometimes
you can find it.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:10%
And you feel-- you
see even though it's

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:10%
totally transparent.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:10%
It's like if the
skeleton goes down.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And then she recovers and
has a second life, too.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:10%
And the butterfly is a
total transformation.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:10%
It's from the caterpillar
that the caterpillar,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:10%
it is a point in her life that
she really intoxicates herself

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:10%
with her own products, and from
that builds up like a cocoon.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:10%
And we women need
to have a cocoon

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:10%
once in our life, a cocoon
to make the transformation.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
come the imaginal selves.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:10%
Imaginal selves
are the self that

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:10%
has the power and the project
of being totally, totally

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:10%
different, 100%.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moment in
which we women are all

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time for women to
really be what we had never

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:90%
been before in our memory.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because the societies who really
have the empowerment of women,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
it was in 1200 before
Christ in Crete,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:90%
the Minoic Creta in Greece.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
last civilization

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
who has a clear balance
between man and woman.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:10%
They worked together
deciding and proposing.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And later on, woman
was devastated,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
because the barbaric
tribes who came and killed,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
they really were very, very
afraid about feminine power.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So they call us, which
is they call us a malady.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:90%
They call us that we are cursed.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:10%
And then they put
our symbol of power,

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:10%
who was the snake, as the sin.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then they took the virgin,
just the virginal woman,

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was the one who
was going to step

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:90%
into the head of the serpent.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:10%
But why the serpent, the
snake, turns into that poison

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:10%
kind of symbol, it was
because the power of the women

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.000 align:middle line:10%
must be defeated.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you see all around the
world there are many men who

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:90%
are afraid of feminine power.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And this is not the clue point.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The clue point is that men
recover inside themselves

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:90%
their own feminine energy.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we do have, as a woman,
we do have masculine energy.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:10%
And they do have
feminine energy.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:10%
So we have to
allow them to arise

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:10%
their own profound
feminine energy

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and embrace it as a woman
and then recover our way

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:36.726 align:middle line:10%
to speak aloud our voice, which
is the change for the world.

00:10:36.726 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: When does
that transformation

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:90%
take place in one's life?

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Well, it is
sometimes after 35.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Between 35 and 45, we women
went into that transformation.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I like-- did you see
that movie about Alice

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
in Wonderland, the
one of Tim Burton?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.440 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: OK, this is a perfect
story about the transformation.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:10%
It's so beautifully described.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:10%
Because he altered a little
bit the original script

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:10%
of Lewis Carroll.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:10%
And he turns it into a profound
story about this girl who

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:10%
doesn't want to be what
her mother and her society

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:10%
push her to be and
meant her to be.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:10%
And then she ran.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, she
found the little rabbit

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:10%
and went into the rabbit hole.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:10%
And then it comes
the phrase, how deep

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:10%
do you want to go
into the rabbit hole?

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:10%
Which means, how deep do you
want to go into your own story,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:10%
into that big question
that the caterpillar-- you

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:10%
remember the caterpillar in the
movie that says, who are you?

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:10%
And she drives mad.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:10%
She cannot answer "who am I?"

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.966 align:middle line:10%
until the end of the story,
which is just beautiful.

00:12:12.966 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how long are
we ready to go deep inside?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Is this journey a must for
one's liberation or one person

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:90%
to live fully?

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Is it one journey
that really takes

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a long time and that
is meant to go really

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.562 align:middle line:90%
deep, and a bit scary, yeah?

00:12:29.562 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Well, I think
that each woman has--

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:10%
more than liberation, more
than freedom, is awakening.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Awakening the power.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And the power is not a
power of confrontation.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:10%
It is not like the feminist.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:10%
I adore the feminist woman.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.390 align:middle line:90%
But I am not one of those.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew that
they really confront

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
very difficult and strong
society in which woman

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:90%
was really pulled down.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And for many, many centuries,
more than 1,500 years,

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
if you were born as
a woman, your destiny

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely craft.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:84%
You cannot change
anything on your destiny.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:10%
But now I could say, since the
half part of the last century,

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:10%
at least in Occident-- because
in Orient, I am really sorry,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:10%
but they are still
suffering very, very much

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:10%
a patriarchal destiny that we're
collapsing the feminine energy.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But now we in the West, we
really can improve ourselves.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:90%
How far?

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
As far as we
allowed it to do it.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Is that journey also,
for you, part of going back

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:10%
into our own ancestors?

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I guess
it's been going on

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:90%
for generations and generations.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.870 align:middle line:90%
So how does that work?

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes, well--

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.307 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Can we
release that much?

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Absolutely.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:10%
The psychological studies
about the fields, the fields

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:10%
that are--

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:10%
this is the systemic psychology
that is running in the top now

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that belongs to
transpersonal psychology

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:10%
and has a strong base in physics
and a strong base in biology

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:10%
with Rupert Sheldrake
kind of work.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And then we know
that we really have

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:10%
to be very grateful
to our mothers

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:10%
and grandmothers and
grand-grandmothers' ancestors.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:10%
But say, I love
you, I respect you,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:10%
but I am willing to
take my own destiny.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:10%
So I am asking you to bless me.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:10%
Because I am not
going to be like you.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:10%
I am not going to take the
decisions that you took.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:10%
And now I fully embrace my
era and the destiny of the era

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:10%
that I was born.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:10%
But thank you very, very much
from the deepest of my heart.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:10%
I honor you, all my ancestors,
all my women ancestors.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.366 align:middle line:10%
Because of you I am now here.

00:15:27.366 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Beautiful
act of love, huh?

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Yes, yes.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:10%
And each one of us has to do it.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.860 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter--

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Men and women, here?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Absolutely,
men and woman,

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:10%
we have to do it
if we really want

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:10%
to develop a society in which
we can make decisions together

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:10%
and we can develop
another kind of view

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:10%
for society in which we are
not so prompt to have the rat

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:10%
race of power and the
rat race of totally

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:10%
competition and confrontation.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:10%
We are more like
bounding and honoring.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter who you are.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter
what do you do.

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:10%
I know that what you
do and what you are,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:10%
it is perfect because
it's part of the creation.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:10%
But I, myself, too--

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter if my work
is to prepare some sandwiches

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:10%
in the morning for the
children, or to wash dishes

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.640 align:middle line:10%
in a restaurant all
day long, or if I

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:10%
am a very high scientific
woman or a leader or a writer

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:10%
All women deserve the same
honor, and all men, too.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.662 align:middle line:10%
But we have to make
that kind of change.

00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:10%
I have to tell you something.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.100 align:middle line:10%
The other day I went to a
very important congress here

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico, in Puebla.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:06.619 align:middle line:10%
And one of the lecturers, a
very strong and intelligent man,

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:10%
I asked him, what
would we women have

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:10%
to do in order to
make our voice to be

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:10%
listened in the scenarios that
take decisions for the world.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:10%
And he said, this is one of
the most important things.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:29.285 align:middle line:10%
If we really want, that
society makes a jump,

00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:10%
makes the quantum
leap, to really

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:10%
offer to the next
generations something better.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:10%
And I really enjoy that a man
so strong and powerful and wise

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
like him said something so deep.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Because it means that even
in the very high circles

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:10%
of thinkers, they know
that the feminine arising

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:10%
of the energy in men
and women is absolutely

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:10%
required if we want to
go further in evolution

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:10%
for society, for human society.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And I hear a lot--

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:10%
so the forgiveness is a big
part of this, a big chunk

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:10%
in this process of evolution.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:90%
What are the different things?

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:84%
What are the different
components for our society,

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
do you feel, to go
from this patriarchal

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.145 align:middle line:90%
to this more feminine energy?

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Well,
the first part is

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:10%
to acknowledge and to
recognize that for 3,000 years

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:10%
we had been collapsed
and imposed.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:10%
And there are many, many
places around the world

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:10%
in which the machismo or
the patriarchal society

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:10%
are still very, very
violent against women.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.780 align:middle line:10%
Daily we have noticed
in news around the world

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:10%
in different media that takes
care about what is going

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:10%
on with violence against women.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:10%
So we have to overcome that.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.685 align:middle line:10%
The first part, I would say,
is like a kind of cleansing.

00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: A cleansing, yeah.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: A cleansing,
like a cleansing of,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:10%
I am going to say
yes, it happens.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:10%
You cannot go over a perpetrator
if you jump over saying

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:10%
forgiveness, if you don't
first say, I am looking at you,

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:10%
and I am telling you
that it happened.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:10%
And once that we
can do that, then we

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:10%
have the strength to
allow ourselves to speak.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:10%
Because what's
happened is that--

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:10%
I've been working 30
years with a lot of women

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:10%
around the country and
in different countries.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.050 align:middle line:10%
And what I've found is that
if you confront them and say--

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:10%
OK, listen, tell me
what do you want--

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:10%
they paralyze.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.805 align:middle line:10%
They are not that sure
of what they want.

00:20:11.805 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody has
asked them before.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:10%
What we have to be and
to do was pre-designed

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:10%
before we were born,
the expectation.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:10%
So now that we
have that-- that's

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:10%
why we are going in
pendulous kind of movements.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.470 align:middle line:10%
We jump from one
part to another part.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:10%
What for?

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Because we are trying
to find our own center.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:10%
And once that we are
centered, then we

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:10%
can say, OK, now I have
to articulate the language

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.800 align:middle line:10%
to say and to express
what do I want.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:10%
Not in a confrontational way,
not in a very rebellion way,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.690 align:middle line:10%
because this is
the same old thing.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:10%
So we're not going to go
anywhere if we are just

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:10%
going in that line.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:10%
So we have to
articulate a language.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And once a woman is centered
in her own being, I mean,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:90%
it's so authentic.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Lilou, it is amazing, amazing.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:10%
When I have a circle of
women and I allow them just

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:10%
to express themselves
after a cleansing,

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.050 align:middle line:10%
I am bowing in front of them.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:10%
There is so much wisdom.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:10%
Even the woman that is the
cleaning woman in your house,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:10%
she has so much wisdom.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:10%
Because she's a mother.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:10%
She fed with her breast.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:10%
She carry in the nights
the fever of the children.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:10%
So the only thing is to
allow them to be authentic

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:10%
and to say, it's
fine to be authentic,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:10%
and I am here to listen to you.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.143 align:middle line:84%
To listen to you, what
are your feelings?

00:22:17.143 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:10%
What are your desires?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:10%


00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:24.047 align:middle line:10%
That kind of opening,
that kind of bowing.

00:22:24.047 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So it's great,
because then you give them

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:90%
also the opportunity to speak.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of the process.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Or do we have--
because sometimes we

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:90%
need the permission, huh?

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to give ourselves
that permission, isn't it?

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Yes, that's
why we need first

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:10%
to let out the anger.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:10%
First, you have to go,
to cross over submission.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:10%
Because submission is
the first reaction.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:10%
In my book, We are
Goddesses, I talk

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:10%
really deep about
that, for a long time,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:10%
we women are a
second class society.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:10%
And when you have a second class
society for a long, long time,

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:10%
it comes like second skin that
people cannot overcome easily.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:10%
So we have first to
rest and to allow

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:10%
them to overcome submission.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:10%
Then will come rebellion.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.010 align:middle line:10%
And then from rebellion
and submission,

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:10%
then it comes into
a very authentic way

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:10%
of allowing themselves to
express something different,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:10%
something that is not
in the environment.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when we women really
join together and make

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:10%
serious proposals, we're talking
from another different point

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:10%
of view.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:10%
That we don't have a memory
that it had happened.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:10%
And now I am feeling that is an
opening in different scenarios.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:10%
Like entrepreneurs all
around the word-- well,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:10%
not all around the world,
but at least in the West--

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:10%
you see that entrepreneurs and
directors in big enterprises

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:10%
are at least 50% women.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:10%
And the same in science, in art.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:10%
So you have different
scenarios in which

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:10%
women are flowering, emerging,
and doing their own thing.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.975 align:middle line:10%
And then people are turning.

00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:46.760 align:middle line:10%


00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, not in politics.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:10%
In politics, we still
have small places.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:10%
And there are just few
countries around the world

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:10%
which had a president or a
first minister as a woman.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.110 align:middle line:10%
But I think that we are in a
very, very good position right

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.990 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: There is also,
I guess, not this anger,

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:10%
but there is something to
be released in the process.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:10%
And women are very
intuitive, right?

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.470 align:middle line:10%
And we feel things.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it might
be difficult to make

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:10%
the difference between our
intuitions and the past things

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:10%
that we have lived or inherited
from past generations.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:10%
So how can we make
the difference

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:10%
of how to know what's really
good for us in the end,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.298 align:middle line:10%
and how to make the
right decisions,

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:38.590 align:middle line:10%
and that we're not-- sometimes
we feel crazy, don't we?

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.632 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we have the
hormones, everything working.

00:25:40.632 --> 00:25:41.466 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:41.466 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Well, let me tell
you, first, it is just 20,

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:10%
25 years ago that
intuition is not

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:10%
related with madness
or hysterical process.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:10%
So we have to acknowledge that.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:10%
We have to acknowledge that
now the word intuition is

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:10%
welcome in different kind of
talking and serious talking.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:10%
And you could say,
I have a hunch,

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:10%
and people could pay attention.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:10%
But for a long time,
you have a hunch,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:10%
you are stupid because
you cannot have a reason.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Intuition is to know without
knowing why you know.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:10%
So it could be very close
to craziness or stupidity

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:10%
from the Cartesian
kind of thinking--

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:36.220 align:middle line:10%
very, very going to the
point and from A to B to Z.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.320 align:middle line:10%
And then, if you use
it your intuition,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:10%
you go from A to Z. Yes,
and nobody understands that.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So now that we can
say, I have a hunch,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and then some people
could say, yes, OK,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear your hunch,
what it's all about.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they keep an eye on--
they look if it works or not.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.930 align:middle line:10%
And now we are allowing
ourselves to go further.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:10%
For a long time, to say
something like that,

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:10%
it was like you deserve to
be burned in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
You deserve to be in a jail.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:10%
You deserve to be
treated like a witch.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a heretic thing to
do by the Inquisition.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:10%
So those are very, very deep,
hidden scars in your heart,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:10%
in women's heart.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.310 align:middle line:10%
Because we have our own
heritage for our mothers

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:10%
and grandmothers and
fathers and lineage.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:10%
But we have the
unconscious memory

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:10%
that is a cellular thing.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:10%
And these cellular
things jump and pop up.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:10%
I work with women who, even
though their fathers were

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:10%
very nice and their
husbands or colleagues,

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.970 align:middle line:10%
when they have a big boss that
jails them, they paralyze.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:17.450 align:middle line:10%
And their heart again, bumping
like this, and they paralyze.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:18.620 align:middle line:10%
And they cannot act.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:10%
And they feel in the throat
there is like a kind of knot,

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:10%
and they cannot
articulate the language.

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is not because
their own story.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't have
that in her childhood.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But because it's a
memory for ancient times

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:90%
that we have in ourselves.

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.730 align:middle line:10%
So we have to overcome all this.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that men will
be very happy for that.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:10%
Because they are tired, too.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:10%
They are tired of
being just the heroes

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:10%
or being just the one who has
to carry on everything in terms

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.008 align:middle line:10%
and in order.

00:29:00.008 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: They're
probably tired, too,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
of having bossy women
that are so masculine

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and running them around,
which is not really

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:90%
the nature of woman.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel the
nature of woman

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine is the
receiving and the beingness

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of roundness.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.830 align:middle line:10%
Yes, well, what you
are talking about

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:10%
is what in Jungian
psychology would

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.270 align:middle line:10%
call that animus possessed.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:10%
Animus possessed is a
woman that is unconsciously

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:10%
possessed by the masculine
energy of her own psyche.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:10%
So she performs like a
man, but she's a woman.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.540 align:middle line:10%
So in doing that,
she feels powerful.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:90%
She feels strength.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But deep, deep down, she
is never happy with that.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in long-term, she cannot
have true men close to her.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.490 align:middle line:84%
She will have a man
that she submit.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are kind
of obedient to her.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:10%
But this is around fear and
being threatened by the woman.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
overcome from that.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:10%
And the attributes of
the feminine energy

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.800 align:middle line:10%
for all the world,
not just for women,

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:10%
is beauty, is
sensuous, is elegance.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the Mayan
culture is so elegant.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Women here are so powerful.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:10%
You see them so
strong, so well-seated

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:49.130 align:middle line:10%
with these beautiful costumes
and with her face so elegantly

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.163 align:middle line:10%
happy and proud of themselves.

00:30:53.163 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: They had their place
yesterday, I saw a ceremony.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was exactly that.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They were just really
as present as men were.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes, yes.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It was a
big deal ceremony,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were there
just doing their thing

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and doing their
prayer and bringing

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.335 align:middle line:84%
in the incense
and the cleansing.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Yes, it is an
experience of a deep balance

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:10%
between the two energies
and then is like expanding

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:29.480 align:middle line:10%
of the heart, having some
kind of deep feeling of--

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to
say trust or hope,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:10%
because it's something
that is already there.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
we are going to achieve.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is already there.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.760 align:middle line:10%
We just have to turn to see that
kind of relation and to say,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'm going to take it for me.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to
go deep inside of me

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
and to do what I have to do.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I need therapy, if
I need Reiki, if I need tarot,

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:84%
if I need to go to university
and have a degree, if I just

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.910 align:middle line:84%
need to spend some time in the
middle of the jungle like this

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
in Okaan, I am going to
do whatever is required.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to die as a
woman living somebody else's

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.280 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Because two centuries ago, they
decided what a woman should be.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:10%
It's that kind of
empowerment that we need,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:32.270 align:middle line:10%
and then to join, to
join in a good mood

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:10%
and in a good side
with another woman.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Because you know
something, Lilou?

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, the
biggest enemy for a woman

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:10%
is another woman,
for a long time.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Because we were-- and it
is very understandable

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:10%
from the psychological
point of view.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:10%
Because if you belong to
a second class society,

00:32:53.930 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:10%
then you have to go in like this
to have a little bit of breadth

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.350 align:middle line:10%
into the first society.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.560 align:middle line:10%
And if you have to step
over the shoulders of one

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:10%
of your colleagues that is
a woman and take her work

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:14.970 align:middle line:10%
and put it under your name,
you're going to do it.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise you don't want
to belong to the second class

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.140 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's the things that
we have to really be aware.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why I talk about
a process of awakening.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.415 align:middle line:90%
It's a process of awakening.

00:33:29.415 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How do you picture
that process of awakening?

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Is that just like from the
heart emanating and opening up,

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.320 align:middle line:90%
or is that--

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:90%
how do you visualize it?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.570 align:middle line:90%
How can we see it?

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:45.660 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: I visualize it like
saying to yourself, first,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:10%
what you don't want
anymore in your life.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't want violence,
don't tolerate violence,

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:10%
and don't be violent.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:01.050 align:middle line:10%
If you don't want to
relate with somebody--

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.150 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter who
is that somebody-- that

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:10%
jails you, that criticizes
you, you don't deal with that.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
You say, I am going
to do whatever

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I have to do to be over that.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:90%
But you have to do the same.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.889 align:middle line:10%
You cannot ask for good
daily treatment and you being

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:10%
a bitch, threatening
people, bitchy kind of, OK?

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.350 align:middle line:10%
So first, you have to
do something like that,

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:10%
which is a very difficult step.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:10%
And second, you have to be
productive for yourself.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Because there is a trilogy that
men, that patriarchal society,

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:10%
are using to control women
since 3,000 years ago.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:10%
The first is sex.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:10%
They controlled our
sex for a long time.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.639 align:middle line:90%
The second is money, economy.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And the third is logos.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:10%
Logos means that we women for
a long time thought that we

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:10%
cannot understand the world if
it is not by the words of a man

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:10%
or men that explain
the world to us.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So the world has meaning
as long as a men tell

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:90%
you what is the world.

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:10%
Because we were so devastated
in that terrible time

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:32.460 align:middle line:10%
that the barbaric
orgs exterminate

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:10%
the balanced society.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.640 align:middle line:10%
It is very well written
in a book that I adore

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.640 align:middle line:10%
and I recommend to
everybody who is listening.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It's "The Chalice
and the Sword."

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's by Riane Eisler.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.480 align:middle line:10%
She's a terrific writer.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:10%
And Marija Gimbutas,
she did a terrible work

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:10%
talking about societies that
were different than the one

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.830 align:middle line:10%
that we are living now.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why now
we are in the time

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that these kind of
societies are as strong.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:10%
So these three ways
of controlling us,

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:10%
sex, we overcome sex
when we have the pill.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.515 align:middle line:10%
So the pill allowed us to have
sex without the risk of being--

00:36:21.515 --> 00:36:22.515 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Oh, the period.

00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I heard "the peel."

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.368 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: No, the pill.

00:36:26.368 --> 00:36:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Oh, the pill, the
pill, the contraceptive pill.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>>ROMERO: Yes, the
contraceptive pill.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Because before,
every relation, you

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.700 align:middle line:90%
have the risk to be pregnant.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:10%
And if you are
pregnant, you could die.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.610 align:middle line:10%
Because I mean, a lot of women
died before the penicillin,

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:10%
the penicillin and the
aseptic environment

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:10%
around the delivery room.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:58.860 align:middle line:10%
A lot of women died
from a puerperal fever.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.370 align:middle line:10%
So we women had a lot of fear
that get pregnant easily.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:10%
So the liberation,
the freedom of that,

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.350 align:middle line:10%
became with the
contraceptive pill.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.080 align:middle line:10%
The second is the money.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
Men still now control
women with money.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:10%
Because why?

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.460 align:middle line:10%
Because we need the money
to feed our children.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And if we don't have
the experience of I

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:10%
am strong enough to produce
my own living, which

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:34.590 align:middle line:10%
happens to a lot of
women around the world,

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.880 align:middle line:10%
then they control by
the power of money.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.160 align:middle line:10%
And the third,
which is the logos.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.070 align:middle line:10%
Now we women are allowing
ourselves to say, hey,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.960 align:middle line:10%
may I raise my hand?

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:10%
I have an opinion.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:90%
But it was not that way.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.970 align:middle line:10%
Remember Schopenhauer saying
that women are creatures

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:10%
with long hair and short ideas.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:10%
And Schopenhauer, one of
the biggest philosophers

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.240 align:middle line:10%
of the last part of the century.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So much-- not damage,
but there is a lot of, then,

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:10%
when we hear that, you're
like, oh my goodness.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:10%
It raises a lot of
thoughts and a lot of--

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:10%


00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:10%
as you said, we cannot move
forward with the same way that

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.750 align:middle line:10%
things have moved
forward right now.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So really the intuition
is one of those tools.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.755 align:middle line:90%
And what else?

00:38:38.755 --> 00:38:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Intuition--

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:41.815 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Forgiveness--

00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Intuition first.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:10%
Second, acknowledge our state.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:50.440 align:middle line:10%
Third, give an honor
to our ancestors.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And then understanding
that patriarchal society

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:10%
has good points, too.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:10%
Because they gave law.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:10%
They gave the structure.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.880 align:middle line:10%
They gave a science.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:10%
They gave technicians.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:10%
But now it's our turn.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.930 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's not
something that now we

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:10%
are going to devastate
the whole-- no.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.190 align:middle line:10%
On the contrary, we
are going to step on

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:10%
for building a new society.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:10%
So I think that each woman
has to do their own path.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.650 align:middle line:10%
And the ways are
always, always at hand.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:10%
There is no woman
that really wants

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:38.650 align:middle line:10%
to awake that could not step on
her own toes and turn her head.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:10%
And then things will arise by
synchronicity, by intuition,

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:10%
by reading, by
friends, by programs

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.700 align:middle line:10%
like yours that all
the time are talking

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.960 align:middle line:10%
about all these new
evolution, and by the joining

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:10%
of the heart in the project
of developing a new society.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:10%
But new society begins
with each one of us,

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.820 align:middle line:10%
then with your couple,
then with your children.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:10%
If you can rescue
this little self,

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:10%
then you will rescue
the whole society.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.370 align:middle line:10%
Don't think to jump in big,
big, big, massive scenarios

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:26.095 align:middle line:10%
if you do not begin
by your own selves.

00:40:26.095 --> 00:40:27.895 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Loving ourselves, huh?

00:40:27.895 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Loving
ourselves and allowing

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.140 align:middle line:10%
ourselves to express and
to go through whatever

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:10%
it is required.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:10%
Because Lilou, we
are going to die.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's wonderful that we
are going to die and confront

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:10%
our own death with a smile
and say, oh, you know,

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:10%
I took from life everything
that belongs to me--

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:10%
everything--
everything including

00:40:54.490 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:10%
suffering, pain,
but joy, but bliss,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:06.246 align:middle line:10%
but experience, and
laughter and dance.

00:41:06.246 --> 00:41:08.290 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You're a Mexican woman.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure all women
listening to this can relate.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a global society.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Transformation is
happening everywhere.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that there is
something special that Mexico

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
is bringing that this
land or this earth--

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.160 align:middle line:84%
I heard often it's
the [SPANISH]..

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But do you have
something to say?

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Absolutely.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:10%
We have to understand
that this country has

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:10%
the most powerful kind
of ancient sanctuaries

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.410 align:middle line:10%
all around the world.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:90%
If you take--

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I already did it.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:10%
If you take the
map of the Republic

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:55.990 align:middle line:10%
and you just point a little,
little point in all the centers

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:10%
that are around the country,
it will come full of dots.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.820 align:middle line:10%
Pyramids are from the center
to the southeast, covering.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.200 align:middle line:10%
I went to the museum.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now we have in Madera
a marvelous new museum.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:10%
It is a museum for the
ancient Mayan culture.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful
architectural building.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you go there, there
is a map of the peninsula.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:10%
And they put yellow light,
and when you push the button

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:10%
and you see the light, you
say, I cannot believe that.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the government
has not enough money

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:44.390 align:middle line:10%
to discover and to take the
jungle from all the pyramids.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.480 align:middle line:90%
But we are full of pyramids.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.680 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yet the richest man
on the planet is Mexican.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Oh, yes.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So there is, there is--

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Yes, there
is a lot of energy.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:10%
And now is like, I once had a
kind of dream, an image that I

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:10%
saw each one of these
pyramids around the country

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:13.665 align:middle line:10%
was bumping bumping,
palpitating.

00:43:13.665 --> 00:43:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And when the Tibetan culture
was destroyed by the Chinese,

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.750 align:middle line:10%
it was like it was a flip-flop.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Because the Tibetans
was a culture

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:35.160 align:middle line:10%
that has 1/3 of their own
population praying and living

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:10%
in monasteries.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:10%
But when they were
devastated in '59,

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:46.890 align:middle line:10%
when His Holiness the Dalai
Lama went to India to Dharamsala

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:10%
to be as a refugee because
President [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:10%
allowed him, it was
like a collapsing

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.910 align:middle line:10%
off of a very important
pole in the equilibrium

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:10%
of the energies, the spiritual
energies of the whole planet.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:10%
And now this is making a
flip-flop that comes from

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.070 align:middle line:10%
the Patagonia, goes to
Peru to Machu Picchu,

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:10%
and then comes to all the
Maya entrance from the Central

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle line:10%
America--

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.930 align:middle line:10%
Belize, Honduras, Guatamala.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes to Chiapas
Quintana Roo Yucatan.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:33.910 align:middle line:10%
And then it comes to
Campeche and to Tabasco.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And it covers part
of Mitla in Oaxaca.

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:44.980 align:middle line:10%
So all this part of a very
strong energy is pulling up--

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Kundalini
of the earth, is

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.510 align:middle line:10%
that what you're referring to?

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Uh huh,
that's what they say,

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:54.360 align:middle line:10%
that this is the
Kundalini of the earth.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:10%
And now they have very
strong discoveries

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:10%
in the center in Mexico
City, the Templo Mayor.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:07.380 align:middle line:10%
The Templo Major was the
hidden part of the Aztecs

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:10%
that the conquerors, the
Spaniards, destroyed the top.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.180 align:middle line:10%
And on the top of
it, they built up

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:10%
the big Zocalo and the great
cathedral that we have.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:25.500 align:middle line:10%
But in the last 20
years, more and more

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:10%
of the Templo Mayor are coming.
and what we are discovering

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.810 align:middle line:84%
is amazing, including the
beautiful Coyolxauhqui.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And Coyolxauhqui was that
goddess that was thrown out.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And she splitted in her body.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.310 align:middle line:10%
But the legend said
that there will

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:10%
be a time in which Coyolxauhqui
will recover her members,

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:10%
because her legs and
arms wide were broken,

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:10%
and she will recover.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.675 align:middle line:84%
And all are those myths of
recovering the feminine.

00:45:58.675 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That's the
question I had earlier.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you said that.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Because calling forth
for that goddess,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
right, is part of
also what we can do?

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.400 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone in this process.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess we can ask
her for some help.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROMERO: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And we have this strong figure
here in Yucatan that is Ixchel.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.640 align:middle line:10%
And Ixchel-- I am a fanatic of
stories of the different kind

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.020 align:middle line:10%
of goddesses around the world.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:10%
Because one of my training
was for a long time

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:10%
to study Jungian psychology.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.700 align:middle line:10%
And Jung was the
one, the first one,

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.210 align:middle line:10%
who made a parallel with
the mythological part

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:43.710 align:middle line:10%
of the cultures around the
world and the life itself

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:10%
of his own patients.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And there is a kind of therapy
that we do with mythical.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:10%
We call that mythical parallels.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And one day I was talking
with one very important

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:10%
Canadian psychologist.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And I asked her, I would
like to study the pantheon

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.070 align:middle line:10%
from the Greeks.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And she said, don't do that.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.050 align:middle line:90%
You're Mexican.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to study
the Mexican pantheon.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:10%
And Ixchel is one of
the strongest women

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.610 align:middle line:10%
representatives,
because she goes

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:24.080 align:middle line:10%
from the very young girl,
six, seven years old,

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:10%
until the elder.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So she makes a conjunction
that we have splitted.

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:39.960 align:middle line:10%
In Greek mythology, we have
Hera and we have Persephone.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:10%
And we have Demeter.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:10%
But in Mexican culture, for
the Mayas, we have Ixchel.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:10%
And Ixchel has the
whole pantheon.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's very easy
to just Google it.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: How do you spell it?

00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:57.915 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Ixchel is I-X-C--

00:47:57.915 --> 00:48:01.020 align:middle line:90%


00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I have to write it
down to spell it.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Ixchel, Ixchel-- OK,
I-X-C-H-E-L, Ixchel.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:10%
When she is young,
she is like a student.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.260 align:middle line:10%
And she learned how to
handle all the elements.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.950 align:middle line:10%
She knows how to
handle the water, how

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:33.190 align:middle line:10%
to prepare the healing
power of the herbs,

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:40.610 align:middle line:10%
and how to work with the skin
of the animals, the feather

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:49.640 align:middle line:10%
of the beautiful birds, and
how to work with the stones.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:10%
One of the main stones in
that part of the country

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.950 align:middle line:10%
is turquoise.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:10%
And they heal with jade
and with turquoise.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.640 align:middle line:10%
So she is a master
during her childhood

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:10%
until she's around
35 or something.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:10%
Then she turns into the
most magical, seductive,

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.150 align:middle line:10%
beautiful woman.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:12.390 align:middle line:90%
She's powerful.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:90%
She's sexy.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:20.600 align:middle line:84%
She can perform all type of
sex with all type of men, yes.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have the Lacandon
sex rites, which

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.310 align:middle line:90%
are a tantric thing that--

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:33.080 align:middle line:84%
one day we will make
good with Alberto.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.735 align:middle line:10%
He knows a lot about
Lacondon sex rites.

00:49:36.735 --> 00:49:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That's another video,
my beautiful co-creators.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.648 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes.

00:49:40.648 --> 00:49:42.065 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We could
speak for hours.

00:49:42.065 --> 00:49:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Yes, my dear.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And then let me close
Ixchel with you.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.960 align:middle line:10%
And then once she passed
over all this period,

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:10%
a woman of being very sexy
and very seductive and very

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.950 align:middle line:10%
beautiful.

00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:00.120 align:middle line:10%
And she dresses with all
kinds of feathers and pearls

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.310 align:middle line:10%
and whatever she puts on
her body, everything just

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:12.170 align:middle line:10%
to beauty, beauty that every
man could go on the floor

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.280 align:middle line:10%
just to see her.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So thank
you so much, Lucy.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.400 align:middle line:10%
It was so amazing meeting you.

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.190 align:middle line:84%
We could do this for
hours, couldn't we?

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROMERO: Oh, yes.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.970 align:middle line:10%
We women, when we open our
heart, it happens, Lilou.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And I am so happy that
finally this was a destiny.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.190 align:middle line:10%
Because we couldn't meet
five years ago, and now

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.330 align:middle line:10%
it comes into turn.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.160 align:middle line:10%
So I am very, very grateful to
you and to all your audience,

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:39.960 align:middle line:10%
absolutely.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.637 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And you write
many, many books.

00:50:41.637 --> 00:50:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And you have your website.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you remind us of
that so that people

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.348 align:middle line:84%
that want to search more of this
deep knowledge that you have?

00:50:47.348 --> 00:50:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you have so
much information.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I love when women really you
have all this information.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.183 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible to listen to.

00:50:55.183 --> 00:50:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>ROMERO: Oh, thank
you very much.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:08.810 align:middle line:84%
My website is
www.lucyromero.com.mx.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And don't forget the mx, OK?

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:13.880 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And you can always
use Google Translate.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.492 align:middle line:90%
There is always that option.

00:51:15.492 --> 00:51:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in Spanish,
your website, for now.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>>ROMERO: Oh,
thank you very much

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:23.150 align:middle line:10%
that you advise me to do that
Google thing into English.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.780 align:middle line:10%
I will be doing as soon
as I arrive to Mexico.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:27.658 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:51:27.658 --> 00:51:28.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Thank you, Lucy.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.242 align:middle line:84%

>>ROMERO: Big kisses,

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Bye-bye.
