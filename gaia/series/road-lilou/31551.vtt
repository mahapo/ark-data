>> Hello my delicious

on the road, I'm in
Japan, I'm not in Europe,

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:19.353 align:middle line:84%
I just actually landed in Japan
and we had this amazing symphony

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of peace prayer here at
the foot of Mt. Fuji.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.627 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely delicious
and the world leaders,

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:28.129 align:middle line:90%
some

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:30.164 align:middle line:84%
of the religious...religions
were represented

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:84%
by different leaders and
I have here next to me,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.871 align:middle line:84%
Mughal who is representing
the Sufi...Sufi Islam Sufi.

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:40.708 align:middle line:84%
>> And its...so we're going
to have this conversation,

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:47.014 align:middle line:84%
I really was very excited,
moved, inspired in tears

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:84%
to see all the different
religions,

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:53.320 align:middle line:84%
at least 8 of the different
religions walk on stage.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the emotion it was
like a dream coming true,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.294 align:middle line:84%
I can't even explain
what...tell us

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.698 align:middle line:84%
about this interfaith
and what it creates.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually you know that
I'm living in Japan more

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:84%
than 28 years, so my dream
was you know to bring peace

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.908 align:middle line:90%
in the world through Japan.

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:17.445 align:middle line:84%
Because Japan is a very
peaceful nation and I think

00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:19.113 align:middle line:84%
that they are very
opened minded people

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:22.616 align:middle line:84%
so they can do...they can
accept all kind of religions,

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:26.353 align:middle line:84%
they don't have any mistake,
misunderstanding about it,

00:01:26.353 --> 00:01:28.155 align:middle line:90%
they respect all religion,

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:31.058 align:middle line:84%
so that's why you know I have
been doing about 28 years

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
as my mission but from last
5 years this SOPP is one my

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.669 align:middle line:84%
friends, her father and mother
are doing this [inaudible]

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.538 align:middle line:84%
as she was yesterday,
so they asked me

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.709 align:middle line:90%
to join as Islamic Sufi pray.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.346 align:middle line:84%
Then I came here and we brought
this all religion is Christian,

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Judaea, Hindu, Sikh
so all religions

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:90%
from the world pray together.

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.521 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is the prayers
are a very important thing

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
to bring peace in.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.526 align:middle line:84%
So that's why started this and
you [inaudible] and we did it.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel there is some
component to good prayer?

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, actually as the
religion is come from God

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.938 align:middle line:84%
and God teaching every
religion to pray.

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:21.275 align:middle line:84%
There is no religion without
pray, so frees the essence

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:23.577 align:middle line:84%
of the religion when
somebody pray you can feel

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:26.313 align:middle line:84%
that how much is
a peaceful mind.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:28.549 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I taught
that religion is,

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.184 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
is several kind

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
of religion it's
like music, you know.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.957 align:middle line:84%
Do, Ra, Me, Fa, So, La, Te, Do,
if only one, if I'm the only one

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.426 align:middle line:90%
that best there is no music.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:42.963 align:middle line:84%
But when you get Do, Ra, Me,
Fa, Christian, Islam, Judaism,

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.899 align:middle line:90%
whatever all come pray together,

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.034 align:middle line:84%
so this is an symphony
of free spirit.

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:50.671 align:middle line:84%
You get the symphony, you get
music but [inaudible] is nothing

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.007 align:middle line:84%
so now is the time to
bring together people

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.343 align:middle line:84%
and make harmony
and loving peace.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:03:00.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Um, definitely there was this
communion beyond...can we say it

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
was beyond the religions
or how do you describe it?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually not beyond the
religion but first you have

00:03:06.587 --> 00:03:09.256 align:middle line:84%
that religion, if you don't have
religion you can't see beyond

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.758 align:middle line:90%
the religion, you know.

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:14.028 align:middle line:84%
But people...a lot of people
that don't have religion anymore

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
so we don't force on the
people that you should follow

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.233 align:middle line:84%
or you strictly believe
in this religion no,

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.569 align:middle line:84%
first of all come
and pray with us.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.339 align:middle line:84%
When you pray then your spirit
will get a little bit holy

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and feel like I am something and
step by step the people get near

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.647 align:middle line:84%
to God and that religion,
you know works with them.

00:03:33.647 --> 00:03:36.483 align:middle line:84%
That's why in a way a lot of
the religious people that come

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.118 align:middle line:90%
in they're praying but I feel

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:41.255 align:middle line:84%
that the religious
leaders are praying

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:90%
but their nations are fighting.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.592 align:middle line:90%
This is a conflict.

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:46.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.962 align:middle line:84%
>> So this why I feel
something bad so better

00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:50.731 align:middle line:84%
to bring the best
image of the religion.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.465 align:middle line:84%
Now religions are
the best thing,

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.368 align:middle line:84%
right now people have no
[inaudible] of fighting,

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:57.671 align:middle line:84%
this is a bad thing, It's not
good, I think that's wrong.

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about
your view on Sufism.

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually Sufism, you know
when I was 11 years old,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.385 align:middle line:84%
in Sufism we pray same like as
a usual Muslim five times a day

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:13.821 align:middle line:90%
but, plus we do meditation.

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:16.991 align:middle line:84%
So there's many kind of
groups, some groups are dancing,

00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.326 align:middle line:84%
some groups are focusing
on the music,

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:23.931 align:middle line:84%
so some people are focusing on
the poetry but in my kind of,

00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:84%
you know Sufism we call it
specialism is a meditation.

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.604 align:middle line:84%
Get up early in the
morning before 5 o'clock,

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:35.042 align:middle line:84%
30 to 40 minutes of silence
to make my mind empty,

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:38.846 align:middle line:84%
then when mind is
empty the spirit of God

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.516 align:middle line:84%
and it will make you
holy and inspiring you

00:04:42.516 --> 00:04:44.184 align:middle line:90%
to create something new.

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:45.886 align:middle line:84%
So this is very,
very special thing

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:48.522 align:middle line:90%
but to have hardship to do that.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us more about the
kind of mediation you practice

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.927 align:middle line:84%
since a lot of people that
are watching all the videos

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:57.731 align:middle line:84%
on GAIAM TV are already
practicing or watching or,

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:84%
you know doing yoga
and all these things,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.436 align:middle line:84%
how would you describe
your kind of meditation?

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:06.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually you know mostly
I was reciting, go around,

00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:09.643 align:middle line:84%
we call it azan every morning
in the five o'clock...four

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.413 align:middle line:84%
to four-thirty, to first
of all to get up early

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:13.947 align:middle line:90%
in the morning is the best way.

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.983 align:middle line:90%
This is the first step to;

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:18.252 align:middle line:84%
you know to fight
with your sleeping.

00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:20.888 align:middle line:84%
So people cannot get...it's
very hard to get up early

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:24.792 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, so before
sunrise you have to get up early

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:90%
and before praying you know.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.328 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
own way of praying,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
go ahead it doesn't
matter how do you pray

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:84%
but before pray make your
mind holy with your holy mind

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:90%
when you pray it will work.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:38.739 align:middle line:84%
So mind is actually we
have a lot of worries,

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:41.175 align:middle line:84%
we have you know early
in the morning or I have

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:44.878 align:middle line:84%
to pay my debt, I have to
pay...buy me car, I have to meet

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:49.917 align:middle line:84%
that person, a lot of worries,
I call that a lot of host

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:54.021 align:middle line:84%
of worries are pulling your
mind so you are be drawn

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:57.091 align:middle line:84%
by the very worries of
false worries you know.

00:05:57.091 --> 00:06:01.295 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 [inaudible]
working with your mind.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.997 align:middle line:84%
These could destroy you so
that's why we are not peace

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:07.234 align:middle line:84%
in the mind so how to cut
off all these worries.

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.703 align:middle line:84%
So the cut off all
these is not easy job.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning maybe 10 20
minutes it will take hardship

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
but when you get worried empty
mind then the real meditation

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.312 align:middle line:90%
will start.

00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:20.514 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will be silent
and you can listen the voice

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:25.486 align:middle line:84%
of small insect, small, small
voices are coming to you...

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:29.857 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God maybe you can see
the ways of leaves, trees,

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:31.525 align:middle line:90%
natures are coming to you

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:33.927 align:middle line:84%
and I feel oh my God
I didn't realize a lot

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:35.429 align:middle line:90%
of voices are [inaudible]

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:39.533 align:middle line:84%
so this is the real
symphony of harmony.

00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:44.037 align:middle line:84%
The nature have the harmony but
our minds cannot feel that so

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:45.572 align:middle line:90%
when you feel the nature inside

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.208 align:middle line:84%
of you oh really you
get more peaceful mind

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:51.745 align:middle line:84%
and then God spirits, high
level spirits come to you

00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:55.649 align:middle line:84%
and you inspiring and after that
you pray, that pray would work.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.319 align:middle line:84%
That whole day will get
more special, more exciting,

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.889 align:middle line:90%
more happy, this is the way.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:04.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Um, tell us about
your outfit,

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
tell us about the different
components and how is

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.062 align:middle line:90%
that related to your religion.

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:11.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually you know religion,

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:14.368 align:middle line:84%
Islam is okay everybody is
practicing say like five days,

00:07:14.368 --> 00:07:17.638 align:middle line:84%
me too, but you know [inaudible]
these special things come

00:07:17.638 --> 00:07:20.474 align:middle line:84%
to my work; actually
I'm [inaudible].

00:07:20.474 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So I am a TV commentator
you know in Japanese

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.279 align:middle line:90%
and been to a lot of TV shows.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:29.383 align:middle line:84%
So when my mind is empty
and I'M very inspiring early

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:31.685 align:middle line:84%
in the morning I
do very good show.

00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:35.255 align:middle line:84%
Presently I'm doing very good
talk with you, same like that,

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.592 align:middle line:84%
this work too you know
it's effect on your work.

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:41.495 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to write...oh what I

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:44.198 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:47.501 align:middle line:84%
I meet people really
I give new ideas.

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.004 align:middle line:84%
I'm business man, I'm very
old I do good business,

00:07:51.004 --> 00:07:53.507 align:middle line:84%
I'm carpet dealer, you know

oh a lot of customer
comes in I can sell them

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:84%
so this whole get very happy
but if my mind is not set

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:04.585 align:middle line:84%
up customer comes to you,
not handling them with love,

00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:08.555 align:middle line:84%
not you giving attentions,
it will be destroying mine.

00:08:08.555 --> 00:08:11.391 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the best
thing is to make your mind

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:14.728 align:middle line:84%
and body unity, the unification
of your mind and body,

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:17.164 align:middle line:90%
it works and people get happy.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.499 align:middle line:90%
>> And related to the costume?

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, related to the costume
actually it's time for pray,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm using...actually this is one
of my friend's from royal family

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.277 align:middle line:84%
in Saudi Arabia so
he came to Japan.

00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:33.814 align:middle line:84%
I was...because I'm doing
interfaith talk show

00:08:33.814 --> 00:08:36.149 align:middle line:84%
so I invited them, highly
religious these people

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:37.651 align:middle line:90%
around the world in Japan.

00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:41.855 align:middle line:84%
So he brought this gift for
me, he said no it suits you.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:46.693 align:middle line:84%
Inside is my Pakistani
dress but this is from Arab

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:48.195 align:middle line:90%
so [inaudible] I got it.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:49.696 align:middle line:90%
So I love this [inaudible]

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.198 align:middle line:84%
because we believe
this is a holy land,

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:52.699 align:middle line:90%
Saudi Arabia is a holy land,

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:84%
this is actually the Arab
religious clothes...costume

00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:01.775 align:middle line:84%
so I feel it holy, you know what
I mean I [inaudible] pray it

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:06.146 align:middle line:84%
so when I get this turban from
Pakistan, inside is Pakistan,

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:09.082 align:middle line:84%
out is come from
Saudi Arabia it's all

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:12.653 align:middle line:84%
like this religious what
did you say clothes.

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:14.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:15.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Will make you
more comfortable

00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:17.157 align:middle line:90%
when you do religious things.

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:18.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, how about that
because I'm wearing

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.561 align:middle line:84%
as you can tell the ucata
which is not the kimono

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.265 align:middle line:84%
but It's called the ucata
and you're wearing this

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:28.635 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of...it's not like
we're playing roles but it kind

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:30.137 align:middle line:90%
of creates some fun,

00:09:30.137 --> 00:09:31.638 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's something
else that happens, uh?

00:09:31.638 --> 00:09:33.539 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes maybe...how
do you feel now,

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.209 align:middle line:84%
you feel your spirits get
a little bit Japanese?

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.645 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel very centered.

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:42.916 align:middle line:84%
>> So this costume...you
know in my philosophy I feel

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.886 align:middle line:84%
that if you're an army
soldier you're going to fight

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.487 align:middle line:84%
with this clothes,
you cannot fight.

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:51.992 align:middle line:84%
When doctor is going
to cut your body

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:56.496 align:middle line:84%
and having the soldier uniform
what will happen...oh It's scary

00:09:56.496 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
so every work, every
job needs the uniform

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.071 align:middle line:84%
so this is our uniform
for spiritual work.

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.275 align:middle line:84%
When you're in suit you're
doing it as a business man,

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:12.346 align:middle line:90%
so this is our uniform.

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:16.483 align:middle line:84%
>> [Inaudible section] tell us
you know what...I love the word

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:18.518 align:middle line:90%
oishi; I think life is oishi;

00:10:18.518 --> 00:10:20.554 align:middle line:84%
this is how you say
it in Japanese.

00:10:20.554 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about the consciousness

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.258 align:middle line:84%
and how you see we're
all related

00:10:25.258 --> 00:10:27.995 align:middle line:90%
and interlinked with each other.

00:10:27.995 --> 00:10:32.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually you know this whole
human being, when I get married

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:36.169 align:middle line:84%
with you definitely the children
are born as a human being,

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:41.241 align:middle line:84%
not monkey, not a lions,
so you know the human being

00:10:41.241 --> 00:10:44.945 align:middle line:84%
when connected to each other
they create human being,

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.613 align:middle line:90%
not an animal.

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
God created us because he's
a God so what does he feel,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:84%
he created, he created the
children of God not physically

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:58.091 align:middle line:84%
but he don't have the shape,
he don't have the body

00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:02.195 align:middle line:84%
but he create...we are the image
of God, you are the female image

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.464 align:middle line:84%
of God and I'm male
image of God.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
When we unite, when
we love each other,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.837 align:middle line:84%
when we combine we create
another children of God,

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.241 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I believe that
all humanity even white, black,

00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:16.309 align:middle line:84%
yellow, whatever,
Indian, Pakistani,

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:19.179 align:middle line:84%
Jewish whatever we're all
human beings, we are brother

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.381 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, we are
the one family.

00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But of some due to
this political thing,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.888 align:middle line:84%
due to material desires
we are disconnected

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:30.557 align:middle line:84%
and then we make our own
countries, your friends,

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:34.261 align:middle line:84%
I am Indian, you are Pakistani,
a lot of borders comes.

00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.229 align:middle line:84%
So where do these borders come
from, it's from the human mind.

00:11:36.229 --> 00:11:38.632 align:middle line:90%
Because there is a border

00:11:38.632 --> 00:11:41.101 align:middle line:84%
in the mind that's why we
say no I don't want you,

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:45.372 align:middle line:84%
I want to be separate from you,
this kind of tension is coming

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.675 align:middle line:84%
and we are making you know
troubles around the world.

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:51.812 align:middle line:84%
So my purpose is just back
to a reasonable position,

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.947 align:middle line:84%
let's go back and
make peace mine

00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:57.918 align:middle line:84%
and let's unite together
with the God loves.

00:11:57.918 --> 00:12:00.954 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that last flag
was the flag of the earth?

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes so there was

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:08.195 align:middle line:84%
about 196 countries we have
been praying to each flag

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:11.398 align:middle line:84%
but final flag is
the flag of earth.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.469 align:middle line:84%
Because the earth is our
mother, we born from this earth.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.638 align:middle line:84%
You know when I was children
I can give you this message,

00:12:18.638 --> 00:12:21.141 align:middle line:84%
very important, I learned
from my father you know,

00:12:21.141 --> 00:12:23.977 align:middle line:84%
as a father we're
reborn where we come from

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:27.047 align:middle line:84%
and what are we doing here
and where we are going.

00:12:27.047 --> 00:12:29.182 align:middle line:84%
Is three questions,
this is very easy,

00:12:29.182 --> 00:12:34.321 align:middle line:84%
it says when you are a child
you're born from mother and then

00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:36.289 align:middle line:84%
from child you go
to the young age

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:38.792 align:middle line:84%
and from young age
you're going to be old.

00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.927 align:middle line:84%
So when you're a child you
don't know what is young,

00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.997 align:middle line:84%
what is a youth, what is the
feeling of young, the energy

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:46.399 align:middle line:84%
and the love passions,
this you have

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.069 align:middle line:84%
to be experience, I
cannot explain you.

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is no philosophy, no
teaching so when you are young

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.177 align:middle line:84%
or adult you will feel that...oh
this is young, I am young man.

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:59.913 align:middle line:90%
When finally you got to that old

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:03.617 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot feel what is
the old, ask your grandmother,

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.153 align:middle line:84%
she knows what is old,
how much she is suffering,

00:13:06.153 --> 00:13:08.955 align:middle line:84%
how much she has pain in
the knees, how she pains,

00:13:08.955 --> 00:13:12.392 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pains, old person
has a lot of difficulties,

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:16.229 align:middle line:84%
this is...you cannot understand
and they cannot explain to you.

00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:18.431 align:middle line:84%
So you have to experience
what is the old,

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:22.369 align:middle line:84%
when you get old you will
understand...oh my God I am too

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:24.604 align:middle line:90%
old, now I can't do anything.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:28.375 align:middle line:84%
This is what then after this
then you are going to die.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:84%
So what is the death, you
have to experience first.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.549 align:middle line:84%
Other wise you can't say, so
there is an old philosophy

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:40.287 align:middle line:84%
of death, what is that...first
try death you will know that,

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:43.023 align:middle line:84%
what [inaudible] father,
there is some word

00:13:43.023 --> 00:13:46.059 align:middle line:90%
after death, that's my question.

00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:48.461 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was so genius
when I was 11 years old

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.264 align:middle line:84%
so my father yes you're right
I'm going to give you the answer

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:53.633 align:middle line:84%
of death, there's
a spiritual world

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.468 align:middle line:84%
after die we go to
the spiritual.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:14:01.208 align:middle line:84%
I said where we go, just
think when you was old

00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:04.544 align:middle line:84%
that you was young
and then before young

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.848 align:middle line:84%
when you was a child
and before child yes,

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:12.953 align:middle line:84%
I was baby in the stomach
and before baby I was...oh

00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:16.623 align:middle line:84%
that is the question,
before baby you was blood,

00:14:16.623 --> 00:14:18.925 align:middle line:84%
blood of mother, blood
of father and mixing

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:21.161 align:middle line:84%
and getting creation
of children.

00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:24.431 align:middle line:84%
Where does this blood come
from now...oh I see this come

00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:29.836 align:middle line:84%
from food, we eat and blood
comes and we become body,

00:14:29.836 --> 00:14:31.338 align:middle line:90%
that's okay and then food

00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:33.473 align:middle line:84%
where it comes from,
it comes from earth.

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So that where we came from
earth, the earth is our mother,

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.381 align:middle line:84%
we was physically,
biologically born by earth.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But I said to my father it's
okay I understand but what

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
about this inside light, he
says yes the spirit comes

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.523 align:middle line:84%
from spirit, spiritual world
so we are the combination

00:14:50.523 --> 00:14:53.627 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world
and spiritual world

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
so spiritual world
light come from God

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.934 align:middle line:84%
so when we are 5 years old we
have the light of 100 watt,

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:04.237 align:middle line:84%
and the 500 watts will be
getting, growing, growing

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but it depends on you, you
have to charge it, it's depends

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.409 align:middle line:84%
on your battery, how much
you have strong battery.

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:13.713 align:middle line:84%
Where this light come from
God and body come from earth,

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:18.685 align:middle line:84%
when we die the body will go
to the grave and spirit will go

00:15:18.685 --> 00:15:20.186 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual world.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:23.123 align:middle line:84%
This is the mechanism of
human being, if you understand

00:15:23.123 --> 00:15:26.226 align:middle line:84%
about this mechanism you will
not worry, you are not afraid

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.561 align:middle line:84%
of anything and you
will be more happy.

00:15:28.561 --> 00:15:31.197 align:middle line:84%
>> When you received the
inspiration you said you were

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:35.935 align:middle line:84%
meditating and it just
comes...how does it feel like

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:39.406 align:middle line:84%
and where is this...you're
saying it's coming from God,

00:15:39.406 --> 00:15:42.042 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from the
universe could we say?

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:45.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can say that...you
can say...nobody has seen the

00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:47.781 align:middle line:84%
God you know, there
is no image of God,

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
everybody has their own image
of God, It's really more simple,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.021 align:middle line:84%
it's a nature but it is a very,
very high power, it's a light.

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:58.658 align:middle line:84%
You can see the size that's
why we call it enlightenment

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:02.195 align:middle line:90%
of the human being is a Sufism.

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:05.565 align:middle line:84%
Sufism is enlightenment;
spiritual enlightenment

00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:08.034 align:middle line:90%
of the human being is a Sufism.

00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:09.536 align:middle line:90%
Sufism is enlightenment,

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:11.504 align:middle line:84%
spiritual enlightenment
of the human mind.

00:16:11.504 --> 00:16:14.007 align:middle line:84%
So when your mind if light
you can see everything.

00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:16.443 align:middle line:84%
You know when you are
in the darkness and get

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:18.845 align:middle line:84%
in the room you will be you
know hitting many things

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:21.848 align:middle line:84%
and getting hurt and
you will get big problem

00:16:21.848 --> 00:16:24.184 align:middle line:84%
but when you have light
inside of the mind you

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
where is my chairs are
putting, where is my camera,

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.421 align:middle line:84%
there is no light
but there is light

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:84%
in your mind you know your
room, you easily enter it

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.928 align:middle line:84%
without light because
you are so confident.

00:16:34.928 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The best kind of
confidence come to you

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.532 align:middle line:90%
through this enlightenment.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.368 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you define
enlightenment because a lot

00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.571 align:middle line:84%
of people on earth are looking
and searching for enlightenment,

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
there's many different religions
among souls who are praying

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
in the monasteries or
seeking that enlightenment,

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.481 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama also most
likely in many people,

00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:58.651 align:middle line:84%
even us ordinary people we
have moments of enlightenment

00:16:58.651 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
without maybe even praying

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.522 align:middle line:84%
or having [inaudible]
religious practice.

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:06.593 align:middle line:84%
>> The easiest way to
start you know get up early

00:17:06.593 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:90%
in the morning before sun rise

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.264 align:middle line:84%
because this light
will be destroy you

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:14.233 align:middle line:84%
so we need the spiritual
light, this is very important

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that you should be
balanced with the nature.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:18.938 align:middle line:84%
So at that time the
light is very beautiful,

00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:22.575 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you before
sunrise, one hour is beautiful

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.844 align:middle line:84%
at [inaudible] and go
to the silent place

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:27.347 align:middle line:84%
where you cannot listen to
any other destroying music

00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:31.017 align:middle line:84%
or light motor bike or car,
it will destroy your mind.

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:34.687 align:middle line:84%
Get in the mountain because
I living near to the sea,

00:17:34.687 --> 00:17:36.689 align:middle line:84%
I'm seaside and I can
listen to the waves

00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:38.391 align:middle line:90%
of sea, that's no problem.

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.926 align:middle line:90%
I can hear it and I can get it

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:42.061 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes mountain
is the best,

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:46.533 align:middle line:84%
go and make your life same
life style or what easy

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:51.838 align:middle line:84%
for you just sit down and trying
to nothing...trying to nothing

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:84%
but this is very hard,
you know a lot of worries,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.843 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things are in
your mind, I have to do,

00:17:56.843 --> 00:18:00.647 align:middle line:84%
I have to pay my bank, I have
to meet my father, I have to go

00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:03.616 align:middle line:84%
to Japan, my visa...lot
of worries are there

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:06.152 align:middle line:84%
so t his is hundred
kind of worries.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:09.522 align:middle line:84%
I call it this hundred kind
of...hundred horse powers

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle line:90%
worries are pulling your mind,

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.093 align:middle line:84%
that's destroying
your mind you know.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:15.361 align:middle line:84%
That's why we cannot
get enlightenment.

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:19.632 align:middle line:84%
When this all your clutter
then your mind will be free

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:24.537 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel that okay try
to listen the ways of nature.

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:28.842 align:middle line:84%
Don't speak by such...people
are praying...their wording okay

00:18:28.842 --> 00:18:33.046 align:middle line:84%
and like yesterday I also
praying with wording is okay

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:35.448 align:middle line:84%
but I think that's
your religious pray,

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:84%
in Hindu the call it mantra,
we call it azan or [inaudible]

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:43.957 align:middle line:84%
or [inaudible] a lot of these
are song singing, that's okay

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:49.095 align:middle line:84%
but in meditation needs
nothing this is only empty mind.

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.765 align:middle line:84%
When your empty mind get and
you can listen to the ways

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:56.102 align:middle line:84%
of nature, the small
insects or flowers

00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:59.639 align:middle line:84%
or birds oh it's too
much beautiful harmony.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:02.575 align:middle line:84%
Then after then you can
pray by your own religion,

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:06.479 align:middle line:84%
you'll be more satisfied with
your pray, this is my way to do.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.147 align:middle line:84%
>> In the world other
people speak

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.783 align:middle line:84%
of the sacred feminine
coming back, how does it feel

00:19:10.783 --> 00:19:14.287 align:middle line:84%
for you being from Islam,
how do you hear that?

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:15.788 align:middle line:90%
>> The sacred what's...

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.524 align:middle line:84%
>> The sacred feminine,
the feminine,

00:19:17.524 --> 00:19:19.792 align:middle line:84%
like it was a very
patriarchal society

00:19:19.792 --> 00:19:24.364 align:middle line:84%
and now the society needs
more of the female values,

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:25.865 align:middle line:90%
how do you feel about that?

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:27.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see, I see, I see...

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.868 align:middle line:90%
>> You heard of it.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:31.771 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a little
bit I heard of it,

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:35.475 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you it's
depend on your spiritual mind,

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:39.012 align:middle line:84%
the people that somebody hasn't
experienced the love of father,

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:45.084 align:middle line:84%
love of mother so what is it
they're looking for some love

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:48.121 align:middle line:84%
so this kind of love for
example I'm telling you I'm not

00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:50.223 align:middle line:90%
so familiar with Christianity.

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:54.227 align:middle line:84%
It's happen the first time to
the Jesus Christ that he pray

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:56.229 align:middle line:84%
and he feel that the
Holy Spirit comes

00:19:56.229 --> 00:20:00.266 align:middle line:84%
and they get the female
spirit and Jesus was there

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
and female spirit comes
[inaudible] called the Holy

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.674 align:middle line:84%
Spirit, that kind of
philosophy I can understand it

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:12.045 align:middle line:84%
because God is like you
know...God is not like us,

00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:14.747 align:middle line:84%
not like a human being but
he is all kind of passion,

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:16.249 align:middle line:84%
all kind of passion,
all kind of love,

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:18.551 align:middle line:84%
so people if they are
looking for the love of mother

00:20:18.551 --> 00:20:22.855 align:middle line:84%
like a female spirit it will
appear and people can feel

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:26.859 align:middle line:84%
like that, they got plenty
[inaudible] in Christianity,

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:30.763 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people I can see this
is all the Holy Spirit is a

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:34.634 align:middle line:84%
female spirit and we are blessed
with that, it sometime happen.

00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Even sometimes the
male spirit also come,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.706 align:middle line:84%
so in my case you know
because I believe it's

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:43.876 align:middle line:84%
like my father was spiritual,
my grandfather was spiritual,

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:47.847 align:middle line:84%
I feel that the God spirit
is like a male spirit to me

00:20:47.847 --> 00:20:51.851 align:middle line:84%
so that's why you know I work
with the spirit so I feel

00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.187 align:middle line:90%
that he loves me, I love him,

00:20:54.187 --> 00:20:58.258 align:middle line:84%
so this kind of...you know I
can understand that feeling.

00:20:58.258 --> 00:21:01.094 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay and the mother earth.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Mother earth, yes.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.864 align:middle line:90%
>> She's feminine.

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:08.034 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I'm telling you
that's what this...mother earth

00:21:08.034 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
you can say feminine and heaven
is the male, male and female.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Father sky, mother earth.

00:21:15.141 --> 00:21:18.211 align:middle line:84%
>> Father sky, mother land, yes
but this is the balance of that

00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:84%
because you know our
body come from you know,

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.781 align:middle line:90%
we born from this,

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:25.451 align:middle line:84%
it's a biology [inaudible] would
say it's [inaudible] becoming a

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle line:84%
human being before we was any
[inaudible] maybe it can works

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.893 align:middle line:84%
but [inaudible] is not important
the main thing is you are

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.395 align:middle line:90%
in your spirit.

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:90%
How you develop your spirit.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:42.168 align:middle line:84%
>> But we have very much
prayed and have a connection

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:46.406 align:middle line:84%
to this Holy Father and I feel
that there's a dis-imbalance

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:48.107 align:middle line:90%
with the mother earth you know

00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:50.777 align:middle line:84%
so that recreates...because
we don't really respect her.

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:54.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean here in Japan I really
feel the respect of many people

00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:57.016 align:middle line:90%
and there but in general even

00:21:57.016 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
in Japan we're not this
mother, we have forgotten.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.789 align:middle line:84%
>> You're right that's
because most of the people

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:05.158 align:middle line:90%
in Japan they worship nature,

00:22:05.158 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:84%
in Shintoism I'm telling you
they worship...they make...

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:10.863 align:middle line:84%
>> I love when you say I'm
telling you, I love it,

00:22:10.863 --> 00:22:13.566 align:middle line:84%
don't you love it, oh
my God it's precious.

00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:17.303 align:middle line:84%
>> This is really because
28 years I'm living here

00:22:17.303 --> 00:22:19.839 align:middle line:84%
and I experience Japanese
spirit, Japanese religion,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:23.476 align:middle line:84%
I studied them so in Shintoism
I study them very well you know,

00:22:23.476 --> 00:22:26.412 align:middle line:84%
really they love nature, they
pray to tree, they praying

00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:28.948 align:middle line:84%
to mountain, they're
praying to the sea,

00:22:28.948 --> 00:22:32.251 align:middle line:84%
they're really...I think that's
why they're really best country

00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:33.753 align:middle line:90%
because the mother earth

00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:36.923 align:middle line:84%
and mother natures
are protecting them

00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:39.092 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't mean that
they are not following

00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:43.196 align:middle line:84%
but really they believe
in nature and four times

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:48.367 align:middle line:84%
in a year...after every three
months you know the royal king

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:51.671 align:middle line:84%
family he comes and he
makes some ceremony,

00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:54.307 align:middle line:84%
it's the Shinto way to
bring blessing to the people

00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:58.845 align:middle line:84%
and blessing to the farming
people and fishing people,

00:22:58.845 --> 00:23:02.548 align:middle line:84%
this way I love this nation,
the Japanese are really near

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to the nation and
near to the God.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.987 align:middle line:84%
>> How about Japanese TV
tell us a little bit about it

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:11.057 align:middle line:84%
because you're doing some
shows, is it kind of strange

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:15.194 align:middle line:84%
where we turn on...how's
it doing?

00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:17.497 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually I'm living
more than 28 years here

00:23:17.497 --> 00:23:21.234 align:middle line:84%
so I can speak better than
English, my Japanese is better

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
than japanese as you can
understand yesterday,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.438 align:middle line:90%
I was talking in Japanese.

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:28.841 align:middle line:84%
So I learn I was graduated
from the Japanese university

00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:32.578 align:middle line:84%
so I was writer at the...in
the newspaper and people

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:36.082 align:middle line:84%
like my you know columns and
articles because in Pakistan

00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:84%
and coming to Japan and
writing some different angle.

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:41.254 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible section]
I wrote a book

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:44.157 align:middle line:84%
in Japanese then I
became famous in Japan

00:23:44.157 --> 00:23:46.492 align:middle line:84%
so after then the television
was asking me to come

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:49.662 align:middle line:84%
and do interview same
like you are doing.

00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:52.331 align:middle line:84%
So when I get this kind of
interview, no you should come

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:55.134 align:middle line:84%
over regular program
and just speak

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:57.069 align:middle line:90%
about ten minutes every week.

00:23:57.069 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving the message to
ten minutes then I get a lot

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.377 align:middle line:84%
of regular programs and now I
am giving any national issue

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:09.382 align:middle line:84%
like terrorism, Islam or what
problems come, they come to me,

00:24:09.382 --> 00:24:11.484 align:middle line:84%
they say give us you
opinion, what's happening.

00:24:11.484 --> 00:24:14.253 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you know problems
are happening in Japan also

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:18.457 align:middle line:84%
like religious terrorism, many
cult religion is also here

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:21.027 align:middle line:84%
so whenever something
happened they come to me,

00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:25.298 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I love to make
communication especially my main

00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:28.968 align:middle line:84%
talk is like this special talk,
I give them this special talk.

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.003 align:middle line:84%
>> How I have this
little question

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:34.240 align:middle line:84%
because you brought the word
cult, how do you define a cult,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.475 align:middle line:90%
how do people know it's a cult?

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:40.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually most of
the cult you know

00:24:40.012 --> 00:24:42.715 align:middle line:84%
in my definition
cult is you know

00:24:42.715 --> 00:24:45.117 align:middle line:84%
if the religion give you
spirit more [inaudible]

00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:47.687 align:middle line:84%
in your conscious level
is the best religion,

00:24:47.687 --> 00:24:49.922 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a new religion it
doesn't matter, what is trying

00:24:49.922 --> 00:24:51.824 align:middle line:84%
to do...because they
are innovating it,

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:54.727 align:middle line:84%
making the good...producing
the good people sending

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:57.630 align:middle line:84%
in the society and they're
producing a lot of things,

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.532 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
best religion.

00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:02.835 align:middle line:84%
The people who are creating the
people with the religious mind,

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
controlling their
mind and sending them

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.974 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the social
system, destroy the nation,

00:25:07.974 --> 00:25:10.877 align:middle line:84%
destroying the country
I think that's a cult,

00:25:10.877 --> 00:25:13.846 align:middle line:84%
even in Islam you can
say a lot of cults.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:16.883 align:middle line:84%
In our country, in our
nation so cult mean is

00:25:16.883 --> 00:25:19.952 align:middle line:84%
if the religion is
destroying the people,

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:22.188 align:middle line:84%
destroying the humanity
is the cult.

00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:26.058 align:middle line:84%
If the religion is building
the human nation or flourishing

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:29.061 align:middle line:84%
or maybe trying to produce
in the best people...

00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:30.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Without wanting to control.

00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:33.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Without wanting to control
so this is the way what I feel.

00:25:33.966 --> 00:25:37.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Beautiful...do you have

So we are the one family love

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:14.340 align:middle line:84%
religion, don't try to
make conflict and fight.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.311 align:middle line:84%
This is only way to bring
peace because only one love

00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:84%
of God can make peace
on the world

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:23.616 align:middle line:84%
and we can be a good family, a
loving family, we are the world,
