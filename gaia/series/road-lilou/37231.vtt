00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.114 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road in
California today with Sarina.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.319 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to be
speaking with you today.

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:19.386 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:20.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Sarina Stone: Very
happy to be here.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because you don't live
actually in California; do you?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: No.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.628 align:middle line:84%
I was actually on holiday
in Oregon working actually

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.964 align:middle line:84%
with an elderly friend
of mine learning

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:32.066 align:middle line:84%
about natural health
for seniors.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.569 align:middle line:84%
And heard you were going
to be here so I drove here

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.738 align:middle line:84%
but my home is in
Minnesota right now.

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:41.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you cover a lot of
topics and I'm really excited

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to have this conversation with
you because I know it's going

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.813 align:middle line:84%
to be profound and
make a difference

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:50.384 align:middle line:84%
and the Gaiam community is
really very much a community,

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:54.355 align:middle line:84%
you know, that is inspired,
that is knowledgeable

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.391 align:middle line:84%
so this is a perfect
crowd here to speak of.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.194 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
conversation about orgasm,

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:04.832 align:middle line:84%
sexual energy, sexual
healing, Tao.

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:10.171 align:middle line:84%
You have a special Tao
view on wellness; right?

00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
-- you found out how

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.677 align:middle line:84%
to yourself reduce
your aging process.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of -- we heard
a lot of that from [inaudible]

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's great to have this
beautiful female goddess

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.019 align:middle line:90%
and have this conversation.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:26.554 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:01:26.554 --> 00:01:28.989 align:middle line:84%
How do you actually
encapsulate your work?

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:31.859 align:middle line:90%
How would you summarize that?

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: You know, somebody

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.464 align:middle line:84%
over dinner last night
asked me how did you start

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:41.902 align:middle line:84%
with energy work and then get
into all this sexual stuff?

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.471 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm actually a
fairly conservative gal.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:49.242 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was my teacher
Taoist Master Mantak Chia,

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:54.181 align:middle line:84%
taught all of his students that
part of the basic knowledge

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:58.619 align:middle line:84%
of Tao and understanding the
energetics of the body is

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.622 align:middle line:84%
that you must have
control and be able

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:84%
to utilize your own
sexual energy.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:09.028 align:middle line:84%
It's so strong that if you
don't control it and use it,

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.899 align:middle line:90%
it will control and use you.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.134 align:middle line:84%
So that was just a
part of my training

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:17.104 align:middle line:84%
and I started training
about 20 years ago.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:20.374 align:middle line:84%
So for me it was a
very natural thing.

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:23.978 align:middle line:84%
Well, oh, of course I don't want
my sexual energy running my life

00:02:23.978 --> 00:02:27.147 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to get
menopause and have one

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:31.118 align:middle line:84%
of my biological alarm clocks
go off and so I start aging.

00:02:31.118 --> 00:02:33.954 align:middle line:84%
And so I was young and
it just seemed normal.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:38.425 align:middle line:84%
Well, now I'm two years away
from being 50 and I really feel

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.463 align:middle line:90%
like I stopped aging about 35.

00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:44.098 align:middle line:84%
I mean I won't say
I stopped aging.

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.901 align:middle line:84%
I'm still getting smarter, you
know, I have a couple little,

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:49.436 align:middle line:90%
ou know, wrinkles come in.

00:02:49.436 --> 00:02:53.841 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, my body
has retained its youthfulness

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.076 align:middle line:90%
since about 35.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:58.312 align:middle line:90%
So for me these -- working

00:02:58.312 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
with sexual energy including
orgasmic energy that's part

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.556 align:middle line:84%
of it; right, has been really
a natural piece of the puzzle.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:15.062 align:middle line:84%
As a teacher, I have to -- I
just have to acknowledge this.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:18.132 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can't talk
to women and not talk

00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:21.769 align:middle line:84%
about your sexuality
if you're going to talk

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.304 align:middle line:90%
about physical health.

00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:24.672 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:28.909 align:middle line:84%
Our hormones shift every 28
days, actually every 14 days.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.577 align:middle line:84%
You're going to ovulate and
then you're going to menstruate;

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.346 align:middle line:84%
you're going to ovulate, then
you're going to menstruate,

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.282 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to go into
menopause for like five years.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:38.018 align:middle line:84%
You know I have to
talk about this stuff.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a conservative girl

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.389 align:middle line:84%
but there I am talking
about orgasms.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.724 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And also it's very important
these days for all the moms

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
out there and dads that
have kids and are really,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.633 align:middle line:84%
really scared about what's
going on with the social media

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.302 align:middle line:84%
and how -- what they
think of sexuality

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.204 align:middle line:84%
and just giving a
little blow job is just

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:59.707 align:middle line:84%
like a shake of hand
or something?

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:02.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: In this
country I was shocked.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing about this
about three or four years ago

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:11.251 align:middle line:84%
that kids in our high schools
were viewing oral sex not as sex

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.253 align:middle line:90%
but more like a handshake.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And a handshake you can use to
get somebody to do your homework

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.792 align:middle line:84%
for you or get invited
to a party.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.127 align:middle line:84%
I mean I almost fell
off my chair.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:25.532 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think my
country's probably not the only

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:32.373 align:middle line:84%
country with really flagrant
sexuality in our music videos

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:35.275 align:middle line:90%
and in our films but it's had

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:84%
such a profound effect
on the kids.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:41.482 align:middle line:84%
And in my country, America,
it's very normal for the mother

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:84%
and the father to have to go
out all day and go to work.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.855 align:middle line:84%
It takes two incomes now to
keep a household running.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.923 align:middle line:84%
So the kids are at home
and they're watching --

00:04:49.923 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I won't say what stations, but
they're watching music videos

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.395 align:middle line:90%
and they're watching movies.

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:56.764 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the parents
don't have good control

00:04:56.764 --> 00:05:00.567 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you know
we've got 14-year-olds doing

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
things that they
shouldn't be doing.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:84%
So these kinds of
teachings must start at home.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.443 align:middle line:84%
They absolutely have
to, you know,

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.579 align:middle line:84%
start with the parents
talking about these things.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.716 align:middle line:84%
I've met lots of children
all over this country

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
that have a very healthy
attitude about their body

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.091 align:middle line:84%
and their heart and sexuality
because mom and dad sat them

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:28.228 align:middle line:84%
down repeatedly and told
them how it really is.

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:28.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.297 align:middle line:90%
So how is it really?

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.467 align:middle line:84%
Because I think for adults or
younger ones watching, everybody

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
or moms or in the
50s or whatever,

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.672 align:middle line:90%
what is really sex about?

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:41.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, I think
it depends on who you are.

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:44.445 align:middle line:84%
If you're -- I suppose
if you're an 18, 19,

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:47.714 align:middle line:84%
20-year-old it may just
be about exploration.

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.283 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't advocate a 14-year-old
being sexually active.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.188 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:05:54.188 --> 00:05:55.622 align:middle line:90%
I just don't; okay?

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:56.757 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:05:56.757 --> 00:06:00.027 align:middle line:84%
I'll take that but so
for a young person --

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:03.163 align:middle line:90%
when I say young, 18 or older --

00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:84%
sure maybe sometimes sex
is just about exploration.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.637 align:middle line:84%
But after a couple of
years I think what some

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:15.108 align:middle line:84%
of us have forgotten that sex
used to be a way to communicate

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.177 align:middle line:90%
with another human being.

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.379 align:middle line:84%
It could be communicating
I love you;

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.783 align:middle line:84%
it could be communicating
I think you're really hot;

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:25.052 align:middle line:84%
it could be communicating
a lot of things.

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:27.855 align:middle line:84%
But it was, you know,
taught to a lot of us

00:06:27.855 --> 00:06:29.957 align:middle line:90%
as a form of communication.

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:33.894 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, if you get
into the Tao, it's also a form

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:37.397 align:middle line:90%
of connection and exchange.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:42.669 align:middle line:84%
We -- in my association,
Universal Healing Tao,

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.605 align:middle line:90%
we call that the practice

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:48.775 align:middle line:84%
of exchanging sexual
energy healing love.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:52.379 align:middle line:84%
Because we've learned
how to use this energy

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.582 align:middle line:90%
for health and healing.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: When does it
get into the healing part?

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:84%
When -- is that a mindset;
is that an intention;

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.391 align:middle line:90%
is that two conscious partners?

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
be there and to have

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.763 align:middle line:84%
that even though the
partner is not so much

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.666 align:middle line:84%
into the spirituality
portion of things?

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:16.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean tell us this process
of when does it get healing?

00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:20.173 align:middle line:84%
I mean when does it start
to be a healing modality?

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: I don't know that
a person needs training.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:26.613 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I know a
person does not need training

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:31.285 align:middle line:84%
to connect with another
human being in a loving way.

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:35.022 align:middle line:84%
Now if it becomes a
spiritual experience; okay.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Okay. That's not my area

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.359 align:middle line:84%
but I've certainly had
a personal experience

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.828 align:middle line:84%
where I've been with
somebody and it just seems

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
to have gone way beyond
the physical; okay?

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:84%
It feels spiritual to me and it
felt spiritual to my partner.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.503 align:middle line:90%
But, you know, let's --

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's about
getting there, yeah?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, without
having a conversation

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
about the spirituality,
it just felt connected

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:04.318 align:middle line:84%
and after the experience we
felt nourished, not weakened.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.019 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is -- you asked

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:08.288 align:middle line:84%
where does it start becoming
a healing experience?

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:12.759 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can throw all your
energy away and be depleted

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:16.964 align:middle line:84%
and maybe get sick if you
get depleted too often,

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:22.302 align:middle line:84%
or you can gain energy from
being with another person.

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:26.273 align:middle line:84%
Now, again in my association
and what I teach and the videos

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.009 align:middle line:84%
and audio that, you know,
that I provide, yeah,

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
we're actually going to give you
some very methodical formulas

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle line:84%
of things you can do first by
yourself and then try to share

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.519 align:middle line:84%
with another person so
you are having conscious

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.787 align:middle line:90%
sexual experiences.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:45.659 align:middle line:84%
You can still wear costumes and
hang from the chandelier but,

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:48.295 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's a level
of consciousness here.

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:50.764 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes it healing

00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
or you could be conscious
and be hurtful.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.702 align:middle line:90%
I think more than one person

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:57.838 align:middle line:84%
in your audience has
probably had anger sex.

00:08:57.838 --> 00:09:02.209 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean it happens and
do you feel good afterwards?

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.977 align:middle line:90%
Maybe for a minute.

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.513 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for a minute and then
afterwards you usually want

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:08.281 align:middle line:90%
to get away from that person

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.885 align:middle line:84%
if we are having an
exchange out of anger; right?

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:12.586 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:13.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Obligation.

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:17.357 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how much sex is going
on here in this planet just

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:20.661 align:middle line:90%
from pure manipulation or --

00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:22.796 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, you used
the word obligation.

00:09:22.796 --> 00:09:26.366 align:middle line:84%
You know for me I'm also a
writer and I've written books

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.835 align:middle line:90%
on conscious relationships.

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:31.672 align:middle line:90%
It is shocking to me how many --

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:35.876 align:middle line:84%
mostly women for the
obvious reason, we can --

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:38.645 align:middle line:90%
have sex out of obligation.

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:43.116 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is my husband and,
you know, I don't want him to be

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:45.886 align:middle line:84%
with someone else so
I have to do this.

00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:47.354 align:middle line:90%
And it's just depleting.

00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:50.157 align:middle line:84%
It just takes the energy
right out of everybody.

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:52.893 align:middle line:84%
You think that he can't tell
you don't want to be there.

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.262 align:middle line:84%
Of course he can tell you
don't want to be there.

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:59.232 align:middle line:84%
But we do it anyways out
of a sense of obligation.

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:02.602 align:middle line:84%
To me that sounds like torture
and I would need therapy.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.072 align:middle line:90%
I mean -- and they do.

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:10.243 align:middle line:84%
So there's -- the one
way to have a healing

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:12.646 align:middle line:84%
and healthy experience
is to actually care

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.114 align:middle line:90%
for the person that you're with.

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:17.584 align:middle line:90%
Slow down and exchange energy.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:22.556 align:middle line:84%
You don't need Sarina or
Master Mantak Chia or you

00:10:22.556 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:84%
to tell them how
to love somebody

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.794 align:middle line:84%
and just slow down
and be present.

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:32.499 align:middle line:84%
So many people in the Tao system
they are studying many years

00:10:32.499 --> 00:10:35.102 align:middle line:84%
just to learn what
a young couple

00:10:35.102 --> 00:10:37.838 align:middle line:90%
in love does naturally; okay?

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we have to
be brought back to that space.

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:43.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But I think
the big issue is a lot

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:46.847 align:middle line:84%
of the sexual practices are not
done from that place of love.

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:50.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: This is a problem
that I see out there.

00:10:50.183 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to mention other
disciplines that I've seen.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:55.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Tantra.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Yeah.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.091 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that go awry.

00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Okay. I've seen it, yes.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.827 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Think about
it because it's.

00:11:02.295 --> 00:11:07.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, look the Tantra
that I've seen is very similar

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:13.039 align:middle line:84%
to the Tao system that I teach
in that it's a long process

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.243 align:middle line:84%
of learning about the
self and self examination

00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:21.948 align:middle line:84%
and then we learn about our
sexual energy and then we share.

00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:27.087 align:middle line:84%
But what I've seen in a few
countries is they've taken this

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.156 align:middle line:84%
and they only took
the sex part, you see,

00:11:29.156 --> 00:11:31.525 align:middle line:84%
and then they put a
bunch of people in a room

00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.661 align:middle line:84%
and they only talk about the
sex part and so all these people

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that have not cultivated
themselves

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.701 align:middle line:84%
as loving self aware human
beings are now having sex

00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.805 align:middle line:84%
with each other and they can't
understand why they're fighting

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:84%
and these relationships
aren't working out.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:50.177 align:middle line:84%
And they get Kundalini Syndrome,
they've brought too much energy

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.411 align:middle line:84%
up to their head
and they go kind

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:55.015 align:middle line:84%
of a little strange,
you know, so yeah.

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:57.284 align:middle line:90%
You know, but I should say this.

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:58.518 align:middle line:90%
I should say this.

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:02.956 align:middle line:84%
I've also met Tantra
people who really,

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:06.493 align:middle line:84%
I mean have dedicated their
life to this Indian; right,

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.595 align:middle line:84%
east Indian lifestyle
and they're some

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.497 align:middle line:84%
of the more beautiful
people I've met.

00:12:10.497 --> 00:12:11.998 align:middle line:90%
And I think if I was going

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:14.634 align:middle line:84%
to be really honest I
would say I've seen people

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:18.405 align:middle line:84%
in the Tao system even
I don't want to smile

00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%
to my liver before I do my sex.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.074 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.342 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to smile at all.

00:12:22.342 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:90%
This is stupid.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.613 align:middle line:84%
I just want to learn how to
have an erection all night long;

00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:30.217 align:middle line:84%
right, and have as many
orgasms as I want or whatever.

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So they miss the important
part of cultivating the self

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.188 align:middle line:90%
and opening the heart.

00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:38.959 align:middle line:84%
And then they have this
partial experience.

00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.627 align:middle line:84%
And that really is --
that's what happened.

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:43.096 align:middle line:90%
It's just a partial experience.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:46.867 align:middle line:84%
The true Tao, the
true Tantra really is

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:48.802 align:middle line:90%
about connecting heart to heart.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:53.273 align:middle line:84%
And it is not that easy unless
you're an innocent child

00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.175 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have
sex; remember, right?

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't advocate that.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.749 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Bringing ourselves back
to a place of trust and openness

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.818 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
you can really connect

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:06.319 align:middle line:90%
with another human being.

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:07.954 align:middle line:90%
It might take training

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.291 align:middle line:84%
for a year before
you're actually ready

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.828 align:middle line:84%
and by you I don't mean you,
I mean in general; right?

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:17.163 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can say we.

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:19.966 align:middle line:84%
We may need a year or
two of just working

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:24.671 align:middle line:84%
on ourself before we're
really ready to trust

00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and open ourselves to
another human being.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.809 align:middle line:90%
To me this is the key.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:34.781 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to
healthy sexuality and I

00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:41.955 align:middle line:84%
like the Tao system that I
teach because I don't have

00:13:41.955 --> 00:13:44.724 align:middle line:84%
to figure my way
around here blindly.

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:47.894 align:middle line:84%
There are very specific
practices

00:13:47.894 --> 00:13:52.132 align:middle line:84%
to balance the emotions
for example;

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:58.071 align:middle line:84%
to balance the hormones; to
bring self awareness, you know,

00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:01.007 align:middle line:90%
back into our daily routines.

00:14:01.007 --> 00:14:02.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And lot of people

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.679 align:middle line:84%
or some people especially the
French people feel this sexual

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.582 align:middle line:84%
energy, you know, how do
you feel with this thing?

00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with this
thing ongoingly, you know.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.753 align:middle line:84%
Day-to-day some people get
towards the addiction of it.

00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:17.457 align:middle line:84%
But how do you do it so that
it doesn't drive your life

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:19.326 align:middle line:84%
and you actually
are in control of it

00:14:19.326 --> 00:14:22.262 align:middle line:84%
or actually use it
more usefully?

00:14:22.262 --> 00:14:25.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, one of the
wonderful things that happens

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:31.371 align:middle line:84%
when you follow these Tao
protocols that I teach is

00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:35.742 align:middle line:84%
that I just -- part of
what happens is we learn

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:38.411 align:middle line:90%
to harness our sexual energy.

00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:42.849 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you've harnessed
your sexual energy,

00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:45.085 align:middle line:90%
then it's not controlling you.

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're going to
make sexual energy every day.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:52.125 align:middle line:84%
And then we learn how to use
it to make our organs stronger

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:58.999 align:middle line:84%
to make our skin better; to heal
ourselves if we get sick; okay?

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:04.037 align:middle line:84%
Now if you can train this
for 6 months, 12 months,

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:05.638 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden what
happens is, you know,

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:09.476 align:middle line:84%
you're making sexual energy and
it just automatically transforms

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.311 align:middle line:90%
up and goes where you need it.

00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:12.612 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:15:12.612 --> 00:15:15.382 align:middle line:84%
I mean you kind of have to
do it to have the experience

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:19.019 align:middle line:84%
but that was my experience
and I don't know.

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean hundreds and hundreds
of people I've worked with,

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:25.959 align:middle line:84%
you know, in classroom format
or one-on-one and then thousands

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.361 align:middle line:84%
if you consider all of the
people that watch the videos

00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:31.598 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling you everybody
has the same experience.

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:35.335 align:middle line:84%
It gets a little rough for
a while as you're cleaning

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:38.304 align:middle line:84%
out your negative
belief systems; okay?

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:40.707 align:middle line:84%
Gets a little rough and that's
why we have our practices,

00:15:40.707 --> 00:15:45.745 align:middle line:84%
to smile, relax, balance the
emotions, just go with the flow

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:46.746 align:middle line:90%
for a while you'll be okay.

00:15:46.746 --> 00:15:48.748 align:middle line:84%
And then there just
comes a point

00:15:48.748 --> 00:15:55.522 align:middle line:84%
where you realize I've been
kind of balanced for months now.

00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:58.625 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time to add
something to this and I'm going

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.493 align:middle line:84%
to start working on
my sexual energy.

00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:02.095 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you're going to
have more crap come up.

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:04.364 align:middle line:90%
Oh, can I say that?

00:16:04.364 --> 00:16:06.766 align:middle line:84%
Okay. There you're going to
have more bad things come

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:84%
up if you have negative
beliefs about intimacy

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:13.006 align:middle line:84%
which about 90 percent of
the people I run into --

00:16:13.006 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Some of the beliefs?

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Do you want to talk
about France for a minute?

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:20.947 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I have
French merchandise; okay?

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:21.948 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:23.349 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's what
I find in France.

00:16:23.349 --> 00:16:26.252 align:middle line:84%
First of all, some of the most
wonderful people I've ever met

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:27.887 align:middle line:90%
are the French.

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I teach in Bordeaux and I teach
in Paris but I've traveled

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
around your absolutely
beautiful country.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.732 align:middle line:84%
And wow. I mean what hardworking
ethical wonderful folks

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:42.268 align:middle line:84%
especially as they get a
little older, you know.

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:45.505 align:middle line:84%
But I run into this
problem everywhere.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:49.776 align:middle line:84%
It feels like the men
are focused very much

00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:55.315 align:middle line:84%
on creating a wonderful home
by making money and they're

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:59.919 align:middle line:84%
out a lot and they're really
focused on their career.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:02.889 align:middle line:84%
And the women are
very, very focused

00:17:02.889 --> 00:17:07.494 align:middle line:84%
on making a beautiful home,
raising kids, self, you know,

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:09.928 align:middle line:84%
working on the self so that
the house is a better place

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:13.233 align:middle line:84%
and there's a huge
disconnect there; okay?

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Huge disconnection.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.404 align:middle line:84%
This is what I see a
lot when I'm in France.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:19.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Pretty worldwide too.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:21.573 align:middle line:84%
I mean this sounds like
America right now too.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:22.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Yeah.

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, somebody
said something to me

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.945 align:middle line:90%
about France the other day.

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:28.481 align:middle line:84%
She said she works
with children.

00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:31.718 align:middle line:84%
And she said you know what
your average French parents do

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:35.155 align:middle line:84%
when their child does
something really good in school?

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:36.556 align:middle line:90%
After they say good job,

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:39.359 align:middle line:84%
they say you know what you could
have done to have made better?

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.394 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is exclusively
French.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:90%
You have to know that.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:43.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's a big practice.

00:17:43.296 --> 00:17:45.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: It's a big
practice in France.

00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:46.733 align:middle line:90%
Well, what happens is we grow

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:50.003 align:middle line:84%
up then never being
good enough; okay?

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:53.706 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, he's going to
stay at work to be better and,

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.441 align:middle line:84%
of course, she's going
to work extra hard

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.043 align:middle line:90%
on the house to be better.

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:58.978 align:middle line:84%
So where do I come
into the picture?

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:01.981 align:middle line:84%
And it does work when I can
just get them both to stop

00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:84%
for a minute, is we
just talk about it.

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:10.456 align:middle line:84%
I go look, ma'am or -- look at
he's working so hard for you

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:13.693 align:middle line:84%
and then we say to the
fellow, now she doesn't care.

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.495 align:middle line:90%
You have to understand that.

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't care if
you make more money.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.498 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't care.

00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:90%
She just wants to be with you

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.534 align:middle line:84%
and then we still
open this dialogue.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:26.206 align:middle line:84%
They don't need Tao training to
have that dialogue and just talk

00:18:26.206 --> 00:18:28.741 align:middle line:90%
to each other for ten minutes.

00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:30.176 align:middle line:84%
Half the time they end
up leaving, they go home

00:18:30.176 --> 00:18:32.879 align:middle line:84%
and they have sex and
it's great, you know.

00:18:32.879 --> 00:18:37.183 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, yes, what I
teach I think it works.

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:38.952 align:middle line:84%
If I can get them
to stop long enough

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and take a class and they do.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.888 align:middle line:90%
I love teaching in Paris.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:43.189 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:45.692 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
just going to dinner

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:47.627 align:middle line:90%
and having an open conversation

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle line:84%
that may be they haven't
had before and he needs

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:54.868 align:middle line:84%
to hear her say, I'm working
really hard because I want you

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:59.205 align:middle line:84%
to come home to a beautiful
wife and a beautiful home

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:01.774 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to rip
my clothes off; okay.

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
You know. I want
you to be delighted.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.247 align:middle line:84%
And then he gets to
say his part as well.

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:08.681 align:middle line:90%
And then something happens.

00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:10.416 align:middle line:84%
First they yell at each
other for a few minutes

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:11.985 align:middle line:90%
and then something happens.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:16.556 align:middle line:84%
And this opening of the heart
happens and that's really --

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:19.125 align:middle line:84%
it's really what all these
practices are about is,

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:21.928 align:middle line:84%
you know, connecting
and remembering

00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:84%
that there's a reason you
fell in love with each other.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There is
and women have a lot

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.836 align:middle line:84%
of masculine energy
these days too

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.404 align:middle line:90%
and there's this dis-imbalance

00:19:31.404 --> 00:19:34.073 align:middle line:84%
and men too have
this dis-imbalance

00:19:34.073 --> 00:19:37.844 align:middle line:84%
in the feminine too so isn't
that part of the problem too is

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.079 align:middle line:84%
that women are trying
to be men and then it's

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:42.749 align:middle line:84%
like making this big
mess where, you know?

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:46.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Did you read one of my
books or did you just know that?

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:48.621 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. It is a problem
as I see it.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:52.258 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, maybe we
have the same opinion.

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:56.863 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing and I'm going to
do this talk about countries

00:19:56.863 --> 00:19:58.264 align:middle line:90%
because I -- it's different.

00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:01.634 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a country that
was war torn, for example,

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:03.670 align:middle line:90%
maybe in the last 80 years.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.873 align:middle line:84%
Well, the men left and
they went to war; okay.

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The women stayed home and
they took care of everything.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.549 align:middle line:84%
They became masculine or in the
Tao, in Chinese we say Yang.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.784 align:middle line:90%
They're Yang.

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:20.787 align:middle line:84%
Well, then their mother
raised them to be like this.

00:20:20.787 --> 00:20:22.689 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can't count
on the guys.

00:20:22.689 --> 00:20:25.591 align:middle line:84%
Because they've come
back very injured; okay.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.759 align:middle line:90%
They're very Yin.

00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:29.195 align:middle line:84%
Right now they need
to be taken care of.

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:32.699 align:middle line:84%
So you've got three generations
later the men are complaining a

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:36.002 align:middle line:84%
lot and they're very --
have a lot of Yin energy

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:39.906 align:middle line:84%
and the woman are very Yang and
they're taking care of the men

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's resentful
now because men do not want

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:90%
to be treated like a girl.

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:46.913 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:50.783 align:middle line:84%
And so the women say,
fine, stop acting like one.

00:20:50.783 --> 00:20:54.287 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile the truth is
that women are in their place

00:20:54.287 --> 00:20:57.123 align:middle line:84%
of power when they're
Yin really.

00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:59.258 align:middle line:90%
When we're soft and smile.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:20:59.993 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:90%
You're a business women.

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:02.228 align:middle line:90%
You go to a meeting.

00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:04.497 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a meeting with
a big smile on your face

00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're very sweet
and you just listen

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.069 align:middle line:84%
and speak intelligently but
show respect and you're Yin

00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:14.006 align:middle line:84%
and you're soft, it's kind of
hard to say no to you; okay.

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:17.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I just had
that example right now

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:19.045 align:middle line:90%
because we had the little --

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:20.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Yeah.

00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:22.482 align:middle line:84%
You just went and were very
sweet and wonderful and gorgeous

00:21:22.482 --> 00:21:24.751 align:middle line:84%
and you were very
hard to say no to.

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:26.452 align:middle line:84%
So the men that were
making all the noise,

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.088 align:middle line:84%
buy this beautiful
tree, went away.

00:21:29.088 --> 00:21:31.424 align:middle line:84%
Now if you had gone over
there and yelled at them

00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:34.594 align:middle line:84%
and become very Yang, you
know, and tried to push

00:21:34.594 --> 00:21:38.731 align:middle line:84%
and make it happen, I feel
very sure you would have had a

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:39.932 align:middle line:90%
different experience.

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they would have left
but not very pleasantly.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So we are having this
interesting role reversal.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.508 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll talk about
my country again.

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:49.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:53.312 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people in
Gaiam are actually from the U.S.

00:21:53.312 --> 00:21:55.782 align:middle line:84%
so that's a very good
country to look at.

00:21:55.782 --> 00:21:57.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Some of
our folks that are

00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:01.754 align:middle line:84%
into natural health are
not having this problem

00:22:01.754 --> 00:22:04.157 align:middle line:84%
where the women are
very angry at the men

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:06.592 align:middle line:84%
and they're raising
angry daughters.

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:10.096 align:middle line:84%
I find educated people that
are in a natural health,

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:13.533 align:middle line:84%
they tend -- they self
explore and they deal

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:16.536 align:middle line:84%
with the anger before they
raise their daughter; okay?

00:22:16.536 --> 00:22:18.771 align:middle line:90%
But then there's the rest of us.

00:22:18.771 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's a big country.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.474 align:middle line:90%
Lots of different states

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:24.444 align:middle line:84%
and each state has
their own tradition.

00:22:24.444 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm -- it makes me -- it
breaks my heart sometimes to go

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.685 align:middle line:84%
and meet these mothers
and daughters

00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:35.688 align:middle line:84%
and the mothers are teaching
their daughters men are bad.

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:39.292 align:middle line:84%
They lie; they will betray
you; you have to be tough;

00:22:39.292 --> 00:22:41.661 align:middle line:90%
you can't trust anybody.

00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:43.596 align:middle line:84%
You go get what you
want, sweetheart.

00:22:43.596 --> 00:22:45.331 align:middle line:90%
You get it on your own.

00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:46.165 align:middle line:90%
That's --

00:22:46.165 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That's pretty much --

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.469 align:middle line:84%
most women I would say
have that in mind, yeah.

00:22:49.469 --> 00:22:51.604 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: It's tough.

00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:84%
Now you meet them
at 30 are you happy?

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:58.177 align:middle line:90%
Hell -- heck no.

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:00.112 align:middle line:84%
No. They're not happy;
they're miserable.

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:03.382 align:middle line:84%
They don't trust anybody and
then they grow up to be people

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:90%
that can't be trusted.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.186 align:middle line:84%
I mean we become
what we believe.

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:09.622 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, these
are the issues

00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:12.158 align:middle line:84%
and so you have some women
out there and men that are --

00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:15.795 align:middle line:84%
we're just trying to teach a
different kind of sexuality.

00:23:15.795 --> 00:23:18.598 align:middle line:90%
A different kind of humanity.

00:23:18.598 --> 00:23:21.067 align:middle line:90%
Can we bring the humanity back?

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:24.637 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not a Bible
reading kind of person

00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:27.106 align:middle line:84%
but I respect some of
these things I've heard.

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:29.742 align:middle line:84%
And somebody once said to
me, well, the original word

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:90%
of Christ was

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.379 align:middle line:84%
about unconditional
love and acceptance.

00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, heck, I could
get behind that, you know.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:39.719 align:middle line:84%
I've met Buddhists and they
say the same thing and Tao --

00:23:39.719 --> 00:23:41.420 align:middle line:84%
well, Taoism isn't
really a religion

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.891 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a Jew and
we believe that.

00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:48.027 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some
pretty basic principles here

00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:53.499 align:middle line:84%
but somehow being in
survival we have forgotten

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:56.836 align:middle line:84%
and we've become
very aggressive.

00:23:56.836 --> 00:23:59.338 align:middle line:84%
And the men it's
too much for them.

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:02.742 align:middle line:84%
We put too much on
their shoulders

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:05.811 align:middle line:84%
and they've collapsed
a little bit, you know.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.446 align:middle line:84%
And so they have a lot
of breakdowns and they're

00:24:07.446 --> 00:24:10.316 align:middle line:84%
on Prozac and, you know,
and things like that.

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:12.919 align:middle line:84%
Do I think we can come
back as a culture,

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:16.589 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and
connect again?

00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:19.725 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I see nothing wrong
with being feminine.

00:24:19.725 --> 00:24:22.628 align:middle line:84%
Even if that means he stays
home and I go to work.

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:26.032 align:middle line:84%
I still see nothing wrong with
me being a women about it.

00:24:26.032 --> 00:24:31.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how does that
translate in bed in the actually

00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:32.672 align:middle line:90%
in the act of lovemaking?

00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:35.708 align:middle line:84%
How does a women -- what
is your advice for women

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:38.811 align:middle line:84%
to be their beautiful
delicious self?

00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: All right.

00:24:40.446 --> 00:24:42.281 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you a short story.

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:45.651 align:middle line:84%
I went for, I don't
know, about a year

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:49.088 align:middle line:84%
where no man really
wanted to date me.

00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:51.757 align:middle line:90%
Okay. I know; I'm telling you.

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:57.463 align:middle line:84%
It was -- so I was with this
shaman visiting in Thailand

00:24:57.463 --> 00:25:00.066 align:middle line:84%
and one night because they
bring out the emotion in you

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:01.968 align:middle line:84%
and I just broke down
and started crying.

00:25:01.968 --> 00:25:04.036 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing

00:25:04.036 --> 00:25:06.739 align:middle line:84%
and he said you don't know why
men don't want to date you?

00:25:06.739 --> 00:25:09.242 align:middle line:90%
I said no, I don't understand.

00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:84%
He said Sarina, you teach sex
and sexuality and you talk

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.448 align:middle line:90%
about it all the time.

00:25:15.448 --> 00:25:18.351 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
that does for a guy?

00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:19.752 align:middle line:90%
We want to be the man.

00:25:19.752 --> 00:25:23.022 align:middle line:84%
You see. When we go to bed we
would at least like the illusion

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:26.592 align:middle line:84%
that we are taking you
an a magical journey.

00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:28.294 align:middle line:90%
We want to give you pleasure.

00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:32.098 align:middle line:84%
We want to watch you and
feel you and hear you.

00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:35.635 align:middle line:84%
This is how men have been
throughout history and you go

00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:37.803 align:middle line:90%
in there and tell us what to do?

00:25:37.803 --> 00:25:40.172 align:middle line:84%
Some guys are going to
find it very interesting

00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:42.208 align:middle line:90%
but most of us aren't.

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:43.409 align:middle line:90%
And I got to tell you

00:25:43.409 --> 00:25:48.314 align:middle line:84%
that profoundly changed
the way I spoke to men

00:25:48.314 --> 00:25:50.349 align:middle line:90%
and about men after that.

00:25:50.349 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:84%
I understood that,
yeah, there's some stuff

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:56.722 align:middle line:84%
in us that's just
instinctual and, you know what?

00:25:56.722 --> 00:26:01.927 align:middle line:84%
It's really nice to be in
bed with a man and, you know,

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:07.166 align:middle line:84%
let him try to please
me and just slow down,

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:09.835 align:middle line:90%
you know, tell him what I like.

00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:12.605 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that
to all you girls; okay.

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%
If you can't communicate
with somebody well enough

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.777 align:middle line:84%
to tell him, oh,
that feels good.

00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:18.544 align:middle line:90%
That feels good.

00:26:18.544 --> 00:26:20.246 align:middle line:90%
That is three words; okay?

00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.481 align:middle line:84%
If you can't communicate
with that person enough just

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:26.819 align:middle line:84%
to say that, then
you need to stop

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:30.256 align:middle line:90%
and talk first, connect first.

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:33.793 align:middle line:84%
And for gentlemen, you
know, I would tell you.

00:26:33.793 --> 00:26:37.463 align:middle line:84%
This thing where you're
thinking about baseball trying

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to sustain your erection,
it doesn't work for us.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.201 align:middle line:90%
We don't like that.

00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We can tell that
you're not there; okay.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.407 align:middle line:84%
We would rather just slow
down and do something else

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:51.844 align:middle line:84%
until you get control
and then start again.

00:26:51.844 --> 00:26:56.115 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the Tao
practices come in, is we teach,

00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:59.118 align:middle line:84%
you know, individuals and
then they can, you know,

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:03.823 align:middle line:84%
try together how to
sustain their energy.

00:27:03.823 --> 00:27:06.158 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sustain
an erection.

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:08.794 align:middle line:84%
And a man can have as
many orgasms as he wants

00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:13.265 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to slow down,
and connect with your partner.

00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:15.067 align:middle line:90%
Connect with your self.

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:18.971 align:middle line:84%
You know, how about maybe a
little communication here.

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.607 align:middle line:90%
Talk to each other.

00:27:21.607 --> 00:27:25.811 align:middle line:84%
I know some outrageous
people you say to them, Okay.

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:28.114 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have a big
personality; do you talk in bed?

00:27:28.114 --> 00:27:28.914 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely not.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:30.516 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not, no.

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:32.184 align:middle line:90%
No. Well --

00:27:32.184 --> 00:27:33.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How about
that the importance

00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:37.957 align:middle line:90%
of that to obtain orgasm?

00:27:37.957 --> 00:27:41.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: Well, I'm thinking
if you can't relax enough

00:27:41.494 --> 00:27:43.562 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
your partner,

00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:47.032 align:middle line:84%
it would be very difficult to
relax enough to allow an orgasm

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:90%
to happen especially for women.

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:52.738 align:middle line:84%
We have a -- our
plumbing is inside; okay?

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:54.039 align:middle line:90%
No, really.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.143 align:middle line:84%
You know, with the exception
of the tip of the clitoris

00:27:57.143 --> 00:28:00.079 align:middle line:84%
which can be overstimulated
in about a second; okay?

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:02.748 align:middle line:84%
And then nothing's going
to happen; all right?

00:28:02.748 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
You know, especially women,
it's mostly in the mind.

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:10.022 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:15.194 align:middle line:84%
A young man he could just
look at a beautiful woman and,

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:20.099 align:middle line:84%
you know, barely touch himself
at all and ejaculate; okay.

00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:90%
So it's up here.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.202 align:middle line:90%
It's up here.

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:28.474 align:middle line:84%
So if we just take a little
time and train ourselves

00:28:28.474 --> 00:28:32.378 align:middle line:84%
to view sexuality and sex
itself in a different way, well,

00:28:32.378 --> 00:28:37.416 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find that what an
orgasm is changes, by the way.

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:39.852 align:middle line:84%
You can have a big orgasm;
you can have a little orgasm.

00:28:39.852 --> 00:28:41.954 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do with that energy?

00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to let it out
and give it to your partner?

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.357 align:middle line:90%
Could you reverse the flow?

00:28:45.357 --> 00:28:48.027 align:middle line:84%
Keep it in your own
body, you know,

00:28:48.027 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't know circulate
that energy in another way.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.499 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a lot of stuff
to do with orgasmic energy

00:28:53.499 --> 00:28:56.202 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
ways to raise the energy.

00:28:56.202 --> 00:28:58.204 align:middle line:84%
For a man especially
you don't have

00:28:58.204 --> 00:29:01.173 align:middle line:84%
to take it all the
way to ejaculation.

00:29:01.173 --> 00:29:03.609 align:middle line:84%
So you know but in
order to get --

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:05.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But it doesn't
mean orgasm either,

00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:06.912 align:middle line:90%
ejaculation, does it?

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:08.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Well, for a man,

00:29:08.447 --> 00:29:11.817 align:middle line:84%
orgasm and ejaculation are
two separate bodily functions.

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:16.388 align:middle line:84%
Period. And I don't know about
you guys, but I was shocked.

00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:18.691 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea but
it is a truism.

00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:23.095 align:middle line:84%
And so in some of these
disciplines especially what I

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:24.496 align:middle line:90%
teach, yeah.

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:31.237 align:middle line:84%
Yes. We learn to bring for a man
to bring that feeling of orgasm

00:29:31.237 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:84%
up pretty high and then sort of
lock down the ejaculation part

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.646 align:middle line:90%
and allow the orgasm to happen.

00:29:40.646 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that is very
different about what I teach

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:48.454 align:middle line:84%
and what I practice is that
I choose most of the time not

00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:90%
to let that orgasmic energy out.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:52.591 align:middle line:84%
First, you've got to
get to your place --

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:55.461 align:middle line:84%
to a place you can
even have one.

00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But once you get there and
everyone does after a while.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.032 align:middle line:90%
I mean you learn about yourself.

00:30:00.032 --> 00:30:01.367 align:middle line:90%
You learn what you like.

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:04.203 align:middle line:84%
You learn who you should and
should not be sharing with.

00:30:04.203 --> 00:30:05.304 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:30:05.304 --> 00:30:07.339 align:middle line:84%
But then you get to
this point where raising

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:11.644 align:middle line:84%
that energy becomes quite
easy; okay, for men and women.

00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:14.747 align:middle line:84%
Then the question is what
do I want to do with it?

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:19.618 align:middle line:84%
And in the Tao we believe
that adding that energy

00:30:19.618 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to your life force will
enhance your vibration.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:84%
My experience is that it
basically stopped the clock.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:30.429 align:middle line:84%
I mean I can't believe
what it's doing

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:32.564 align:middle line:84%
to my cellular regeneration
here.

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:38.003 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into a big chat
about what science has shown

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:43.575 align:middle line:84%
that the vibration of an orgasm
does to cellular, to our cells.

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Cellular communication,
cellular division; okay?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.149 align:middle line:90%
But the research is out there.

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:52.384 align:middle line:84%
I invite everybody to
go look at it; okay.

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Study Master Mantak Chia's work.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.188 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty incredible.

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:59.892 align:middle line:84%
What we now know is
in orgasmic energy.

00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:01.427 align:middle line:90%
I mean you can actually feel it.

00:31:01.427 --> 00:31:02.628 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty dam powerful; right?

00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:05.931 align:middle line:90%
When you add that to the body

00:31:05.931 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and mindful, you
put it somewhere.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.104 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I broke a bone or oh, my
liver is giving me trouble or,

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:15.474 align:middle line:84%
you know, my hair is
not so thick or lovely.

00:31:15.474 --> 00:31:18.944 align:middle line:84%
If you -- when you start
mindfully putting this energy

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:23.916 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, it enhances
your healing process,

00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:28.187 align:middle line:84%
or it enhances your
lack of health.

00:31:28.187 --> 00:31:31.123 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely have to work
with a teacher, no question.

00:31:31.123 --> 00:31:33.826 align:middle line:84%
I cannot stress that
enough; okay?

00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Beyond that --

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.197 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how do you do
that though because when you're

00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:40.099 align:middle line:90%
in that orgasmic place,

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:42.368 align:middle line:84%
how do you actually
direct it somewhere?

00:31:42.368 --> 00:31:45.371 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a such
a multilevel,

00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:50.476 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional big huge
thing that how do you --

00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:53.645 align:middle line:84%
how do you redirect it
somewhere or even think of it?

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Well --

00:31:55.047 --> 00:31:57.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because it seems like
the mind is off at that stage.

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:59.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: It is if you've
been having sex the way most

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.821 align:middle line:84%
of us have been trained
to have sex.

00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:06.191 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to treat
this like a martial art

00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:09.962 align:middle line:84%
and train it -- oh, training is
a lot of fun by the way; okay.

00:32:09.962 --> 00:32:11.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Practice.

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:12.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: That is what
I always tell people.

00:32:12.865 --> 00:32:13.999 align:middle line:90%
Do your practice.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:14.633 align:middle line:90%
Do your practice.

00:32:14.633 --> 00:32:15.701 align:middle line:90%
The more --

00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:18.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Come on,
honey, let's do this.

00:32:18.037 --> 00:32:18.937 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: It's true.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:20.205 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:21.807 align:middle line:84%
You know, you find these
funny people out there, well,

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.175 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have
feelings for you but I

00:32:23.175 --> 00:32:24.576 align:middle line:90%
like to do some practice.

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:27.513 align:middle line:84%
Like, yeah, it doesn't
work like that.

00:32:27.513 --> 00:32:31.216 align:middle line:84%
But the more you train
it and I mean there's

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:33.052 align:middle line:84%
so much we're not
talking about and I can't

00:32:33.052 --> 00:32:35.187 align:middle line:84%
because it's in the
lessons; okay.

00:32:35.187 --> 00:32:39.625 align:middle line:84%
But how do you reverse the flow
of that energy so that it goes

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:41.960 align:middle line:84%
up your spine and that's
what happens, by the way.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.697 align:middle line:84%
It's just instead of your body
automatically pushing it out,

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:48.667 align:middle line:84%
your body gets trained to
reverse the contraction

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:50.969 align:middle line:84%
and it just happens very
naturally after a while.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.237 align:middle line:90%
You don't even use muscle.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:53.539 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:57.476 align:middle line:84%
And that shoots up your
spine; goes up into the head.

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:00.546 align:middle line:84%
And the difference, by the
way, the big one between Tantra

00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:03.515 align:middle line:84%
and Tao is Tantra
tends to leave it

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:07.019 align:middle line:84%
up in the head whereas Tao
always brings it back down,

00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:09.555 align:middle line:84%
circulates it and
rests it in the belly.

00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:12.124 align:middle line:84%
We never, ever, ever,
ever let energy just sit

00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:14.059 align:middle line:90%
up in the head like that.

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:17.162 align:middle line:84%
We believe that that
could hurt you

00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen some folks
get a little strange.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.669 align:middle line:84%
It's too much sexual
energy up in the brain.

00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:90%
It is a real thing.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.139 align:middle line:90%
This is not a metaphor; okay.

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:30.375 align:middle line:84%
This that you see here
at 48 years of age,

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:90%
this is not a metaphor.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:84%
This really happened
to me, you know.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.683 align:middle line:90%
So you have to train it.

00:33:37.683 --> 00:33:40.152 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to be mindful.

00:33:40.152 --> 00:33:41.753 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.088 align:middle line:90%
You know, what do I want?

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:45.791 align:middle line:84%
Do I want longevity or do I
want to get rid of a disease

00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:50.162 align:middle line:84%
or maybe what I want to do
today is I'm feeling great;

00:33:50.162 --> 00:33:51.296 align:middle line:90%
my partner's feeling great.

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:53.432 align:middle line:84%
I just want to connect
with my partner.

00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:58.203 align:middle line:84%
So another piece of what we
teach is how to, first of all,

00:33:58.203 --> 00:34:00.105 align:middle line:84%
keep your own energy
in your body

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:01.974 align:middle line:90%
and then choose to share it.

00:34:01.974 --> 00:34:06.378 align:middle line:84%
And there's all these different
formulas and things you can use.

00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:10.615 align:middle line:84%
It all happens in the mind and
then it becomes actualized.

00:34:10.615 --> 00:34:12.651 align:middle line:84%
When you think about a
friend for three days

00:34:12.651 --> 00:34:14.786 align:middle line:84%
and then they call you
because what you think

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.188 align:middle line:90%
about happens; okay?

00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:17.555 align:middle line:90%
And we know this.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:20.057 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is it's sharing
all this stuff with us now.

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:25.764 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm with my lover and
I want to send energy maybe

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:30.068 align:middle line:84%
out from my heart and, you
know, into him into his heart

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:33.905 align:middle line:84%
and then drop the energy down
his body, and pull it back in

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.673 align:middle line:84%
and circulate or
maybe through the eyes

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.642 align:middle line:84%
or the mouth or you
know genitals.

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:40.278 align:middle line:90%
There's like oh, my God.

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:43.615 align:middle line:84%
It just goes on and on, how can
I share energy with my partner.

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.985 align:middle line:84%
There might be another thing
that I would do with my energy.

00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:50.155 align:middle line:84%
Now if my partner was
doing the same thing,

00:34:50.155 --> 00:34:54.258 align:middle line:84%
it definitely changes the
experience but all of us

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:58.263 align:middle line:84%
in the Tao system have had an
experience where we fell in love

00:34:58.263 --> 00:35:02.301 align:middle line:84%
with somebody and they don't
know anything about practice.

00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:05.304 align:middle line:84%
So we sort of do it
for them responsibly.

00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:08.006 align:middle line:84%
I never take somebody's
energy unless I, you know,

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:11.710 align:middle line:84%
have permission and I wouldn't
just take the guy's energy.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.745 align:middle line:90%
I would share energy.

00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:17.082 align:middle line:84%
I would draw in and I would
give back and I would talk

00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:90%
about it before I did it.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:22.754 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I had done recently
this interview on this sexual --

00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of women are
actually sexual healers

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:29.027 align:middle line:84%
and so they would go into those
sex and then they felt depleted

00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:31.763 align:middle line:84%
and totally gave
their energy away.

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:32.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: You mean the healer?

00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:33.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean the woman.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.171 align:middle line:84%
Not feeling in the end
depleted of their energy.

00:35:39.171 --> 00:35:40.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: But she
was the healer?

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:41.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:42.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Okay.

00:35:42.908 --> 00:35:45.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: She went into without
knowing like you were saying

00:35:45.277 --> 00:35:48.313 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of women probably
have sex without knowing

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:90%
and they're sexual healers

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:52.284 align:middle line:84%
and they just give
away their energy.

00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: Yeah.

00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:55.721 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's about training.

00:35:55.721 --> 00:35:58.824 align:middle line:84%
You have to be aware
that that exists.

00:35:58.824 --> 00:36:00.292 align:middle line:90%
It's real; okay.

00:36:00.292 --> 00:36:02.894 align:middle line:84%
It's not a metaphor;
it's real; okay.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And you can get sick.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.632 align:middle line:90%
You know the first thing

00:36:06.632 --> 00:36:09.434 align:middle line:84%
that happens is your mental
state's going to go down.

00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:13.405 align:middle line:84%
And women tend to get
very sad, very lonely.

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:16.241 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice that
after an ejaculation,

00:36:16.241 --> 00:36:19.645 align:middle line:84%
men also energetically
and emotionally go down.

00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:21.713 align:middle line:90%
They will turn their back.

00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:23.282 align:middle line:90%
They'll walk out of the room.

00:36:23.282 --> 00:36:27.786 align:middle line:84%
They become -- sometimes they
become agitated or angry; okay.

00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:33.158 align:middle line:84%
The loss of sexual energy is --
happens as a result of the lack

00:36:33.158 --> 00:36:37.663 align:middle line:84%
of understanding of where
your energy is coming from.

00:36:37.663 --> 00:36:43.302 align:middle line:84%
So if you understood that a man
is depleting his kidneys; okay.

00:36:43.302 --> 00:36:47.072 align:middle line:84%
So you know in an
ejaculation and all

00:36:47.072 --> 00:36:49.641 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden all this weird,
you know, fear comes up

00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:51.643 align:middle line:84%
or they're also going
to deplete liver qi

00:36:51.643 --> 00:36:53.345 align:middle line:90%
and then they get angry.

00:36:53.345 --> 00:36:55.781 align:middle line:84%
So now they're fearful and
they don't want to be intimate

00:36:55.781 --> 00:36:57.916 align:middle line:84%
and they're angry
and they're jerks.

00:36:57.916 --> 00:37:00.385 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And women, we
do this other thing.

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:04.256 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're going to lose
kidney energy but we're going

00:37:04.256 --> 00:37:06.391 align:middle line:84%
to lose more kidney
energy; okay.

00:37:06.391 --> 00:37:13.365 align:middle line:84%
And then we get really fearful
and, you know, and really weird.

00:37:13.365 --> 00:37:17.803 align:middle line:84%
You know, once you understand
that look before you have sex,

00:37:17.803 --> 00:37:20.806 align:middle line:84%
you really need to make sure
that you have balanced emotions

00:37:20.806 --> 00:37:22.574 align:middle line:90%
in all of your organs and that's

00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:26.044 align:middle line:84%
where the body holds emotional
energy is in different organs.

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:29.214 align:middle line:84%
Heart, lungs, liver,
kidneys, spleen, pancreas.

00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:33.852 align:middle line:84%
So you build that up; okay,
first before you have sex.

00:37:33.852 --> 00:37:36.888 align:middle line:90%
Then you want to learn how

00:37:36.888 --> 00:37:40.258 align:middle line:84%
to not just throw your
energy at this person.

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:42.461 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to heal you
and have sex with you.

00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:43.528 align:middle line:90%
No, not really.

00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work like that; okay.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Unless you're a professional,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.902 align:middle line:84%
you don't actually know
what you're doing; okay.

00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:53.138 align:middle line:84%
You have good intention
but, you know,

00:37:53.138 --> 00:37:54.873 align:middle line:84%
that and a dollar
will get you on a bus.

00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:57.576 align:middle line:84%
So what you need
here is knowledge.

00:37:57.576 --> 00:37:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is power.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:01.346 align:middle line:84%
My company's name is
Empowerment Through Knowledge.

00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:03.248 align:middle line:90%
I really believe that.

00:38:03.248 --> 00:38:05.450 align:middle line:84%
If a women was to
just study for --

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean seriously four
weeks, just four weeks.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.325 align:middle line:84%
I understand oh, before I have
sex, I need to build up my qi,

00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:15.761 align:middle line:84%
I need to be very
conscious of my emotions

00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:17.629 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
they're strong.

00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:21.299 align:middle line:84%
Oh, okay. And balance, balance
is a big word here; okay.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:25.003 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, maybe
understand that oh, well,

00:38:25.003 --> 00:38:27.572 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to do is
I'm going to build up close

00:38:27.572 --> 00:38:30.842 align:middle line:84%
to orgasm a few times,
but I'm not actually going

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:34.479 align:middle line:84%
to go all the way and I'm going
to stop and pull this energy

00:38:34.479 --> 00:38:37.282 align:middle line:84%
up into my body, just build
myself up a little bit.

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:38.950 align:middle line:84%
See, maybe do that
two or three times

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.054 align:middle line:90%
and then let the energy out.

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:44.423 align:middle line:90%
That could be interesting.

00:38:44.423 --> 00:38:46.892 align:middle line:84%
But again you know you could
read the books, but you've got

00:38:46.892 --> 00:38:48.994 align:middle line:90%
to study with a living teacher

00:38:48.994 --> 00:38:50.796 align:middle line:84%
because no two women
are the same.

00:38:50.796 --> 00:38:54.032 align:middle line:84%
No two men are the same
and I should be very clear.

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:59.738 align:middle line:84%
I do have products for men but
I'm not actually the only --

00:38:59.738 --> 00:39:03.008 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to like testicle
massage and all that stuff,

00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:05.911 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the person you're
going to see on the video.

00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:07.946 align:middle line:84%
And frankly if you
come to a class,

00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:10.048 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach it
with somebody else.

00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:12.684 align:middle line:84%
Because when it comes to that
part, I choose not to stay

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:13.919 align:middle line:90%
in the room with total strangers

00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that are massaging
their testicles.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.221 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:39:16.221 --> 00:39:17.889 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:39:17.889 --> 00:39:19.357 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like it.

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:24.029 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't my thing so I choose
to have a male come and teach.

00:39:24.029 --> 00:39:25.163 align:middle line:90%
And, you know what?

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
guys working with guys

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:31.403 align:middle line:84%
and a guy can ask a guy question
that only a guy could answer.

00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:33.572 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a prostate.

00:39:33.572 --> 00:39:36.441 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for
me to identify.

00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:36.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:39:36.942 --> 00:39:38.143 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:39:38.143 --> 00:39:39.444 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really, really
enjoyed this conversation

00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and I know we can go on for
hours and hours and hours

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:84%
so deep your knowledge is in
this area so thank you so much.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.152 align:middle line:90%
>> Stone: It was fun.

00:39:47.152 --> 00:39:48.453 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: With this
beautiful tree

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:51.156 align:middle line:84%
in the background I hope you
have enjoyed this video my

00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:52.057 align:middle line:90%
delicious co-creators.

00:39:52.057 --> 00:39:53.592 align:middle line:90%
I mean I know you want more.

00:39:53.592 --> 00:39:56.495 align:middle line:84%
Why not practicing and
reading and getting informed

00:39:56.495 --> 00:39:59.331 align:middle line:84%
and bringing the
knowledge up about this area

00:39:59.331 --> 00:40:03.768 align:middle line:84%
and really seeing it also in a
sacred way, in a very divine way

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.971 align:middle line:90%
and not just sex for sex.

00:40:05.971 --> 00:40:10.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone: At the very least
a little self-respect.

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful, big.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.312 align:middle line:84%
Kisses to you all delicious
co-creators wherever you are

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:15.881 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:17.148 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:90%
