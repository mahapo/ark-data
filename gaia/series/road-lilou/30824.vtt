>> Lilou Mace: Hello
my go greeters,

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:14.648 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here on the
beautiful island of Kauai.

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:16.817 align:middle line:84%
This is a new video
for guide MTV.

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:20.921 align:middle line:84%
An extraordinary video with
the delicious juicy Debra.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: Debra
Silverman brought to you

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:26.894 align:middle line:84%
by Colorado, Kauai,
you name it, I'm there.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:27.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: I love it.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.763 align:middle line:84%
You're such a rock
star, astrologer,

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.465 align:middle line:90%
traveling the world touring.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:35.803 align:middle line:84%
And really bridging, bridging
people with how do you --

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.505 align:middle line:84%
how do you even define
your work?

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:38.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
I bridge them

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:39.707 align:middle line:90%
to the stars back to the earth.

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:42.409 align:middle line:84%
My real passion is connecting
the most spiritual abstract

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.579 align:middle line:84%
ideas back at the ranch in our
bodies, in our relationships.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.747 align:middle line:84%
Like, how do we make
that bridge?

00:00:46.747 --> 00:00:48.549 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
spiritual/smearitual people

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.718 align:middle line:90%
And how do we embody it?

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:52.186 align:middle line:90%
How do we make it practical?

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:55.189 align:middle line:84%
So I bridge the stars
with the earth.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.725 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what happens
right here in aloha land.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.261 align:middle line:84%
Look. We have beauty,
magnificence,

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:90%
and then we've got the laundry.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: We so have
the laundry to take care of.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.902 align:middle line:84%
But we're really going to
go into the four elements

00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
because this is a very Kauai.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.438 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever been in Kauai.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:14.708 align:middle line:84%
This is definitely a place
-- a must visit place.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And the air, the fire,
the earth, the water are

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.016 align:middle line:90%
so present, so vivid here.

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:23.317 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: This
is the Hawaiian culture.

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:24.819 align:middle line:90%
I studied hula for many years.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.455 align:middle line:84%
And hula, the science of hula,
the magic of this land is

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.458 align:middle line:84%
that the Hawaiian's live
in the land and they knew

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.561 align:middle line:84%
that the wisdom came
through our feet,

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.995 align:middle line:84%
through the Ina,
through the earth.

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.497 align:middle line:84%
That the wisdom came
through the breath.

00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:37.798 align:middle line:90%
That it comes from the sun.

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.134 align:middle line:84%
That we can't live without
the radiant fire of the sun.

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:42.369 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have
our air, water, earth,

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.704 align:middle line:90%
and fire to be able to be alive.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:47.208 align:middle line:84%
So really the Hawaiian
culture which was all oral,

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.577 align:middle line:84%
they never wrote anything
down, they passed their stories

00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:52.513 align:middle line:84%
on by being able to have
relationships with the elements.

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:56.617 align:middle line:84%
In fact, aloha means
to breathe together.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.653 align:middle line:84%
So here we are on
this kind island

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:01.422 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
lucky time in history.

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:05.259 align:middle line:84%
This is the most unbelievable
time, 2012, that we are alive

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.994 align:middle line:90%
in an era where we have a chance

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:84%
to actually see the
future coming into form.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.866 align:middle line:84%
At the same time we see
the past disintegrating.

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:13.867 align:middle line:84%
We see the old structures
falling apart.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.403 align:middle line:84%
We talk about bridge
we're between worlds.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.005 align:middle line:90%
Worlds are colliding right now.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.941 align:middle line:84%
And the Hawaiian culture has
this very back to root system.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:21.942 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:23.077 align:middle line:90%
It's grounded.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:25.012 align:middle line:84%
How do we take care of
our family, the ohana,

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.347 align:middle line:90%
they call it in Hawaiian.

00:02:26.347 --> 00:02:28.249 align:middle line:84%
How do we take care
of our bodies.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii they love
to be outside

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.619 align:middle line:90%
with the sun giving you kisses.

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.586 align:middle line:84%
How do we take care
of our relationships?

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:34.955 align:middle line:84%
The most important
conversations.

00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.024 align:middle line:84%
Do we know how to be
kind to each other.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.826 align:middle line:84%
That's very much part
of the Hawaiian culture.

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:40.261 align:middle line:84%
But it's part of the
whole world right now.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:41.061 align:middle line:90%
This is the new era.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:90%
And we're in it right now.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.998 align:middle line:90%
I am. Are you?

00:02:43.998 --> 00:02:45.399 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: I'm
totally feeling it.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And loving it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And those conversations
are so important, I feel,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.872 align:middle line:90%
because it gives us elements.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so -- so let's --

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.843 align:middle line:84%
should we go into the
different elements

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.878 align:middle line:84%
or there's some more
understanding do we --

00:02:57.878 --> 00:02:58.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Well,

00:02:58.913 --> 00:03:00.047 align:middle line:84%
first let's do the
historical backdrop.

00:03:00.047 --> 00:03:01.382 align:middle line:84%
Like we are at a
critical time in history.

00:03:01.382 --> 00:03:03.617 align:middle line:84%
Why is spirituality
so popular right now?

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.487 align:middle line:84%
Why everywhere you go is there
people watching your videos

00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:08.489 align:middle line:84%
and buying those books,
because we know we're

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.857 align:middle line:90%
in this parodyne shift.

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.125 align:middle line:90%
We don't really have language.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.127 align:middle line:84%
Even our parents or our
grandparents if we said to them,

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:14.762 align:middle line:84%
look, it's not like
it used to be.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:17.364 align:middle line:84%
So even though they can't put
language to it everyone knows

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.565 align:middle line:90%
that we're on this precipice

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:19.767 align:middle line:84%
where things are
about to change.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:20.968 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.803 align:middle line:84%
And we're the ones that
are watching these videos

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.738 align:middle line:84%
that are fascinated by the
spirit, that eat these books

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.907 align:middle line:84%
and puts them in the side of
our bed and in our backpacks

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:30.277 align:middle line:84%
because we know we're the ones
heralding in this next era.

00:03:30.277 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:84%
So before we even get back
to basics, the elements,

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.815 align:middle line:84%
first we have to know this
is the time in history

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:36.183 align:middle line:90%
that everyone wanted to be here.

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:37.418 align:middle line:90%
Nine million people.

00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:38.252 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:03:38.252 --> 00:03:39.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Seven million.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
Seven million.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.721 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.788 align:middle line:84%
See I'm adding people
to the equation

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:84%
because the truth is
they are everywhere.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.558 align:middle line:90%
Everyone you ever knew is here.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:45.693 align:middle line:90%
That's my theory.

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:46.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: You're
counting the intangible.

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:47.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
That's right.

00:03:47.528 --> 00:03:48.329 align:middle line:90%
The ones we can't see.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.463 align:middle line:90%
All those invisible spirits.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.998 align:middle line:90%
Everyone you ever knew is here.

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
We're on the edge of our
seats watching a time

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.667 align:middle line:90%
in history we're going to see.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.336 align:middle line:90%
Will we turn this corner?

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.271 align:middle line:84%
Will we actually make
it into the next era

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:58.872 align:middle line:90%
that will be a positive story?

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:00.941 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to see a
disintegration and the ending

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.509 align:middle line:84%
of a story where we
really are broken?

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.611 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is,
it's a good ending.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.613 align:middle line:90%
I have a very positive optimist.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.148 align:middle line:90%
That's the nature of my work.

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:09.183 align:middle line:90%
Giving us hope.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.684 align:middle line:84%
And saying no matter
how bad it gets,

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.953 align:middle line:84%
now matter how scary you
might feel in your own life,

00:04:12.953 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
no matter how vulnerable you are
inside your own psyche this is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.925 align:middle line:84%
all part of the process
of giving birth.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.993 align:middle line:84%
And if you have never seen
a woman give birth before,

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.363 align:middle line:84%
imagine being in a room
where you've never seen it

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:25.499 align:middle line:84%
and you heard her screaming
and crying, and everything

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.201 align:middle line:84%
in your body would
go into terror.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.636 align:middle line:84%
But in the truth if
we had perspective,

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.373 align:middle line:84%
if we could see the long view
we'd go no, no, no, sit still,

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:34.975 align:middle line:84%
take breath, trust,
because at the end

00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:36.642 align:middle line:90%
of this crying fit you're going

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle line:84%
to see the most cutest
little thing you ever saw.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:90%
But who believes that?

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.716 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a very similar
cycle on the planet, 2012.

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:90%
Everything we ever thought

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.054 align:middle line:84%
of what should be doesn't
quite look right, right now.

00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:49.423 align:middle line:84%
But we feel this anticipation
of something burgeoning,

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.592 align:middle line:84%
something growing,
something exciting.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:53.427 align:middle line:90%
But we can't put our hand on it.

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:54.561 align:middle line:90%
We can't touch it yet.

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So all of us listening
and interested in this,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.133 align:middle line:84%
we're the ones that are
responsible, the stewards,

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.568 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the new
by having faith.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.003 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very interesting
words,

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:06.673 align:middle line:84%
the nature of all my work
is turn on your observer,

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.276 align:middle line:84%
look at the long view, and
know that always in history

00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:11.812 align:middle line:84%
across all times we've
come to these moments

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:13.147 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
about the change.

00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:16.417 align:middle line:84%
And if we'd only knew that
it was all going turn okay we

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:17.451 align:middle line:90%
could relax.

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle line:84%
But instead there's
always great chaos

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.687 align:middle line:90%
at turning times of change.

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:25.025 align:middle line:84%
And so the gift of being on this
island is take a breath, trust,

00:05:25.025 --> 00:05:26.727 align:middle line:90%
mother earths got your back.

00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:27.995 align:middle line:90%
There's no reason to be scared.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.963 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a nice thought.

00:05:29.963 --> 00:05:30.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yeah.

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:31.865 align:middle line:90%
We call need that.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:32.866 align:middle line:84%
For now I'm going to bring
you closer because we need

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.401 align:middle line:90%
to squeeze in this little video.

00:05:34.401 --> 00:05:35.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: That's
my favorite thing, cuddling.

00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:36.837 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going
to have to happen.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.106 align:middle line:84%
79 billion people we
just added to the earth.

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:40.707 align:middle line:84%
So there is so many people
here we're got to bump

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
into each other to figure out
how we're going to get along,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.344 align:middle line:84%
and cuddle and snuggle
and get nice

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.547 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
many people here.

00:05:46.547 --> 00:05:48.715 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
they're everywhere.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.618 align:middle line:84%
I love when people say to me as
a psychologist, as a therapist,

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.287 align:middle line:84%
they say, I really
don't like people.

00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:54.688 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, good luck.

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
Because everywhere
you go they're there.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.325 align:middle line:84%
This is a time in history where
we really have to understand

00:05:58.325 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
that everyone is so different.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.995 align:middle line:90%
And if only we had compassion.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:03.597 align:middle line:84%
As an astrologist
this is my gift.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:04.698 align:middle line:90%
We're all so different.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
four elements come in.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.502 align:middle line:84%
We have very different
personality types.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And some really don't
like each other.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.506 align:middle line:84%
And the question is can we
have the big picture in focus.

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
Like you think God
made a mistake

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:90%
when he made what's her name?

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.277 align:middle line:90%
No. She's part of the plan.

00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:18.679 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that but it's true.

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Everyone of your family members,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.315 align:middle line:84%
all the ones that
really bug you.

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The people that you
really find offensive.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:90%
That's part of the plan.

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:25.819 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mistake.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:26.954 align:middle line:90%
It's a radical thought.

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:28.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yeah.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: And
it creates compassion.

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And by
embracing our awkwardness

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:34.394 align:middle line:84%
or how different we are from
others then we are just being

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:90%
and we're not forcing things.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.866 align:middle line:84%
It just flows and everything
starts to fall into place.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: It's true.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:41.435 align:middle line:84%
And think about the
person that really bugs you

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:43.871 align:middle line:84%
or the family member that always
irritates you or the mother

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.405 align:middle line:84%
or father that really
bugged you.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:46.106 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.174 align:middle line:90%
They really do bug you.

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.541 align:middle line:84%
You can't take -- you
can't be spiritual

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and go no, no, love everyone.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.478 align:middle line:90%
No. That person bugs you.

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:54.114 align:middle line:84%
But how do I have the right
relationship with that person

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:55.949 align:middle line:90%
if nothing else, in my head.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.184 align:middle line:90%
Like how do I give thanks

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:59.253 align:middle line:84%
that they exist even though
they really are strange.

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:00.454 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to have
dinner with them.

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to invite
them over into my house.

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.458 align:middle line:84%
But I do have to
internally come to peace

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with this is the
nature of the beast.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.461 align:middle line:84%
This is the nature
of this planet.

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:09.396 align:middle line:84%
We're all on one
planet at the same time.

00:07:09.396 --> 00:07:13.133 align:middle line:84%
And the question is who has the
wisdom to accept the differences

00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle line:84%
and find the right
relationships.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:16.069 align:middle line:84%
Which can mean never
talking to them.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:18.639 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one who says
love everyone.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.339 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:20.274 align:middle line:90%
I mean that was Jesus.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:21.642 align:middle line:90%
He was one of our archetypes

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:23.544 align:middle line:84%
that represented
unconditional love.

00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's something to aspire
towards, but back at the ranch

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.849 align:middle line:84%
when someone bugs you the
best thing you can do is turn

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.117 align:middle line:90%
on your observer and go wow.

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:32.119 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning into
that meanny again.

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.721 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:36.056 align:middle line:90%
Open up my heart.

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:37.224 align:middle line:90%
Slow down a little bit.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:90%
Make some space.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.127 align:middle line:84%
And then be able to find
the right relationship

00:07:40.127 --> 00:07:43.196 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's going
to be required in these times.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And all
the prophesies really

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
where speaking about
those times.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.771 align:middle line:84%
Did they all have happy
endings or is it your own sense?

00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:51.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
That's my take on it.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:54.174 align:middle line:84%
There's a very strong
under current

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:56.276 align:middle line:84%
in the unconscious right
now on this planet.

00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:58.679 align:middle line:84%
Especially in Hollywood
where we saw that film.

00:07:58.679 --> 00:07:59.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Oh, yeah, 2012.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: 2012.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:02.449 align:middle line:90%
That there's this dark side.

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:04.518 align:middle line:84%
That we're going to somehow
or other destroy ourselves.

00:08:04.518 --> 00:08:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the unconscious
would love us to believe.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.221 align:middle line:84%
That's the dark side
of this planet.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:11.091 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is there's
an invisible force field.

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:12.559 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's a
creative intelligence.

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:13.794 align:middle line:90%
And we can't understand it.

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.162 align:middle line:84%
Because if we -- I
always say if they were

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:16.663 align:middle line:84%
so intelligent why
are they so mean?

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.632 align:middle line:84%
Why would they allow
this much free will?

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:21.568 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is there's
a design working itself out.

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And there is an organic mastery.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.306 align:middle line:84%
There's a creative intelligence
far beyond my understanding.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:84%
As an astrologer
I can say to you

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.078 align:middle line:84%
without question every
single chart I look at,

00:08:31.078 --> 00:08:33.880 align:middle line:84%
every single chart,
there is a design.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.382 align:middle line:90%
You are playing your part.

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:37.284 align:middle line:84%
It may not seem at
all comfortable.

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:39.585 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though
you're somehow awkward

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.654 align:middle line:84%
as you were saying
where you might feel

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:41.655 align:middle line:90%
like you're missing the boat.

00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:42.656 align:middle line:90%
I always hear this.

00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.858 align:middle line:84%
Why am I not doing
what I came to do?

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Why do I not have a partner?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.162 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe this life you are
learning about being single.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:50.464 align:middle line:84%
Or why am I in this
relationship?

00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:51.431 align:middle line:90%
I can't get out of it.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:52.366 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe you are
here to learn

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:53.767 align:middle line:84%
about the karma of
relationships.

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:56.937 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee you everything
is working out as it should be

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.306 align:middle line:84%
because that's what you learn
when your study astrology.

00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:84%
That it's masterfully
done from the top down.

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:04.378 align:middle line:90%
There's a brilliant design.

00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
But from the bottom up,
from the human dimension,

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:84%
as far as our way of relating
we are a little goofy.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:10.617 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand if you're goofy.

00:09:10.617 --> 00:09:12.719 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look, everyone is
raising their hands.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:14.488 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
quirky personalities

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:84%
but at the soul level, at
the quintessential level

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:20.527 align:middle line:84%
of the designer of
the divine creator.

00:09:20.527 --> 00:09:23.697 align:middle line:84%
If you look outside you
see there is absolute

00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:25.232 align:middle line:90%
humbling mastery.

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:29.169 align:middle line:84%
But from the human dimension
with our minds we're confused.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.071 align:middle line:90%
And it's awkward.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.439 align:middle line:90%
And that's okay.

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:35.208 align:middle line:84%
It's like saying why are
kids so mean to each other?

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Why do they bump
into each other?

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.377 align:middle line:90%
Why do they trip?

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.012 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they walk
the first time?

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:40.414 align:middle line:90%
Because they are evolving.

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:43.283 align:middle line:84%
But if you're an adult and you
have the wisdom to witness that

00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:45.218 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, I have
so much compassion,

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:90%
look they fell down again.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.288 align:middle line:84%
Look they're grabbing
each others hair.

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:49.623 align:middle line:90%
Can I just help you?

00:09:49.623 --> 00:09:50.857 align:middle line:84%
Can we not sit so
close together,

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:51.925 align:middle line:90%
you two, you don't get along.

00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:52.859 align:middle line:90%
It's okay though.

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:53.694 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you go
in the other room.

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:55.028 align:middle line:90%
Or why don't we talk about it.

00:09:55.028 --> 00:09:58.098 align:middle line:84%
So there is this natural
dynamic in the human condition.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
That we are funny, awkward even.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.868 align:middle line:90%
What's the word, uncomfortable.

00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle line:90%
And then there's the divine part

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
where we're absolutely
beautiful.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.108 align:middle line:84%
And you look in the eye of
a baby you've never seen

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.176 align:middle line:90%
and you think it's yours.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:11.178 align:middle line:90%
You're like look at that soul.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So there's this conflicting
contrasting reality

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.151 align:middle line:84%
between the divine and the
stars and the perfect heavens

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.754 align:middle line:84%
and then back at the ranch
the pollution, the confusion,

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.723 align:middle line:90%
the money, the politics.

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.125 align:middle line:84%
It's ridiculous and
they coexist.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:27.327 align:middle line:84%
And it's only from the
observers point of view

00:10:27.327 --> 00:10:31.264 align:middle line:84%
which is what astrology does
is we step back and go oh.

00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
From the observers point of
view you see the human condition

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.635 align:middle line:90%
and you go they're cute.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.803 align:middle line:90%
They're trying.

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:37.804 align:middle line:90%
They're sincere.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:38.905 align:middle line:90%
They all have a heart.

00:10:38.905 --> 00:10:41.575 align:middle line:84%
And they're all evolving
at a very slow pace.

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:42.909 align:middle line:90%
Well, not all of them.

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.212 align:middle line:84%
Some of you watch and this
has done all the work you can.

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:48.615 align:middle line:84%
Spiritually ambitious,
starving to learn more,

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.318 align:middle line:84%
following through, taking
care of your body, your diet,

00:10:51.318 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:84%
your health, your kids,
and some of you are sitting

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.058 align:middle line:84%
on the couch going do I
have to go do that exercise?

00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.392 align:middle line:90%
I really don't want to eat that.

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.228 align:middle line:90%
I just want the potato chip.

00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:04.364 align:middle line:84%
So there is a different range
of how much will do we have.

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.799 align:middle line:90%
How much discipline do we have.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:08.268 align:middle line:84%
How much ambition do we have
to get ourselves driven.

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:09.636 align:middle line:90%
And there's no judgments.

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:12.072 align:middle line:84%
Some people have come
through a series of lifetimes

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.541 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the word,
karma, or their childhood

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:16.176 align:middle line:90%
where they're just tired.

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.711 align:middle line:84%
And others come in
going I can't wait,

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.112 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait, I'm so excited.

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:20.781 align:middle line:90%
And my job as an astrologer is

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.049 align:middle line:84%
to say you're just
right where you are.

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle line:84%
If I can help move you just
a little bit more towards the

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.623 align:middle line:84%
aspiration of your soul
then I'll have done my job.

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:31.925 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really tired
and you're really weary

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:35.095 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling really sad
then let me just let you rest

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:35.929 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:11:35.929 --> 00:11:36.997 align:middle line:90%
You know, let me just touch you.

00:11:36.997 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't change
your dark sadness

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:40.267 align:middle line:84%
but I can certainly
be compassionate.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:44.538 align:middle line:84%
And that's really all that
this planet is starving for,

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.206 align:middle line:84%
is the compassion
of wisdom to know

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:90%
that we're all in this together.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:48.909 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: With
our unique imprint,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.045 align:middle line:90%
with our unique blue print.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: So
let's talk about that.

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:56.082 align:middle line:84%
So water people, they get
depressed because of this story.

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.484 align:middle line:84%
They're listening and
going it's so true.

00:11:57.484 --> 00:11:59.619 align:middle line:90%
I don't really like it here.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:02.155 align:middle line:84%
I just want to stay
home and I feel so sad.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden I'm
getting tired.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.325 align:middle line:90%
Where is my cigarette.

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:07.127 align:middle line:90%
I just need a cup of coffee.

00:12:07.127 --> 00:12:08.695 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones
that are sensitives.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:09.729 align:middle line:90%
And they want go away.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:10.597 align:middle line:90%
And they want to be alone.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:11.531 align:middle line:90%
And they need to be quite.

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.732 align:middle line:90%
And they want to have music on.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.934 align:middle line:84%
And they just want to
have their family around.

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:15.135 align:middle line:90%
And people bug them.

00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:18.238 align:middle line:84%
But their gift in the name
of this big change we're

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.639 align:middle line:90%
in is just to be still.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:22.742 align:middle line:84%
And to except that
meditation has a role.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.544 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
don't have to do.

00:12:24.544 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people that really
-- you love to cuddle with them.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:90%
You love to be at their house.

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:29.216 align:middle line:90%
They want to cook for you.

00:12:29.216 --> 00:12:31.017 align:middle line:84%
They want to make
you feel comforted.

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.352 align:middle line:90%
They have a very gentle spirit.

00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't talk as fast as me.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.921 align:middle line:90%
They're much slower.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.223 align:middle line:90%
They're very kind.

00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:38.358 align:middle line:84%
They love animals and kids
and people that don't talk.

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:40.393 align:middle line:84%
And they want to turn the
volume off on the television

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:41.928 align:middle line:84%
and the music because
they just want quite.

00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:44.631 align:middle line:84%
And those people get
prone to depression.

00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:45.765 align:middle line:90%
And addiction.

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.834 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't find
comfort in this world.

00:12:47.834 --> 00:12:48.535 align:middle line:90%
That's water.

00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:51.171 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio, Cancer, Pisces.

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle line:84%
Then the air people, like
myself, they love to talk.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:56.243 align:middle line:84%
So they're the one
that is entertain us.

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:57.611 align:middle line:90%
They think about things all day.

00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:00.013 align:middle line:84%
They go on to the computer and
they get books and they read

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:01.848 align:middle line:84%
and they watch the U
tubes and they can't wait

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:04.284 align:middle line:84%
to get information and they
call people up and they forget

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:05.919 align:middle line:84%
who they called and they
don't know where they're going

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:84%
and they can't find their
keys, and they're air heads.

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.357 align:middle line:84%
And they're the very fun
entertaining characters.

00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:11.458 align:middle line:90%
And they're function

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:13.226 align:middle line:84%
on the planet right
now is to stimulate us.

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.394 align:middle line:90%
To ask the questions.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:15.896 align:middle line:90%
To have the conversations.

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:18.098 align:middle line:84%
To say if you two aren't getting
along let me just ask you a

00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:90%
few questions.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.267 align:middle line:90%
Can we talk about this?

00:13:20.267 --> 00:13:21.534 align:middle line:90%
First get it where water is

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
like if you two aren't
getting along let's just leave.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.604 align:middle line:90%
We'll just be quite.

00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:25.839 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
be around people.

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:84%
So there's a difference
in the response.

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:30.644 align:middle line:84%
That's the air people are
Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.279 align:middle line:90%
And they just love information.

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And they love Facebook.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.648 align:middle line:90%
And they love the internet.

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:35.916 align:middle line:90%
And they love telephones.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:37.284 align:middle line:90%
And they're the ones

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.686 align:middle line:84%
that entertain themselves all
day inside their own heads.

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:41.087 align:middle line:90%
So they're fun factor.

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:43.523 align:middle line:90%
Then third category is earth.

00:13:43.523 --> 00:13:46.393 align:middle line:84%
That's Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn,
and they're very grounded.

00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:48.194 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones
that get things done.

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.129 align:middle line:90%
They build things.

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.863 align:middle line:90%
That I have make things.

00:13:49.863 --> 00:13:50.730 align:middle line:90%
They count the money.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.698 align:middle line:90%
They get the schedule.

00:13:51.698 --> 00:13:52.632 align:middle line:90%
They get structure.

00:13:52.632 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:90%
They love to have the food.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.734 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
if it is organic.

00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:55.702 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
where it was built.

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:90%
They look at the labels

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.737 align:middle line:84%
and they're walking
through whole foods.

00:13:57.737 --> 00:13:58.505 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
can we just buy it?

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.306 align:middle line:90%
Nope. You've got to read.

00:13:59.306 --> 00:14:00.707 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look, that's not right.

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:02.542 align:middle line:90%
They have incredible detail.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.811 align:middle line:84%
They're always trying to get
things done and their value

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
in this life is to be
able to be practical.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:84%
So if the first category water
is compassion and kindness

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:11.651 align:middle line:90%
and meditation and stillness.

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:14.521 align:middle line:84%
And the second category,
air, is stimulating thoughts.

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:15.956 align:middle line:90%
Getting us all really active

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.257 align:middle line:84%
like I'm doing right
here right now.

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:18.325 align:middle line:90%
Making your mind work.

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:19.759 align:middle line:90%
And the earth people are trying

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.594 align:middle line:84%
to keep the whole
world glued together.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:22.495 align:middle line:90%
Like do we have money?

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:23.463 align:middle line:90%
Is the insurance in place?

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:24.297 align:middle line:90%
Are your tires good?

00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:25.665 align:middle line:90%
How's the car?

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Really that's what we're going
to talk about, says the air

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.401 align:middle line:84%
to the earth, that
sounds so boring.

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:30.236 align:middle line:84%
But they're trying to keep
the boring world intact.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:32.505 align:middle line:90%
And the last category is fire.

00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:33.907 align:middle line:90%
And that's Aries, Leo, and Sag.

00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:36.676 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that go,
oh, I have this amazing idea.

00:14:36.676 --> 00:14:39.346 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to travel all over
and get everybody inspired.

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:41.014 align:middle line:84%
She's smiling because
we know what she is.

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.916 align:middle line:84%
And they want to get
everybody activated.

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:45.752 align:middle line:84%
And they want to get everybody
really honest and not talk

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:48.421 align:middle line:84%
about anything but really
gets people inspired.

00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:49.923 align:middle line:90%
So it's spirituality.

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:51.091 align:middle line:90%
It's physicality.

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:52.158 align:middle line:90%
It's athletics.

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's entertainment.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.962 align:middle line:84%
It's standing on the stage
and going wake up everyone.

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:57.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: It's artists too.

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:58.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Artists.

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:01.267 align:middle line:84%
Passionate characters
who really have a desire

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:04.237 align:middle line:84%
to impact the world
without it being sleepy.

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:06.272 align:middle line:84%
So you can see how the
first category water

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:07.774 align:middle line:90%
and fire can be conflicted.

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:09.376 align:middle line:84%
Because the water
is going shhhhh

00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.478 align:middle line:84%
and the fire is getting
the music up and wants

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:12.846 align:middle line:84%
to have a party and
drink a little bit more

00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:13.747 align:middle line:90%
and eat a little bit more.

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.081 align:middle line:90%
And let's travel a little bit.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.883 align:middle line:84%
And the air person is
going that's a great idea.

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.952 align:middle line:84%
And the earth is going how
much is this going to cost?

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.086 align:middle line:90%
How long is this going to take?

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:21.688 align:middle line:84%
And is there any value
to what you're doing?

00:15:21.688 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So these are the four
personality types.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.726 align:middle line:84%
Fire is clearly here
to get us inspired

00:15:26.726 --> 00:15:28.795 align:middle line:90%
and to say do not get limited.

00:15:28.795 --> 00:15:29.896 align:middle line:90%
That's fire.

00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:31.798 align:middle line:84%
Like if anything goes
wrong it's all okay.

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:90%
Because we'll turn it around.

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.735 align:middle line:84%
Earth person is going how
much is it going to cost?

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:37.604 align:middle line:84%
They air person is going
can we research this?

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.172 align:middle line:84%
And the water person
is going I'm scared.

00:15:39.172 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:90%
We need therapy.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:40.974 align:middle line:90%
Can we get some help?

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.108 align:middle line:90%
Let's meditate.

00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.643 align:middle line:84%
We'll just get quite and
we'll get to heal this.

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:45.445 align:middle line:84%
So there are all these
different personality types

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.514 align:middle line:90%
and you can see them vividly.

00:15:47.514 --> 00:15:49.716 align:middle line:84%
But the question is
which one are you.

00:15:49.716 --> 00:15:52.786 align:middle line:84%
And how can you get comfortable
with the ones that aren't you.

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
big challenge.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And can
we be a bit of it all?

00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:56.956 align:middle line:90%
Because --

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Yes.

00:15:58.058 --> 00:15:59.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: -- we
recognize ourselves --

00:15:59.025 --> 00:15:59.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
You can't live

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:01.061 align:middle line:84%
without water, air,
earth, or fire.

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:02.562 align:middle line:84%
You can't live wouldn't
water every day.

00:16:02.562 --> 00:16:04.831 align:middle line:84%
You can't live without air
for longer then a few minutes.

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:05.732 align:middle line:90%
You can't live wouldn't food.

00:16:05.732 --> 00:16:06.599 align:middle line:90%
You can't live without the sun.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.635 align:middle line:90%
So yes, we're all four of them.

00:16:08.635 --> 00:16:10.537 align:middle line:90%
But there's a predominance.

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:13.106 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
which one are you?

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:14.474 align:middle line:90%
How do you get comfortable?

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.744 align:middle line:84%
If you're kid is one of those
kids that talks all the time

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:21.314 align:middle line:84%
and you keep telling your kid
to stop you're squishing them.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:22.949 align:middle line:84%
If you're kid doesn't talk
-- that would beer error.

00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:24.851 align:middle line:84%
If your kid doesn't
talk and he's very quite

00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and he's very gentle and he gets
sensitive and he cries easily

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.457 align:middle line:84%
and you tell him to stop
crying you're squishing him.

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:34.027 align:middle line:84%
So the question is how do we
cultivate permission to say

00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:36.429 align:middle line:84%
to each of our children,
to each of our spouses,

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:37.597 align:middle line:90%
like, I want you to be you.

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:39.265 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to change you.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But I really would
love to understand you.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.869 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing that I
love most about my work.

00:16:42.869 --> 00:16:46.473 align:middle line:84%
Is going deep and really
understanding who are you.

00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:47.807 align:middle line:90%
What are you made out of?

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.075 align:middle line:90%
What's the nature of your kind?

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:51.344 align:middle line:84%
And how do I tickle you to
realize you're just funny.

00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:53.246 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not as
serious as you think you are.

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:56.382 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets so caught in
their dramas or their story

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.719 align:middle line:84%
or their accomplishments and
their success and their failure

00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:90%
and how do I look honey.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.623 align:middle line:84%
You know, jeez, really, is that
what we're going to talk about?

00:17:03.623 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's go on the inside.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.159 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little
window view of your soul

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.195 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't care how
much money you made.

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care what
you look like.

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.499 align:middle line:84%
It just wants to
know do you love?

00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And are you loved?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.668 align:middle line:84%
And do you know how to
cuddle with the dog?

00:17:15.668 --> 00:17:17.302 align:middle line:84%
That's really what the
soul wants to know.

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.471 align:middle line:90%
The soul is an animal

00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:19.772 align:middle line:84%
and animals really
shows up in souls.

00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:23.376 align:middle line:84%
But the soul just wants
to know are you kind?

00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:26.044 align:middle line:84%
Like, can you be compassionate
for the human condition?

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.748 align:middle line:84%
Can you sit quitely
with your own thoughts?

00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:30.717 align:middle line:84%
Can you rest in the
empty and not feel

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.719 align:middle line:90%
like you're not doing anything?

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:34.154 align:middle line:90%
Can you not judge yourself?

00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the biggest things
I see all the time in my work.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.324 align:middle line:84%
People come to see me,
I look at their chart,

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:40.994 align:middle line:84%
I start describing it and
they're like, oh, you got me.

00:17:40.994 --> 00:17:43.196 align:middle line:84%
But they're not saying
it like, do you like me?

00:17:43.196 --> 00:17:45.265 align:middle line:84%
They're more like I
don't know why I do that.

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:48.201 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking of a
client right now who --

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:51.137 align:middle line:84%
she came to see me and
she really had a pattern

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:54.374 align:middle line:84%
of being successful, hugely
successful in this life.

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.376 align:middle line:84%
But never feeling like she was
ever getting anything done.

00:17:56.376 --> 00:17:57.076 align:middle line:90%
This is earth.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.144 align:middle line:90%
So accomplishment.

00:17:58.144 --> 00:18:00.113 align:middle line:84%
So oriented to get
the goal done.

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:01.514 align:middle line:90%
But never satisfied?

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And never feeling, you know,
the feeling of oh I'm so --

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.886 align:middle line:84%
so I got to say to her
hold on, can we make a list

00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:09.355 align:middle line:84%
and see what you've done and
take moment from the souls point

00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:11.958 align:middle line:90%
of view to say thank you.

00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.359 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
she relaxed and I was

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.961 align:middle line:84%
like you could do
nothing else in this life,

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:16.529 align:middle line:90%
you could just stop right here

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.364 align:middle line:84%
and you've accomplished
huge feats.

00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:21.167 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is can
you take the inner journey

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.836 align:middle line:90%
and be at peace?

00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
That's when the real
challenge begins

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.672 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
the planet will demand.

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:27.006 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be
getting a thinner

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:28.741 align:middle line:84%
and thinner amount
of distractions.

00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:30.577 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have
the same abundance we used

00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:32.979 align:middle line:84%
to have financially to
fly all over the world

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.115 align:middle line:84%
and change our food and be able
to get in our cars and drive.

00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.117 align:middle line:84%
We're going have to
come back to basics.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.452 align:middle line:90%
Water, air, earth, and fire.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.721 align:middle line:90%
How do I deal with quiet?

00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:44.624 align:middle line:84%
Can I rest in the
stillness, that's water.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:46.726 align:middle line:84%
What are my conversations
like with my relationships?

00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:48.928 align:middle line:84%
Do I tell the truth
to my partner?

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:51.231 align:middle line:84%
Do I know how to communicate in
a way that I can say, you know,

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:53.867 align:middle line:84%
this really bugs me about you
but I want so much to be close.

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:56.536 align:middle line:84%
Can we talk about this without
me getting you mad at me.

00:18:56.536 --> 00:18:58.738 align:middle line:90%
Wow. There's an art form.

00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:02.108 align:middle line:84%
Can I actually deal with my body
and treat it well and know what

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:05.044 align:middle line:84%
to eat and not be compelled
to eat what's not good for me

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.613 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so emotionally
distraught

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:09.249 align:middle line:84%
that I've actually
respecting my body

00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:11.985 align:middle line:84%
and eating healthy food
because I choose too.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.486 align:middle line:90%
That's radical.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.689 align:middle line:84%
Because the impulse on this
planet with the under belly

00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:18.691 align:middle line:84%
of thinking something
so wrong here.

00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't think people admit it.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But unconsciously at the subtle
levels there's a deep worry

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.698 align:middle line:84%
that everyone suffers
from like are we going

00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:26.666 align:middle line:90%
to make it around this corner?

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:28.601 align:middle line:90%
Is America going to fall apart?

00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:32.272 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have an
economy that's going to survive?

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:34.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: But also
with that comes, well,

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
then I might as well
just give up.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Right.

00:19:37.944 --> 00:19:39.245 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
have lost hope.

00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:41.547 align:middle line:84%
People -- see the people you
speak to and we're talking

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.951 align:middle line:84%
to now there's an excitement
about wanting to be awake.

00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:46.619 align:middle line:90%
Like let's tell the truth.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:47.487 align:middle line:90%
Let's be conscious.

00:19:47.487 --> 00:19:48.554 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if we can't help.

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:49.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And
then you get closer.

00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:51.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: I love it.

00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:55.428 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Because she keeps
on -- Debra keeps on going --

00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:56.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
I'm bringing her close.

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.232 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole bunch of
people that are watching this

00:19:59.232 --> 00:20:02.068 align:middle line:84%
that are generally
interested and able to find it

00:20:02.068 --> 00:20:04.237 align:middle line:84%
in themselves to read
the books, do the work,

00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:06.306 align:middle line:84%
nd eat the healthy
food for a while.

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:07.507 align:middle line:84%
But then they suffer
because they think

00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.375 align:middle line:84%
that they're not really
getting enough done.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Like did I really help?

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.878 align:middle line:90%
Am I really making a difference?

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:90%
Especially men.

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:90%
That's even harder.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.548 align:middle line:90%
The women feel powerful.

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:16.983 align:middle line:90%
That we're contributing.

00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:18.384 align:middle line:90%
But the men feel like, really,

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:20.586 align:middle line:84%
have I really made
a difference there?

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.822 align:middle line:84%
Is this planet going to be
ruined because I didn't know

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:23.856 align:middle line:90%
where my leadership was?

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:24.924 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what I could do

00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:26.726 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference
to the economy?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:84%
Make a difference
to the environment?

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:30.129 align:middle line:84%
So there's a despondency
or depression

00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:31.664 align:middle line:90%
but they don't say it.

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:34.901 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to say is that's
not your job on the outer world

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to change the furniture
or rearrange the ecology.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.707 align:middle line:84%
Look when your on this island
and you see mother earth

00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.742 align:middle line:90%
so happy, it's organic.

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.111 align:middle line:84%
This is happening because
it's a natural flow.

00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:47.347 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to be in
distress right now.

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:49.315 align:middle line:90%
All the profits predicted this.

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:51.284 align:middle line:90%
We're not -- nothing is wrong.

00:20:51.284 --> 00:20:53.886 align:middle line:84%
It's just that analogy, if
you saw a woman giving birth

00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:56.489 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't know, can
you imagine being in a room

00:20:56.489 --> 00:20:58.925 align:middle line:84%
where she is screaming
and yelling

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.893 align:middle line:84%
and she's got this
thing on her tummy.

00:21:00.893 --> 00:21:02.929 align:middle line:90%
And it looks so weird.

00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:05.865 align:middle line:84%
Do you think anybody in the room
would have the wisdom to say no,

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:10.036 align:middle line:84%
no, honestly, take
breath, it's okay.

00:21:10.036 --> 00:21:12.004 align:middle line:84%
So similarly we get
this impulse,

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.639 align:middle line:84%
particularly the male
side in all of us

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.007 align:middle line:90%
who want to make difference.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.043 align:middle line:84%
And that's important to be an
activist and to do something

00:21:17.043 --> 00:21:18.678 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
you love to do.

00:21:18.678 --> 00:21:22.081 align:middle line:84%
But just know that at the
highest level there's an organic

00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.983 align:middle line:84%
out working here
that is occurring

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:27.253 align:middle line:84%
because you're studying,
you're reading,

00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:29.789 align:middle line:84%
you're consciousness is
shifting, you're wanting

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.391 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference
whether it's raking,

00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.226 align:middle line:84%
whether it's helping the
neighbor, whether it's going

00:21:33.226 --> 00:21:35.328 align:middle line:84%
and volunteering, whether
it's having a friend you

00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:84%
like whose three years old
that you give cuddles to,

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.299 align:middle line:84%
whether it's taking care of
your kid and saying I really get

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:41.768 align:middle line:84%
who you are and the
kid walks to school

00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:44.704 align:middle line:84%
that morning going
my mom loves me.

00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:46.039 align:middle line:90%
Like that's the smallest --

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.341 align:middle line:84%
those are the smallest
deepest impacts

00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.642 align:middle line:84%
that you can make
on this planet.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.612 align:middle line:84%
And we really can't at the
moment figure out yet how

00:21:52.612 --> 00:21:53.746 align:middle line:90%
to change the climate.

00:21:53.746 --> 00:21:55.648 align:middle line:90%
Is there people making efforts?

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.916 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to give
our money to that?

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.619 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Are there people
who know their calling?

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:02.255 align:middle line:84%
But not everyone has a
deep profound calling to go

00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:04.891 align:middle line:84%
on the television and
do guide radio or do --

00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
like we happen to have a
particular destiny line,

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:90%
lucky us.

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:11.898 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many students
I have who passionately study

00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:13.366 align:middle line:84%
and they don't feel like
they are doing enough.

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:15.134 align:middle line:84%
And I always want to
say, like, you are.

00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:18.738 align:middle line:84%
Just by your sincere interest
in being kind and taking care

00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:21.607 align:middle line:84%
of the laundry and being back
at the ranch with simplicity,

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
and making fun of yourself
and finding the joy.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:27.079 align:middle line:90%
What a gift to be enjoyed.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:29.482 align:middle line:84%
But it's not easy when
the under current --

00:22:29.482 --> 00:22:30.616 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do you feel it?

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:32.084 align:middle line:84%
Are you aware of that --
your mood is a Scorpio.

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.286 align:middle line:90%
You must have a sense.

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:36.255 align:middle line:84%
You must have a sensitivity
to that darker side.

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:37.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yes.

00:22:37.089 --> 00:22:40.626 align:middle line:90%
I do and it's I think we all do.

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:43.396 align:middle line:84%
And that it's -- we have
to really be with it.

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:90%
And it's good to face it also.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.733 align:middle line:90%
It's empowering to face it.

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:51.404 align:middle line:84%
As it inspires me to
go further and to --

00:22:51.404 --> 00:22:52.939 align:middle line:90%
it gives me a lot of energy too.

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:55.875 align:middle line:84%
So good or bad -- a lot
of people say, well,

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:58.511 align:middle line:84%
good or bad at the end you
just have to see it as it is.

00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:00.746 align:middle line:90%
And not put so much emotion.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:01.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: So
when there's depression

00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:03.716 align:middle line:84%
or when there's sadness
or when there's, you know,

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.751 align:middle line:90%
fear we just be honest.

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.421 align:middle line:84%
This is the spiritual
path in its truest.

00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
You face it and then you use
it as motivation to get up

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.258 align:middle line:90%
and take another breath.

00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:14.427 align:middle line:84%
And say today I'm going
to put some music on.

00:23:14.427 --> 00:23:16.229 align:middle line:84%
I'm going go outside and I'm
going to find some friend.

00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.297 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put my drums on
I'm going put my dance shoes on.

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it takes
to shift the energy.

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:23.169 align:middle line:90%
So yes there's an under current.

00:23:23.169 --> 00:23:25.371 align:middle line:84%
And yes we have to power
to change the energy.

00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:26.572 align:middle line:90%
Which is what I do all day.

00:23:26.572 --> 00:23:29.242 align:middle line:84%
Every where I go my chance
to see who I can tickle.

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:30.443 align:middle line:90%
Who I can make giggle.

00:23:30.443 --> 00:23:32.578 align:middle line:84%
How I can find some little
kid that I can smile at.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:35.715 align:middle line:84%
Like, if we're going to spend
the next how many million years

00:23:35.715 --> 00:23:40.386 align:middle line:84%
on this planet why not activate
by being the one that blesses.

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:42.922 align:middle line:84%
You know, finding out where
I can actually contribute

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.624 align:middle line:90%
by being myself.

00:23:44.624 --> 00:23:47.093 align:middle line:84%
So if it's being
quite then be quite

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:84%
and let there be a vibration
that comes off the water people.

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:51.531 align:middle line:84%
The Cancers, the
Pisces, the Scorpios.

00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:52.431 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to talk.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And they can snuggle.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.501 align:middle line:84%
And they can care for
the ones they love.

00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:56.903 align:middle line:84%
And they can put their
arms and touch them.

00:23:56.903 --> 00:23:59.338 align:middle line:84%
We love being touched
if we're water signs.

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:01.207 align:middle line:84%
And if it's air people then
you're the ones who are suppose

00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:03.543 align:middle line:84%
to go on the internet and
send those funny little cards

00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:05.077 align:middle line:84%
and send the little
things in the mail

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:06.445 align:middle line:84%
with the stamp and
the stickers on.

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.614 align:middle line:84%
And go on-line and figure
out who you can talk

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:09.715 align:middle line:90%
to today on the telephone.

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:11.384 align:middle line:90%
Then communicate with us.

00:24:11.384 --> 00:24:12.718 align:middle line:90%
Give us the voice of happiness.

00:24:12.718 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Show us that you care.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:84%
And if it's earth go ahead
garden your heart out.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.224 align:middle line:84%
Go figure out how
you can make money.

00:24:18.224 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:84%
And share your money
and contribute

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.695 align:middle line:84%
and really work and
love your work.

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:25.364 align:middle line:84%
Great. And if it's
fire then inspire us.

00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:27.466 align:middle line:84%
And get in your body and
make sure your physical.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
for fire people

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:32.171 align:middle line:84%
to make sure every day they
move energy through their body.

00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:35.274 align:middle line:84%
Sexual energy, physical
energy, sports, you know,

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:38.844 align:middle line:84%
making sure that we -- we
each have a role by nature

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.813 align:middle line:84%
of our chart and
our personality.

00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:43.316 align:middle line:84%
But it's the curious
part that we judge

00:24:43.316 --> 00:24:46.752 align:middle line:84%
or get uncomfortable thinking
that, oh, I talk to much.

00:24:46.752 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And you're to excitable.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.755 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, that one he's
just a stick in the mud.

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:51.123 align:middle line:90%
And she's so depressed.

00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:54.493 align:middle line:84%
Like, why would we want to judge
the most instinctual natural

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.963 align:middle line:90%
nature of this beautiful planet

00:24:56.963 --> 00:24:59.599 align:middle line:84%
because we don't think
it's the way it should be.

00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:90%
The mind is the culprit.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.605 align:middle line:84%
If there's one contribution
that I can say that I would pray

00:25:05.605 --> 00:25:08.641 align:middle line:84%
that in the wisdom of the future
as the profits become more

00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and more visible and they give
their voice louder and louder

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.246 align:middle line:84%
and the waves of the
future of 2020-2030,

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.082 align:middle line:90%
that the mind will be obedient.

00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:18.818 align:middle line:84%
It will no longer think it's the
voice of reason that tells you

00:25:18.818 --> 00:25:20.486 align:middle line:84%
to get up in the morning that
you should should should.

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:21.454 align:middle line:90%
You're not good enough.

00:25:21.454 --> 00:25:23.589 align:middle line:84%
Instead it will say,
no, we're okay.

00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:25.257 align:middle line:90%
We'll have this very kind voice.

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:27.259 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be cool.

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:28.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And
it's up to us, I guess,

00:25:28.427 --> 00:25:31.831 align:middle line:84%
is there some things
that you also recommend

00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:34.467 align:middle line:90%
to earth, fire, water, people?

00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:35.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
So good, yes.

00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:37.069 align:middle line:90%
So for -- it's a great question.

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:39.872 align:middle line:84%
So for water people it's
being able to do meditation

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.307 align:middle line:90%
and put on soft music.

00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:43.342 align:middle line:84%
There's some great
mantras out there.

00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
To do their yoga.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.312 align:middle line:84%
To learn how to find
peace in the quite?

00:25:46.312 --> 00:25:48.347 align:middle line:84%
And to do it regularly
as a practice.

00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:51.117 align:middle line:84%
For air people they've got to
journal and they have to talk.

00:25:51.117 --> 00:25:52.551 align:middle line:90%
And they have to find places

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.787 align:middle line:84%
where they can learn the
skill in relationship.

00:25:54.787 --> 00:25:56.188 align:middle line:84%
They do not keep
their mouths shut.

00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:57.823 align:middle line:84%
Because air people
can stop talking.

00:25:57.823 --> 00:25:59.058 align:middle line:84%
They get to a certain
point where they feel

00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
like no ones really
listening and they hold back.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.461 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to journal

00:26:02.461 --> 00:26:03.963 align:middle line:90%
to keep talking to writing.

00:26:03.963 --> 00:26:05.531 align:middle line:84%
For earth people
it's very important

00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:06.532 align:middle line:90%
to take care of the land.

00:26:06.532 --> 00:26:08.134 align:middle line:90%
And to take care of the food.

00:26:08.134 --> 00:26:09.802 align:middle line:84%
And to teach us about
organic food.

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.637 align:middle line:84%
And to teach us about
how to eat properly.

00:26:11.637 --> 00:26:13.372 align:middle line:84%
And how to take care
of our money.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And how to share the money.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.776 align:middle line:84%
How not to get so into,
you know, hoarding

00:26:16.776 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:90%
but actually contributing.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.246 align:middle line:84%
So that's a practice
for an earth person.

00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Where am I giving?

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.515 align:middle line:90%
Who do I share with?

00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:24.116 align:middle line:90%
Have I cleaned my closets?

00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:25.685 align:middle line:90%
Have I taken care of the car?

00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:27.887 align:middle line:84%
Those practical things
are done with beauty

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:29.155 align:middle line:90%
and then you're giving.

00:26:29.155 --> 00:26:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And the fire people
it's physical.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.025 align:middle line:84%
Like you really need to move
energy through your body.

00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:34.293 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice.

00:26:34.293 --> 00:26:37.296 align:middle line:84%
If a fire person is not
excited, they're not laughing,

00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:38.664 align:middle line:90%
they're not having a party,

00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:40.966 align:middle line:84%
they're not indulging a little
bit then something is wrong

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.435 align:middle line:90%
and their fire goes out.

00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:44.236 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there's very
practical ways

00:26:44.236 --> 00:26:46.005 align:middle line:90%
to keep your element healthy.

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:47.373 align:middle line:90%
And that's part of my work.

00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:48.474 align:middle line:90%
Part of my life's work.

00:26:48.474 --> 00:26:49.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: But is
there some practices

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:52.478 align:middle line:84%
so that we can get some of
-- because it feels like more

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:54.814 align:middle line:84%
and more of this world
is becoming holistic

00:26:54.814 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and we're aware of
everything really.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.288 align:middle line:84%
Is there some ways
to get more fire --

00:27:02.288 --> 00:27:05.324 align:middle line:84%
to get more like air
for a fire person?

00:27:05.324 --> 00:27:06.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Yes.

00:27:06.025 --> 00:27:06.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Or water?

00:27:06.826 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: So good.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.661 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So that's a
great question.

00:27:08.661 --> 00:27:09.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Any more balance?

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:10.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Right.

00:27:10.663 --> 00:27:12.031 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have
water you can't cry.

00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:14.133 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself
emotionally, you know,

00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:17.403 align:middle line:84%
kind of flat lined or depressed
then you're job is to open

00:27:17.403 --> 00:27:18.604 align:middle line:90%
up your emotional body.

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Like I encourage water
people to watch sad films.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.007 align:middle line:90%
Let themselves cry.

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:23.242 align:middle line:90%
Stop the film.

00:27:23.242 --> 00:27:24.076 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath.

00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:25.144 align:middle line:90%
Don't get lost in depression.

00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.846 align:middle line:90%
Know how to moderate.

00:27:26.846 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a knob for people

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:29.815 align:middle line:90%
that suffer from depression.

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:31.217 align:middle line:90%
They get so indulgent.

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:32.618 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I'm
working with a client

00:27:32.618 --> 00:27:35.554 align:middle line:84%
and I say do you cry easily and
if they say yes I'll say good.

00:27:35.554 --> 00:27:36.555 align:middle line:90%
You cry during this session,

00:27:36.555 --> 00:27:37.757 align:middle line:84%
they always cry during
the session.

00:27:37.757 --> 00:27:38.858 align:middle line:90%
But keep talking.

00:27:38.858 --> 00:27:40.593 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
get lost in your tears.

00:27:40.593 --> 00:27:43.295 align:middle line:84%
If someone says no in a session
I'll say to them I'm going

00:27:43.295 --> 00:27:45.564 align:middle line:84%
to help you touch those feelings
because you've gotten turned

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:47.299 align:middle line:90%
into ice, water has gotten numb.

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:50.069 align:middle line:84%
And I will help them
cultivate the missing element.

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:52.671 align:middle line:84%
If it's air and they've stopped
talking the magical formula

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:55.341 align:middle line:84%
for air people is
to ask questions.

00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:56.909 align:middle line:84%
Learn to sit in front
of someone --

00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:84%
because air people
don't like to talk --

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:59.879 align:middle line:90%
when they're missing air they go

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to a party they don't
want to talk at all.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.715 align:middle line:90%
Can we go home now?

00:28:02.715 --> 00:28:03.649 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:90%
People bug me.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.719 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
cultivate air you say,

00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:07.887 align:middle line:90%
tell me about your childhood.

00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:09.188 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you
ask a question.

00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:11.557 align:middle line:84%
I was telling this to my son
when he was young, I said,

00:28:11.557 --> 00:28:12.825 align:middle line:90%
here's how you get a girl.

00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:14.226 align:middle line:84%
Just asked questions
and they'll answer.

00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:16.228 align:middle line:84%
And then he came home one day
and he said, mom, it's working.

00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:17.997 align:middle line:90%
But they never ask me anything.

00:28:17.997 --> 00:28:20.032 align:middle line:84%
Because people tend to talk
once you give them a chance

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to talk they forget.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.669 align:middle line:84%
So one of the short ways
to get a conversation going

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:26.639 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have air is
simply to ask genuine questions

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:28.374 align:middle line:84%
and then be prepared
for people to talk.

00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:30.876 align:middle line:84%
But that's a great medicine
for air if you're missing it.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:32.978 align:middle line:84%
And if you're missing
earth then go clean.

00:28:32.978 --> 00:28:35.381 align:middle line:84%
Then make it a spirit -- and
I tell clients you're going

00:28:35.381 --> 00:28:37.316 align:middle line:84%
to go -- I'm not going to see
you again until you go home

00:28:37.316 --> 00:28:39.151 align:middle line:90%
and clean up your closet.

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:41.187 align:middle line:84%
Because while all that
clutter is in your world

00:28:41.187 --> 00:28:42.855 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have earth
and you're not taking care

00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:45.191 align:middle line:84%
of the practical world
it's going to interfere

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:47.893 align:middle line:84%
with your manifestation,
with money, with success

00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:49.562 align:middle line:90%
because you've got clutter.

00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:51.063 align:middle line:90%
So that's an earth exercise.

00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.331 align:middle line:90%
Take care of your food.

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:54.667 align:middle line:84%
Take care of your closets
and your practical world.

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:58.537 align:middle line:84%
And fire people I say listen,
you guys have got to exercise.

00:28:58.537 --> 00:29:01.106 align:middle line:84%
Fire is the only element
that it gets energy

00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.241 align:middle line:90%
from spending energy.

00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Fire people get board
and they get depressed

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.511 align:middle line:90%
when they don't move energy.

00:29:05.511 --> 00:29:07.346 align:middle line:84%
But when they move energy
they get more energy.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:08.414 align:middle line:90%
They don't get tired.

00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:09.715 align:middle line:84%
They get more energy
from moving energy.

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.116 align:middle line:84%
It's the opposite
of the rest of us.

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
So if they're not
moving then they're going

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:14.153 align:middle line:90%
to find themselves depressed

00:29:14.153 --> 00:29:15.988 align:middle line:84%
and when fire people get
depressed they get fat.

00:29:15.988 --> 00:29:17.356 align:middle line:90%
And they indulge.

00:29:17.356 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:90%
And they drink to much.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:19.792 align:middle line:90%
And they become addicts.

00:29:19.792 --> 00:29:22.094 align:middle line:84%
Because they just just want to
have a party all by themselves.

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:23.529 align:middle line:84%
They'll do a party
but no one is there.

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:26.232 align:middle line:84%
So they have to learn moderation
with fire that's a big exercise

00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:29.835 align:middle line:84%
and probably the physical
exercise of pushing energy

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:32.137 align:middle line:84%
out will really help get
them from being stuck.

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:35.741 align:middle line:84%
So yes in my life's work what
I do with people in all the,

00:29:35.741 --> 00:29:37.743 align:middle line:84%
you know, I work as
a psychotherapist.

00:29:37.743 --> 00:29:39.645 align:middle line:90%
So people come to see me.

00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:41.213 align:middle line:90%
And I have their chart.

00:29:41.213 --> 00:29:43.148 align:middle line:84%
And I figure out
what's the constitution.

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:45.784 align:middle line:84%
Like what's your
natural beingness.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.152 align:middle line:90%
And then if I see you blocked --

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:49.722 align:middle line:84%
if I see somewhere you're not
being yourself then I just

00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:51.557 align:middle line:84%
as you questioned me I
give them the solution,

00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:52.825 align:middle line:90%
like here's your homework.

00:29:52.825 --> 00:29:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I won't work with
them if they don't do it.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.296 align:middle line:84%
Because I am really interested
in changing peoples lives

00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:58.497 align:middle line:90%
and not just talking about it.

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:00.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: But the
thing that I get from you

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:02.768 align:middle line:84%
and something that I
feel we should already --

00:30:02.768 --> 00:30:06.639 align:middle line:84%
when we stand in our own power
and we're being who we're meant

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:09.909 align:middle line:84%
to be there is a certain
then level of people

00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:14.179 align:middle line:84%
or I guess you attract also a
certain quality or some people

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:16.348 align:middle line:84%
that because this is
what you're committed to

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:18.484 align:middle line:84%
and you have set a
certain standard.

00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:19.685 align:middle line:90%
If I should --

00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:21.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: It's true.

00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:22.922 align:middle line:84%
Just like you are drawing these
fascinating people to interview

00:30:22.922 --> 00:30:25.891 align:middle line:84%
because of the level of
your intense joy and passion

00:30:25.891 --> 00:30:27.459 align:middle line:90%
for what you do, you draw people

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:84%
who are joyfully
passionately doing what they do.

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:30.496 align:middle line:90%
We like vibration.

00:30:30.496 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:33.966 align:middle line:84%
You know, I get fed up
with all the spiritual --

00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:35.334 align:middle line:90%
I call it spiritual/smearitual.

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:36.902 align:middle line:90%
Like you are what you eat.

00:30:36.902 --> 00:30:39.271 align:middle line:84%
No. How about you
create your own reality.

00:30:39.271 --> 00:30:40.306 align:middle line:90%
Think positive.

00:30:40.306 --> 00:30:42.174 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, you know,
let's be real.

00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:45.711 align:middle line:84%
So there's a definite truth
to you -- this one's true.

00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:47.012 align:middle line:90%
What you vibrationally put

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
out in the world will
come back to you.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.682 align:middle line:84%
That's not a
spiritual/smearitual,

00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:50.816 align:middle line:90%
that's a fact.

00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:53.953 align:middle line:84%
So keep your energy in
a focused way genuine

00:30:53.953 --> 00:30:57.022 align:middle line:84%
and find your passion and
then your find those people.

00:30:57.022 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:90%
I draw them like candy.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.225 align:middle line:84%
I find the coolest --
I say I have a magnet

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.027 align:middle line:84%
in my belly button
that's my big joke.

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:03.529 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have a
magnet in my belly button

00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
but I draw the coolest people

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.633 align:middle line:84%
because vibrationally
that's what I'm looking for.

00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:09.101 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm radiating.

00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere I go it's
just a chance for me to see

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.975 align:middle line:84%
who can I find that's a little
bit sleepy that I can go, hello.

00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:18.944 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as they wake up
they go I'm so glad you're here.

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:21.513 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
lonely the quickest way

00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:24.516 align:middle line:90%
out of loneliness is go give.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:27.219 align:middle line:84%
Go find someone that
you know is lonely.

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:90%
If we only weren't scared

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.656 align:middle line:84%
or been embarrassed
by our humanness.

00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:31.724 align:middle line:90%
That's one of my gifts.

00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:34.426 align:middle line:84%
Is I am so honest
about how funny I am.

00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Or quirky.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.628 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever.

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:39.264 align:middle line:84%
I've got all these, I'm a small
personality if you noticed.

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.733 align:middle line:90%
Joke. That was a joke.

00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:42.201 align:middle line:90%
I've got this big personality

00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:44.837 align:middle line:84%
and as a result I draw
people to feel safe with me.

00:31:44.837 --> 00:31:48.407 align:middle line:84%
Because the secret
is to not judge.

00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:52.378 align:middle line:84%
Like the quirkier you are --
even the people I don't like,

00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:54.847 align:middle line:84%
part of me wants to go
sneak in and go really?

00:31:54.847 --> 00:31:56.448 align:middle line:84%
Like, tell me how
you're thinking.

00:31:56.448 --> 00:32:00.652 align:middle line:84%
And that genuine interest puts
me into the voice of compassion.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:03.022 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know
I'm drawing the coolest people

00:32:03.022 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:90%
because of the compassion.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.525 align:middle line:90%
That's really the big magnet.

00:32:06.525 --> 00:32:08.093 align:middle line:90%
Can you love?

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:09.795 align:middle line:84%
Who are you in love
with in your life?

00:32:09.795 --> 00:32:12.431 align:middle line:84%
It could be a dog, it
could be your partner,

00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.799 align:middle line:84%
it could be your
grandma who died.

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter but you've
got to think of someone

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.737 align:middle line:84%
who made your heart go -- and
as soon as you're in that space

00:32:18.737 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of genuine enthusiasm
for this place that's

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.008 align:middle line:90%
when the magic begins.

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:25.711 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically when I
feel like I'm a fire starter.

00:32:25.711 --> 00:32:27.413 align:middle line:84%
Like I have a lot
of fire in my chart.

00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:28.847 align:middle line:90%
You probably can't notice.

00:32:28.847 --> 00:32:30.849 align:middle line:84%
And I start the fire and
I put it under their chair

00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:32.951 align:middle line:90%
and I go, now, come on.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.019 align:middle line:90%
And they go what?

00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:37.523 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm trying
to say to them you --

00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:38.757 align:middle line:90%
this is only one life.

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:40.592 align:middle line:84%
I don't know -- I do believe
in past lives personally

00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:42.528 align:middle line:84%
but you can't really
prove any of that.

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:46.031 align:middle line:84%
What we do know is
this is a short movie.

00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
And we're at 2012.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.635 align:middle line:90%
And it's a full moon today.

00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:51.336 align:middle line:84%
It will be a fool
moon next month.

00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:53.338 align:middle line:84%
It will be a fool moon
every time the sky reaches

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:56.809 align:middle line:84%
that peak experience where
the energies are all rising up

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:57.876 align:middle line:90%
and the water is rising.

00:32:57.876 --> 00:33:00.446 align:middle line:90%
We to -- are we sleepy?

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:04.583 align:middle line:84%
Did we forget the
privilege of being here?

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:07.419 align:middle line:90%
Like this is a breath of life.

00:33:07.419 --> 00:33:09.421 align:middle line:84%
And in the process
of being alive

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:11.323 align:middle line:84%
in a lifetime you
have the opportunity

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:13.492 align:middle line:90%
to see who you can touch.

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:17.196 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to be in
a big giant glamorous way.

00:33:17.196 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:90%
It can just be as simple

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.567 align:middle line:84%
as you made your cat
feel so good today.

00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:23.769 align:middle line:84%
Or you made the person
sitting next to you go I was

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.204 align:middle line:90%
so glad you were here.

00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:25.971 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:26.939 align:middle line:90%
I feel so much better.

00:33:26.939 --> 00:33:29.108 align:middle line:84%
That's my invitation
to everyone.

00:33:29.108 --> 00:33:33.045 align:middle line:84%
Can people walk away having
seen you and said, wow,

00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:34.947 align:middle line:84%
that was such a great
conversation.

00:33:34.947 --> 00:33:36.215 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
when I met Sting.

00:33:36.215 --> 00:33:37.816 align:middle line:84%
When we finished the
session at the end he said

00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:39.685 align:middle line:84%
to me I haven't had one
of these conversations.

00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:41.954 align:middle line:84%
When you finish talking
to someone and you go

00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:43.655 align:middle line:84%
like you're such
a good listener.

00:33:43.655 --> 00:33:45.157 align:middle line:90%
That's the other art.

00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:49.895 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know how to bless
for all four elements, listen.

00:33:49.895 --> 00:33:51.964 align:middle line:84%
Stop the noises inside
your head.

00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:53.565 align:middle line:90%
We're back to the mind.

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:56.101 align:middle line:84%
And actually hear
the person talking.

00:33:56.101 --> 00:33:57.936 align:middle line:90%
And let your heart open.

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:02.474 align:middle line:84%
And feel your body
tingle and hear the birds.

00:34:02.474 --> 00:34:05.944 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden you're in
the present moment going, wow.

00:34:05.944 --> 00:34:07.312 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:34:07.312 --> 00:34:11.083 align:middle line:84%
And I've only got so much time
before this movie is over.

00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:11.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Because
in the case

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:90%
of Sting what was there for him?

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.287 align:middle line:90%
Why? What was he --

00:34:15.287 --> 00:34:17.322 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Sivlerman: I think
we just genuinely had a

00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:18.189 align:middle line:90%
soul connection.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:18.824 align:middle line:90%
I mean we do.

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:20.092 align:middle line:90%
We are friends.

00:34:20.092 --> 00:34:24.496 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're with
someone and you aren't wowed by,

00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:27.932 align:middle line:84%
their not pretty or they're so
pretty or they're so successful

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:29.301 align:middle line:84%
and they're some --
and you're just simply

00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:32.104 align:middle line:84%
with someone I find the
funniest people tickle me.

00:34:32.104 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:90%
Like, it doesn't require fame.

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:35.374 align:middle line:90%
But in that case when Sting

00:34:35.374 --> 00:34:38.677 align:middle line:84%
and I met we genuinely
had a friendship.

00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:39.912 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:43.548 align:middle line:84%
And because I was guileless
or I was was without ego

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.249 align:middle line:84%
in my genuine appreciation
of him

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:47.853 align:middle line:90%
and so was he we became friends.

00:34:47.853 --> 00:34:50.155 align:middle line:84%
The fact that he's
Sting is a small detail.

00:34:50.155 --> 00:34:53.892 align:middle line:84%
I've always impressed that the
American culture is so captured.

00:34:53.892 --> 00:34:57.162 align:middle line:84%
I find this -- I would love to
do a whole psychological study

00:34:57.162 --> 00:34:59.698 align:middle line:90%
on what is celebritism.

00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:02.868 align:middle line:84%
What part of us super
imposes ideals

00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:90%
on another and makes them grand.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.104 align:middle line:90%
I do it to my best friends.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.574 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone of my best
friends are a rock star.

00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:09.474 align:middle line:90%
My friend you met today.

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.076 align:middle line:90%
I think she is a rock star.

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:13.145 align:middle line:84%
I do. And so I treat
her like rock star.

00:35:13.145 --> 00:35:14.746 align:middle line:90%
And I can't wait to be with her.

00:35:14.746 --> 00:35:16.515 align:middle line:90%
And I listen to what she says.

00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:18.517 align:middle line:90%
And I'm captured by her beauty.

00:35:18.517 --> 00:35:20.118 align:middle line:84%
As I am her four-year-old
daughter

00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:21.553 align:middle line:90%
who I can't wait to see.

00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:25.724 align:middle line:84%
So it's the enthusiasm of
the privilege of being alive

00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:84%
in this time when we are
at this critical junction

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.463 align:middle line:84%
to see can this lifetime,
can the experience

00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:34.867 align:middle line:84%
of being human be lifted
up to a higher frequency

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:39.204 align:middle line:84%
where we're actually conscious
enough to choose to be alive,

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:42.808 align:middle line:84%
to choose to honor this temple
called the body, to take respect

00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:44.676 align:middle line:84%
for this emotional
body that's so tender

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:47.779 align:middle line:84%
and not be rejecting my
sadness but actually embrace it.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:50.749 align:middle line:84%
To honor the fact that I have
sexual energy and I'm alive

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:53.352 align:middle line:84%
and I've got chi and
I'm not afraid of it.

00:35:53.352 --> 00:35:55.287 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be crazy
if -- and money.

00:35:55.287 --> 00:35:57.122 align:middle line:84%
That I could take my money
and know how to share it

00:35:57.122 --> 00:36:01.526 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't so -- this
is the future coming soon

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:02.628 align:middle line:90%
to our neighborhood.

00:36:02.628 --> 00:36:03.896 align:middle line:90%
We're turning the corner.

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:04.963 align:middle line:90%
We're about there.

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:07.099 align:middle line:84%
We're at this very
unusual critical moment

00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:09.167 align:middle line:84%
where we're going do you
think we're going to make it?

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:11.003 align:middle line:84%
I hear this all the
time in my own heart.

00:36:11.003 --> 00:36:14.206 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's just me but
it seems to me that there's an

00:36:14.206 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
under current of dissatisfaction
and disappointment.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.879 align:middle line:84%
And at the top level of that
just like there would be

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:22.547 align:middle line:84%
if you were in a room
hearing a woman give birth.

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:25.851 align:middle line:84%
You're like this is wrong
but on the flip side

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:29.288 align:middle line:84%
of that there is this possible
miracle where we turn a corner

00:36:29.288 --> 00:36:32.224 align:middle line:84%
and we suddenly realize
the old ways of us being

00:36:32.224 --> 00:36:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing how to stay
awake in the middle of the movie

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.497 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing how to be in
the kindness that's so old.

00:36:38.497 --> 00:36:40.098 align:middle line:84%
One day our kids are
going to say to us,

00:36:40.098 --> 00:36:42.434 align:middle line:84%
our great great great
grandkids that are coming up,

00:36:42.434 --> 00:36:44.636 align:middle line:84%
they're going to say there
was a time in history

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:48.006 align:middle line:84%
when other parents used
to fight with guns.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:49.675 align:middle line:90%
And they would hurt each other.

00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't even know why.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.612 align:middle line:84%
They would just take
these things called war

00:36:53.612 --> 00:36:56.615 align:middle line:84%
and they'll go, wow, can you
imagine how uncomfortable

00:36:56.615 --> 00:36:57.749 align:middle line:90%
that was?

00:36:57.749 --> 00:37:01.653 align:middle line:90%
And now we know how to coexist.

00:37:01.653 --> 00:37:03.422 align:middle line:90%
Coming soon.

00:37:03.422 --> 00:37:04.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what you feel here.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:05.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yes.

00:37:05.857 --> 00:37:06.825 align:middle line:84%
That's what we feel
here definitely.

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:08.193 align:middle line:84%
We're more into the
present moment

00:37:08.193 --> 00:37:10.796 align:middle line:84%
because those elements are so
vivid and sometimes in towns

00:37:10.796 --> 00:37:14.132 align:middle line:84%
and cities and when we have our
day jobs it's a bit more rough

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and I know a lot of
teachers say, well,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.538 align:middle line:90%
we can find this every where.

00:37:19.538 --> 00:37:22.941 align:middle line:84%
But it's true some places are
more beautiful than others.

00:37:22.941 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And it brings us
directly in that moment.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: And that
cease why people like Rom Doss

00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:29.247 align:middle line:84%
or Eckhart Tolle or
all the great teachers,

00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:30.615 align:middle line:90%
why we sit with them.

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly we realize
when we're in their presence.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.787 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, just simple
presence is enough.

00:37:35.787 --> 00:37:38.056 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you -- that's
why we watch these videos.

00:37:38.056 --> 00:37:39.358 align:middle line:90%
That's why we turn on the radio.

00:37:39.358 --> 00:37:40.759 align:middle line:90%
It's so poplar.

00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:44.363 align:middle line:84%
These books are so like addicted
to remind us with all the chaos

00:37:44.363 --> 00:37:47.299 align:middle line:84%
that there's this inner
world called the soul

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:48.667 align:middle line:90%
where it's just a breath.

00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:51.536 align:middle line:90%
And it's so simple.

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:54.706 align:middle line:84%
And it's as simple as being able
to realize that your bedroom

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:56.708 align:middle line:84%
and your sheets and your
pillow and that hot shower

00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.643 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and that
yummy toast that smells

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:03.248 align:middle line:84%
so good is absolutely
your doorway to gratitude.

00:38:03.248 --> 00:38:04.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: To
the present moment.

00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:06.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: And that's
really my deepest calling.

00:38:06.218 --> 00:38:08.153 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not so good
at it, just so you know,

00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:09.321 align:middle line:90%
to be perfectly honest.

00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.355 align:middle line:90%
I am getting older --

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:11.857 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: I saw
you on the beach.

00:38:11.857 --> 00:38:12.991 align:middle line:90%
You are so good at it.

00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:13.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Yeah.

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:14.793 align:middle line:90%
Well, because I've learned --

00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:15.727 align:middle line:84%
I've learned as I've
gotten older --

00:38:15.727 --> 00:38:16.762 align:middle line:84%
this is the gift
of turning older.

00:38:16.762 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle line:90%
Everyone needs to know this.

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:18.797 align:middle line:90%
I saw this on Facebook.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.165 align:middle line:84%
Someone said what will
you tell your kids

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.266 align:middle line:90%
if you could as an adult.

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:23.969 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say the older
you get the better.

00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:26.004 align:middle line:90%
Like I am now my mid 50s

00:38:26.004 --> 00:38:28.974 align:middle line:84%
and what I know is
I really appreciate

00:38:28.974 --> 00:38:30.842 align:middle line:90%
that salt water in my mouth.

00:38:30.842 --> 00:38:32.778 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
when the sun comes up

00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:34.346 align:middle line:90%
and I see the sky change colors.

00:38:34.346 --> 00:38:36.948 align:middle line:84%
Like, it used to be
-- you're so busy.

00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you're
in your 20s and you're trying

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.786 align:middle line:84%
so hard and you're
running around

00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:43.455 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you get older
and you go let's slow down.

00:38:43.455 --> 00:38:44.389 align:middle line:90%
The turtle.

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:45.891 align:middle line:84%
My gift that gave
me this turtle.

00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I was swimming in the ocean
-- this is a crazy story.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.562 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't stand up and I
was holding on to the rocks.

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:52.564 align:middle line:84%
And I held on to this rock,
I thought it was a rock,

00:38:52.564 --> 00:38:53.899 align:middle line:90%
and then his little hand hit me?

00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: No.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: And
I started screaming.

00:38:55.834 --> 00:38:57.102 align:middle line:90%
And it was a turtle this big.

00:38:57.102 --> 00:38:59.704 align:middle line:84%
And I got out of the ocean
I went, I got the message.

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.739 align:middle line:90%
Slow down Deb.

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:03.875 align:middle line:90%
I was touched by a turtle.

00:39:03.875 --> 00:39:05.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Very cool.

00:39:05.277 --> 00:39:06.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman: And it's the
elemental magic of the turtle --

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:08.079 align:middle line:90%
America was named

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.815 align:middle line:84%
by the American Indians
as turtle island.

00:39:09.815 --> 00:39:13.385 align:middle line:84%
And the gift of that is they
lived, the American Indians

00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:16.354 align:middle line:84%
on the soil with the elements
and the four directions

00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.223 align:middle line:84%
as the centerpiece
of their universe.

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:20.225 align:middle line:84%
And the decisions were
made by the tribe.

00:39:20.225 --> 00:39:22.227 align:middle line:84%
And we knew how to
listen to each other.

00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:23.328 align:middle line:90%
And we ate together.

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was a completely
different world.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.498 align:middle line:90%
Back to turtle.

00:39:26.498 --> 00:39:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Back
to turtle world.

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:29.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
I was so gifted

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:31.236 align:middle line:90%
to be able to touch that turtle.

00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.704 align:middle line:90%
And I continue to carry that.

00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:35.507 align:middle line:84%
So my prayer for all of us in
the name of the elements is

00:39:35.507 --> 00:39:38.276 align:middle line:84%
to let the water, the
stillness of the water

00:39:38.276 --> 00:39:39.478 align:middle line:90%
to know how to start the day.

00:39:39.478 --> 00:39:41.346 align:middle line:90%
Listen how we start our day.

00:39:41.346 --> 00:39:43.014 align:middle line:90%
You walk into the bathroom.

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:43.815 align:middle line:90%
You brush your teeth.

00:39:43.815 --> 00:39:44.449 align:middle line:90%
You go to the bathroom.

00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:45.584 align:middle line:90%
You take a shower.

00:39:45.584 --> 00:39:47.452 align:middle line:84%
The first thing everyone
does is water as soon

00:39:47.452 --> 00:39:49.221 align:middle line:84%
as we enter the first
part of the day.

00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:50.755 align:middle line:84%
Then we go on the computers
and go what's my day

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:84%
about again I can't remember,
where's my day timer.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.659 align:middle line:84%
Air. We get telephone, we
get the computer going.

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:56.061 align:middle line:90%
And we start thinking.

00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:57.963 align:middle line:84%
Then we get to the earth part
of the day, what's my job again?

00:39:57.963 --> 00:39:59.231 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, I got an
interview to do.

00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:00.565 align:middle line:84%
I've got to check
things off my list.

00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got to make sure I've
got all my money, all my lines

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.735 align:middle line:90%
in order, all my little things.

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:05.103 align:middle line:84%
And then we get to the
fire part of the day.

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:07.739 align:middle line:84%
We get to have some fire water,
wine, at the end of the day.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.841 align:middle line:84%
We celebrate sitting around
the table, around the fire,

00:40:09.841 --> 00:40:11.376 align:middle line:90%
and we share our stories and go,

00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.144 align:middle line:84%
you won't believe
what happened to me.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.346 align:middle line:90%
That's the fire.

00:40:14.346 --> 00:40:16.915 align:middle line:84%
So there's a natural
rhythm to the four elements.

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.216 align:middle line:90%
It happens every where.

00:40:18.216 --> 00:40:20.685 align:middle line:90%
Nine months in a womb, water.

00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:23.088 align:middle line:90%
First breath, air.

00:40:23.088 --> 00:40:25.323 align:middle line:84%
Then the next 18 years
earth, we put them in school

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:26.525 align:middle line:90%
and teach them how

00:40:26.525 --> 00:40:28.326 align:middle line:84%
to do whatever we teach
them in that earth cycle.

00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:84%
And then fire cycle, we
get to the second, third,

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:32.797 align:middle line:84%
fourth part of our life, the
end, and we get to go celebrate

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and we have fire cycles
as elders where we travel

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.103 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy ourselves and we
feel like we can retire.

00:40:38.103 --> 00:40:39.771 align:middle line:84%
So they go in cycles,
the four elements.

00:40:39.771 --> 00:40:41.907 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere you look.

00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:43.675 align:middle line:90%
But we forgot.

00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:46.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Was I being
present to those and learning

00:40:46.378 --> 00:40:49.881 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate them then the more
we enrich our experience too.

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:50.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Exactly.

00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:51.983 align:middle line:84%
Like look at our day
we spent the morning

00:40:51.983 --> 00:40:53.518 align:middle line:90%
at the beach in water.

00:40:53.518 --> 00:40:55.654 align:middle line:84%
Then we did the air, we
sat together and talked

00:40:55.654 --> 00:40:56.988 align:middle line:90%
and we got to know each other.

00:40:56.988 --> 00:40:59.257 align:middle line:84%
Now we're doing earth here
we are doing the practicality

00:40:59.257 --> 00:41:01.293 align:middle line:84%
of this wonderful
interview sharing.

00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:03.428 align:middle line:84%
And then the fire cycle is
we're going to say that was

00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:04.829 align:middle line:90%
so fun I'm so thankful.

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:05.363 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:05.363 --> 00:41:06.298 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:06.298 --> 00:41:07.065 align:middle line:84%
And all jacked up
and all excited

00:41:07.065 --> 00:41:08.033 align:middle line:90%
because look what we did.

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:10.168 align:middle line:84%
So everything follows
the cycles.

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:12.737 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately it's an
old ancient system that we've

00:41:12.737 --> 00:41:16.875 align:middle line:84%
over rid with other business
and our lack of awareness.

00:41:16.875 --> 00:41:19.311 align:middle line:84%
So the awareness is simply
asking yourself what element

00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:20.445 align:middle line:90%
am I?

00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:22.948 align:middle line:84%
Like you clearly carry
fire and you have water.

00:41:22.948 --> 00:41:24.849 align:middle line:90%
You've got a strong personality.

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.051 align:middle line:90%
But you've got a deep rich --

00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:27.018 align:middle line:84%
and you can see it
in your chart.

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:27.852 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you later.

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:29.087 align:middle line:90%
You've got lots of water.

00:41:29.087 --> 00:41:30.522 align:middle line:90%
I am clearly air.

00:41:30.522 --> 00:41:31.656 align:middle line:90%
I can talk.

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.725 align:middle line:84%
And I've got this fire
that gets all excited.

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:36.261 align:middle line:84%
And in my healing work when
I'm with people I go very deep

00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:37.629 align:middle line:90%
into water, believe it or not.

00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:39.297 align:middle line:90%
I can learn to not talk.

00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:40.865 align:middle line:84%
I did learn this through
the four elements.

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.667 align:middle line:90%
The value of silence.

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:45.103 align:middle line:84%
So we learn which one
is which, whose who.

00:41:45.103 --> 00:41:47.138 align:middle line:84%
How do I make you
comfortable in your skin

00:41:47.138 --> 00:41:49.107 align:middle line:84%
as an astrologer
as the therapist.

00:41:49.107 --> 00:41:52.911 align:middle line:84%
How do I give you permission to
be Lilou and be your total self.

00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:56.381 align:middle line:84%
And you leave going I feel so
much more myself, thank you.

00:41:56.381 --> 00:41:58.583 align:middle line:84%
And then how do I support you
in going out into the world

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:01.152 align:middle line:84%
and saying, now you
go and contribute this

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:04.923 align:middle line:84%
because the people are
starving for real people

00:42:04.923 --> 00:42:06.758 align:middle line:90%
who really can touch our hearts.

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Like you did to the woman that
you invited into your home.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:10.996 align:middle line:84%
If more people would
just say yes to everyone,

00:42:10.996 --> 00:42:11.896 align:middle line:90%
come over to my house.

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:12.964 align:middle line:90%
Let's be kind.

00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:13.965 align:middle line:90%
Let's share.

00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:15.133 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't this be a
different planet.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:17.936 align:middle line:84%
If we just assumed
we could trust

00:42:17.936 --> 00:42:20.438 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't have
to lock the doors.

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Well,
then we're going

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:23.875 align:middle line:84%
into a whole other conversation
and it's called intuition.

00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:24.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Yes.

00:42:24.576 --> 00:42:25.143 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you have it.

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:26.111 align:middle line:90%
That's water.

00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:26.811 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:28.046 align:middle line:90%
So water is intuition.

00:42:28.046 --> 00:42:30.982 align:middle line:84%
Those people that have deep
sensing and feel people.

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:32.217 align:middle line:90%
That's the water element.

00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:34.119 align:middle line:84%
Air people are the ones that
really ask the questions

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:35.820 align:middle line:90%
and get all the stories out.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.589 align:middle line:90%
And they collect information.

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And earth people are the ones

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.392 align:middle line:84%
that is really know
how to get things done.

00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:44.262 align:middle line:84%
Boy can they manifest and
are they good at details.

00:42:44.262 --> 00:42:47.565 align:middle line:84%
You can count on them to be on
time they are always reliable.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.435 align:middle line:84%
And those fire people,
their function is

00:42:50.435 --> 00:42:52.871 align:middle line:84%
to get us all excited and say
what are we doing tonight.

00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:54.239 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go to a concert.

00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:54.939 align:middle line:90%
Can we go play?

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:55.974 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a holiday.

00:42:55.974 --> 00:42:56.975 align:middle line:90%
Let's think about a vacation.

00:42:56.975 --> 00:42:58.243 align:middle line:90%
Let's have sex.

00:42:58.243 --> 00:43:00.412 align:middle line:84%
They get us all jacked
up and excited.

00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:04.649 align:middle line:84%
So this is the function and yes
if the world were clean water

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:07.852 align:middle line:84%
and knew how to trust their
intuition, if it was fresh air

00:43:07.852 --> 00:43:10.455 align:middle line:84%
and we could talk to
each other, kindly.

00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:12.357 align:middle line:84%
And knew how to actually tell
the truth to your partner

00:43:12.357 --> 00:43:14.559 align:middle line:84%
who was bugging you with the
way that they want to hear it.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.961 align:middle line:90%
And we knew how to share, earth.

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.063 align:middle line:90%
And we knew how fire.

00:43:18.063 --> 00:43:20.198 align:middle line:84%
You see fire is also
arguing and fighting.

00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:23.702 align:middle line:84%
We're so awkward when
it comes to disagreeing.

00:43:23.702 --> 00:43:25.970 align:middle line:84%
We are so mean when
it comes to being able

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.474 align:middle line:84%
to just tell the truth and say
you're allowed to be angry.

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:31.142 align:middle line:90%
You're allowed to get feisty.

00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:32.977 align:middle line:90%
But do it with your heart open.

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:34.446 align:middle line:90%
Don't scream and yell at me.

00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Just say you're angry.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.083 align:middle line:84%
So there's art to all
of these four elements.

00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:39.584 align:middle line:84%
And that's very much
what I teach

00:43:39.584 --> 00:43:40.618 align:middle line:90%
in the workshops that I do.

00:43:40.618 --> 00:43:42.921 align:middle line:90%
How do we master water?

00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:45.423 align:middle line:90%
How do we learn about stillness?

00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:47.559 align:middle line:84%
How do we talk with
words that are poetry

00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:48.960 align:middle line:90%
so you want to hear them.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So when the person finishes
telling you the story you go I

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:90%
learned something.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.765 align:middle line:90%
I remembered it.

00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:58.203 align:middle line:84%
And how do we actually,
like, enjoy the food?

00:43:58.203 --> 00:43:59.704 align:middle line:90%
That's like one of my favorites.

00:43:59.704 --> 00:44:01.773 align:middle line:84%
The earth, the feet
on the ground.

00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:04.976 align:middle line:84%
And how do we -- you know,
the art of making love.

00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:07.912 align:middle line:84%
Of knowing how to
actually be impassioned.

00:44:07.912 --> 00:44:09.948 align:middle line:90%
Knowing how to fight.

00:44:09.948 --> 00:44:11.816 align:middle line:90%
We're so funny.

00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:14.219 align:middle line:84%
We're just an awkward --
we're an awkward specious.

00:44:14.219 --> 00:44:16.788 align:middle line:84%
And we are turning
a corner into --

00:44:16.788 --> 00:44:19.124 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I had my way I
wish I was on the counsel

00:44:19.124 --> 00:44:20.892 align:middle line:84%
and I could actually
say can I help

00:44:20.892 --> 00:44:22.527 align:middle line:84%
with the human design
just a little bit?

00:44:22.527 --> 00:44:26.030 align:middle line:84%
How about we take out the place
where we hurt people we love.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.565 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take that
off the table.

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:30.435 align:middle line:84%
How about we put instead
that when you're really upset

00:44:30.435 --> 00:44:31.669 align:middle line:90%
with someone you sit in silence.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.639 align:middle line:84%
And you say I just want
to sit here with you.

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:35.774 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about it.

00:44:35.774 --> 00:44:38.376 align:middle line:84%
But I have want to
hold your hand.

00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:41.846 align:middle line:84%
And when we're done in silence
we'll review what just happened.

00:44:41.846 --> 00:44:44.082 align:middle line:84%
But let me start by
telling you I really care.

00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:46.117 align:middle line:84%
And I did whatever
I did by mistake.

00:44:46.117 --> 00:44:48.853 align:middle line:90%
Don't get mad.

00:44:48.853 --> 00:44:51.055 align:middle line:90%
That's the planet I'm from.

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Thank
you so much, Debra.

00:44:52.757 --> 00:44:53.858 align:middle line:90%
This was awesome.

00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.727 align:middle line:84%
This was such a beautiful
conversation.

00:44:55.727 --> 00:44:59.464 align:middle line:84%
What a privilege to have met
you and share this information

00:44:59.464 --> 00:45:02.500 align:middle line:84%
with you, my beautiful
go greeters.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.636 align:middle line:84%
We send you much love
from Kauai, right.

00:45:04.636 --> 00:45:06.004 align:middle line:90%
Lots of air, fire --

00:45:06.004 --> 00:45:07.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Debra Silverman:
Water and earth.

00:45:07.138 --> 00:45:08.540 align:middle line:90%
The aloha spirit.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.009 align:middle line:84%
Let it find its way inside of
your heart as you shut this down

00:45:11.009 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
and go thanks I feel
so much different.

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:16.681 align:middle line:84%
The future is going be a place
where we all remember how

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:20.285 align:middle line:84%
to pray, how to love,
and how to do friendship.

00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:22.787 align:middle line:84%
Coming soon to your
neighborhood.

00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:24.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Namaste.

00:45:24.889 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Debra Silverman: Aloha.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Aloha.
