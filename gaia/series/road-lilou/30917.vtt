>> Jackie Lapin:
There's seven key steps

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to consciously creating
the life that you want.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.256 align:middle line:84%
The first one is to recognize
how powerful that you are.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.392 align:middle line:84%
When you realize
that when you choose

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.395 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate more high
frequencies,

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.965 align:middle line:84%
you actually change the ratio of
experience you have in your life

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.368 align:middle line:84%
from positive experiences
to more

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.804 align:middle line:90%
than less negative experiences.

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:38.305 align:middle line:90%
You shift the more --

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.308 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your life into
a more positive framework.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.612 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that
you have that power

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:48.182 align:middle line:84%
to change your experience,
you're no longer a victim.

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:52.453 align:middle line:84%
That you are the vessel
for changing your life.

00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:54.355 align:middle line:84%
That's a really important
first step.

00:00:54.355 --> 00:01:00.027 align:middle line:84%
The second step is being aware
of your negative energy habits.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:04.564 align:middle line:84%
You know, so often
we are not cognizant

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.933 align:middle line:90%
of the things that we do.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.102 align:middle line:84%
But some of the negative
energy habits included things

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:10.037 align:middle line:90%
like complaining all the time.

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:13.174 align:middle line:84%
Assuming everything is going
to happen for the worst.

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:14.708 align:middle line:90%
Putting ourselves down.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:18.579 align:middle line:84%
Not thinking kindly
about ourselves.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.881 align:middle line:90%
Blaming others.

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Being angry.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Assuming that the world
is out to get you.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.588 align:middle line:90%
When you are -- and I recommend

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.925 align:middle line:84%
that people actually set
their cell phones once an hour

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:33.194 align:middle line:84%
and click on and see
what you're thinking

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.629 align:middle line:84%
when that alarm goes off and
you're going to be surprised

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.232 align:middle line:84%
at how much of this
negative self talk

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:41.669 align:middle line:84%
or negative perspective
of the world.

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.806 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to
recognize your energy habits

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:51.545 align:middle line:84%
and you see them as a pattern,
you have the ability to change.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
So the next step,
the third step,

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.884 align:middle line:84%
is to raise your
personal frequency.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.354 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when you have
this power as we obvious do

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:04.525 align:middle line:84%
to manifest -- when your raise
your personal frequency --

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:84%
and by the way water
is a great way

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.895 align:middle line:84%
to raise your personal
frequency.

00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:10.798 align:middle line:90%
Showers, pools, the ocean.

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:11.732 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Baths.

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin:
Baths, absolutely.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
When you raise your personal
frequency you have a choice.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.708 align:middle line:84%
You can say, okay, you know, I
can just kind of go about my day

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.576 align:middle line:84%
and live with what's
coming at me.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.412 align:middle line:84%
Or you can say, oh, you
know, I can think differently

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.349 align:middle line:84%
about this, or I can
change my perspective.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:90%
Now, and it's really important

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.918 align:middle line:84%
that you're not just
changing your thoughts

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:33.254 align:middle line:84%
but you're changing
your emotions as well.

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:35.823 align:middle line:84%
Because our emotions
are the express mail

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:90%
to the cosmic post office.

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:38.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: A happy face

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:42.229 align:middle line:84%
with not really all the emotions
behind it doesn't do much,

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%
does it?

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.564 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: It doesn't.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:44.331 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.833 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about how

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.435 align:middle line:84%
that limits your
ability as a manifester.

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:84%
But so when you really
understand

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:56.877 align:middle line:84%
that you can change it there
is a real influence you have

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.279 align:middle line:90%
over your life.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.983 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I know now that if
I come into my office with a day

00:03:02.983 --> 00:03:06.754 align:middle line:84%
that I am feeling
miserable and unhappy,

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:10.024 align:middle line:84%
then I guarantee that's the
day that my computer goes out.

00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:12.893 align:middle line:84%
And there's no accident because
our energy effects everything

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:14.161 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle line:84%
And when I relax and take
a breath things loosen up

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.999 align:middle line:90%
and begin to flow again.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.336 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, there
are two experiences,

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.872 align:middle line:84%
one where you actually have
all those negative energy

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.974 align:middle line:90%
experiences, and the second

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:29.109 align:middle line:84%
where you're just
having a bad day.

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.312 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're not a
negative conscious creator,

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:90%
you're just having a bad day.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:37.351 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the dog is having
a problem, your boss, you know,

00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.787 align:middle line:84%
screams at you, or
something goes out of control.

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:41.822 align:middle line:90%
And then it starts to spiral.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.658 align:middle line:84%
You know how it gets worse and
worse and worse all day long.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're
letting your energy spiral.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.497 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if I
don't stop it then,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.100 align:middle line:84%
then my next day is not
going to be any fun.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: That's part
of being conscious, right?

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.937 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that we're
not right now --

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.205 align:middle line:90%
this is not happening to us.

00:03:58.205 --> 00:03:59.306 align:middle line:90%
We're creating that.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.641 align:middle line:90%
You have to stop.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Exactly.

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.478 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. Being aware
that it's us

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:10.617 align:middle line:84%
that is not totally influencing
us but it's a major factor.

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.921 align:middle line:84%
So as you saw all
these beautiful roses,

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.757 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I will do is
I will come out into this yard

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.428 align:middle line:84%
to all these 300 roses and I
will smell the roses, literally,

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
or I will cut them and
bring them into my home.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.567 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many things
that is other people can do

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.602 align:middle line:90%
to shift their energy instantly.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:31.338 align:middle line:90%
They can go out into nature.

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.506 align:middle line:90%
They can exercise.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:35.876 align:middle line:84%
They can play with their
dogs or their kids.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:37.811 align:middle line:84%
They can listen to
music or play music.

00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:39.179 align:middle line:90%
They can meditate.

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:40.881 align:middle line:90%
They can get into a state

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:44.718 align:middle line:84%
where they remember a beautiful
place where they've been.

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.687 align:middle line:90%
Anything that brings you peace

00:04:46.687 --> 00:04:50.157 align:middle line:84%
and joy will shift your
energy instantaneously.

00:04:50.157 --> 00:04:52.259 align:middle line:84%
And you really want to
take advantage of that.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.929 align:middle line:84%
So be cognizant that you can
raise your personal frequency

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.398 align:middle line:90%
and choose to do that.

00:04:57.398 --> 00:04:58.932 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
-- there's a book --

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:02.603 align:middle line:84%
there's a chapter in my book,
Practical Conscious Creation,

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:06.006 align:middle line:84%
that talks about
changing your perspective.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:07.741 align:middle line:90%
So you experience something

00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.344 align:middle line:84%
that you would normally
think is negative

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:13.414 align:middle line:84%
but you can shift how
you view that experience.

00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, here I have 20
individual little questions you

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.951 align:middle line:90%
can ask.

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.087 align:middle line:84%
Such as -- to refrain
the experience.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:24.391 align:middle line:84%
Such as what have I -- what can
I learn from this experience

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:25.826 align:middle line:84%
that will make it
better the next time?

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.227 align:middle line:84%
What can I learn
from this experience

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:28.796 align:middle line:90%
that I can serve others?

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:31.598 align:middle line:84%
What can -- what is the
universe trying to tell me?

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:35.102 align:middle line:84%
There's another also -- this is
70 individual little articles

00:05:35.102 --> 00:05:39.006 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is called
it's a universal redirect.

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.975 align:middle line:90%
Things aren't necessarily bad.

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:43.977 align:middle line:90%
We assign that value to it.

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:47.314 align:middle line:84%
It's the universe giving
you a sign that you need

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.348 align:middle line:90%
to go a different direction.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.383 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a problem.

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:50.584 align:middle line:90%
It's not a headache.

00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not an obstacle, it's
a universal redistrict.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And even a
challenge is actually could be a

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:90%
good news.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Exactly.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You just have to look
at it differently.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.629 align:middle line:84%
So all of those things will
raise your personal frequency.

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.265 align:middle line:90%
So that's step number three.

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:07.434 align:middle line:84%
Step number four is
what you talked about.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:84%
Clarity. Getting very very clear
on what it is that you want

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.674 align:middle line:90%
to manifest in your life.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:17.077 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where things
get really interesting.

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Many people who saw the secret
which had wonderful value

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.684 align:middle line:84%
but they went out and
they tried to manifest.

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:27.588 align:middle line:84%
And things didn't come to them
the way that they had wanted.

00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:29.156 align:middle line:90%
And one of the reasons is is

00:06:29.156 --> 00:06:33.961 align:middle line:84%
because here they are having
a high frequency desire

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.929 align:middle line:84%
but they're at the
same time giving

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:40.801 align:middle line:84%
out low frequency
energy to the universe.

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:42.603 align:middle line:84%
They're worried it's
not going to happen.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:46.073 align:middle line:84%
They're choking it off with
their anxiety and their worry.

00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
They are convinced nothing
good happens to them.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.445 align:middle line:90%
Or they're not worthy.

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:53.313 align:middle line:84%
All of that negative
energy going

00:06:53.313 --> 00:06:57.351 align:middle line:84%
out into the world is counter
acting the positive high energy

00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:59.887 align:middle line:84%
image that you want
to experience.

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle line:84%
So in order for you
to actually be able

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.091 align:middle line:90%
to be a manifester you have

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.494 align:middle line:84%
to raise your personal frequency
beyond a high frequency,

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and do your manifesting
at the same time.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.798 align:middle line:84%
And that's when fast
things begin to happen.

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:15.068 align:middle line:84%
So the universe has to get
really clear on what it is

00:07:15.068 --> 00:07:18.171 align:middle line:84%
that you want, and sense
your positive energy

00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.207 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:21.708 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: But is there
-- is there sometimes --

00:07:21.708 --> 00:07:24.177 align:middle line:84%
could there be sometimes a
challenge of like we're trying

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:25.279 align:middle line:90%
to manifest somethings

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.281 align:middle line:84%
that might not be the
best for ourselves?

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Oh, yeah.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:28.849 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:29.917 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes people try

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:32.619 align:middle line:84%
to manifest too much
at the same time.

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:34.454 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want the
lottery ticket, you know.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yeah.

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:36.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: When in
fact you're better off

00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:40.160 align:middle line:84%
to say I need 5000
dollars to achieve this.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:90%
Or I need to be better at this.

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:45.399 align:middle line:90%
Or I need a coach or a mentor.

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.434 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
we talk about manifesting,

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:51.171 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the big ticket
items, it's not about the house

00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.407 align:middle line:84%
and the car and all
those things.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
quality of life.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:84%
So it may be somebody
to help you.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It might be a mentor.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:84%
It might be somebody to
help you with your kids.

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:04.818 align:middle line:84%
It might be your kids
picking up their trash.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:08.455 align:middle line:84%
It's anything that's going
to improve the quality

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.958 align:middle line:84%
of your life, more
time with your family,

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.895 align:middle line:84%
more time to be inside
of yourself.

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:18.332 align:middle line:84%
So you can manifest for all of
those things and it doesn't have

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:90%
to be the big ticket items.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.871 align:middle line:84%
So you know, so you want to be
clear about what it is you want.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.774 align:middle line:84%
And you want to choose
carefully.

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not going
to discourage people

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.746 align:middle line:84%
from dreaming about
the big stuff.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:35.147 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that really is
one of the blessings

00:08:35.147 --> 00:08:38.185 align:middle line:84%
of sometimes the universe
will produce the miracles.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.953 align:middle line:90%
That's a fabulous part of it.

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:43.022 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes starting
slowly also enables you

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.691 align:middle line:90%
to build confidence.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
see things manifest,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.096 align:middle line:84%
the more you think
I'm a manifester.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:51.465 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:52.265 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:53.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Tell us more

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.069 align:middle line:84%
about the clarity
that we need gain.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Is that really a matter of
having exactly a number in mind

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.011 align:middle line:84%
or specific goal or is it
more as you said something

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:06.546 align:middle line:84%
in the quality of it and
the experience of it.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.316 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems as we
progressing and applying the law

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
of attraction it's a bit
shifting towards that.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:84%
Like I would love to attract a
peaceful day and things working

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:18.659 align:middle line:84%
out effortlessly and
abundance to show up and life

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.628 align:middle line:84%
to surprise me, kind
of declarations.

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:22.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Absolutely.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:25.365 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the components

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:27.434 align:middle line:84%
of that is the fifth
step we're going to talk

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:32.806 align:middle line:84%
about which is experiencing as
if it was actually happening.

00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:37.978 align:middle line:84%
So you want to create a mind
movie of your life as --

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.447 align:middle line:90%
when this manifests for you.

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:43.383 align:middle line:84%
So you want to put
yourself in that space

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:45.419 align:middle line:90%
so that your actually there.

00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:47.788 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
experiencing it you want

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:50.457 align:middle line:90%
to feel it, taste it, sense it.

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:51.992 align:middle line:84%
And most important
because we talked

00:09:51.992 --> 00:09:58.065 align:middle line:84%
about our emotions being the
silver bullet most importantly

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:01.702 align:middle line:84%
you have to feel what it is
that you would be feeling.

00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:02.803 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel love.

00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:03.837 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel joy.

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:04.871 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel excitement.

00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:06.406 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel abundance.

00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:08.575 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel healthy.

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:09.743 align:middle line:90%
All of these things.

00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.978 align:middle line:84%
So and what is it that
you would experience

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:14.147 align:middle line:90%
to feel when your doing that.

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.283 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we talk

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:19.986 align:middle line:84%
about in the book is
frequency matching.

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:24.491 align:middle line:84%
You want to match the frequency
that you want to experience.

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:28.161 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to experience
love you must be love.

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to experience joy
you want to feel joyful even

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.936 align:middle line:84%
if maybe your life
isn't perfect.

00:10:35.936 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to feel abundant
feel and sense and spend

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.342 align:middle line:90%
as if you were abundant.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:45.846 align:middle line:90%
Not over spend but be generous.

00:10:45.846 --> 00:10:49.148 align:middle line:84%
Give to the people in your
neighbor who are in need.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:52.953 align:middle line:84%
Do something that makes you
feel like you are -- you are --

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.856 align:middle line:84%
you have the gift of
abundance that you can share.

00:10:55.856 --> 00:11:00.227 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be on that -- be
aware that what the frequency

00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to
manifest is the one

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.898 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying
to bring back.

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So get yourself into
that emotional place

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.102 align:middle line:90%
so that you can experience it.

00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:11.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And how about
if there is a gap like somebody

00:11:11.805 --> 00:11:16.777 align:middle line:84%
that wants to experience
abundance, they're giving,

00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.379 align:middle line:84%
but they might feel, oh, my
God, but I have less for myself.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
like something

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.883 align:middle line:84%
that needs maybe to
be healed, right?

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:25.452 align:middle line:84%
There's a healing process
in all of this, I guess.

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:26.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: You bet.

00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.555 align:middle line:84%
There's very much a
healing process in this.

00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:30.924 align:middle line:84%
And you need to look
at the limiting beliefs

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.194 align:middle line:84%
that are making you feel
that you're unworthy

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.196 align:middle line:90%
or that money is not --

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
not something --
it's tainted somehow.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Or that you -- it
goes to other people.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.971 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flow to you.

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:49.075 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, certainly
there are many people

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:53.046 align:middle line:84%
who are suffering today because
of job losses and all of that.

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.449 align:middle line:84%
But it's not -- it's
not what's in your past

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:58.652 align:middle line:90%
because today is a new day.

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:02.856 align:middle line:84%
And you can become an effective
and beautiful manifester right

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:06.526 align:middle line:84%
from today by letting go
of what was in that past.

00:12:06.526 --> 00:12:09.796 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be the same
person that you were a week ago,

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:13.233 align:middle line:84%
today, as you begin to raise
your frequency and realize

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.769 align:middle line:90%
that you are deserving.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:19.639 align:middle line:84%
That you are not
only abundant --

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk about the
money tree in a little bit.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.812 align:middle line:90%
But that you are divine.

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And as a divine being you
have the ability to create

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.453 align:middle line:84%
in so many ways and
to be in flow.

00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:37.791 align:middle line:84%
I open my day every day with a
beautiful little ritual of being

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:40.827 align:middle line:84%
in flow with the
universe, in flow with love.

00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:45.999 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that I'm connected
in so that I always remember

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:50.737 align:middle line:84%
that what I am here to do
is to be a servant of God

00:12:50.737 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
on this planet and
to be a messenger.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.445 align:middle line:84%
And to remember that that is
how I must live in my day.

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:02.449 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part of what
allows me to be an effective

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.985 align:middle line:84%
and fast manifester because
I know that I'm connected

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:07.554 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just
me, that I have help.

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:84%
That it's not just
laws, it is a force.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:16.396 align:middle line:84%
A power that is gracious
and graceful.

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:22.002 align:middle line:84%
And so I am so deeply grateful
for my understanding of this

00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:24.337 align:middle line:90%
and my ability to share it.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:27.173 align:middle line:84%
So -- so let's talk
about the fifth step now

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:29.476 align:middle line:90%
that we've got that one.

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:32.212 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's the
sixth step, sorry.

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:36.349 align:middle line:84%
The sixth step is called
becoming an actionary.

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:41.688 align:middle line:84%
This is very important because
you can't just imagine things

00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:43.456 align:middle line:90%
and be a couch potato.

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:46.993 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually get off
that couch and go do something.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
Most people think that the
universe is out to get them.

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.867 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is the universe
is actually conspiring

00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.402 align:middle line:90%
in your behalf.

00:13:55.402 --> 00:13:57.504 align:middle line:84%
And the minute that
you actually start

00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:00.473 align:middle line:90%
to take action you will discover

00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:03.176 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
will support you.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
So I have a one little analogy
in the book that's really fun

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.649 align:middle line:84%
in the chapter that we talk
about called commitment.

00:14:09.649 --> 00:14:12.585 align:middle line:84%
When you make a commitment
imagine this,

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:16.690 align:middle line:84%
there's this little Indiana
Jones guy who's racing,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.992 align:middle line:84%
you know, to beat the bad guys
that are right behind them

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:21.194 align:middle line:90%
and he comes to this giant chasm

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.929 align:middle line:84%
and there's no bridge
over the chasm.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:24.431 align:middle line:90%
And he says, what do I do?

00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.567 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little
Yoda creature standing

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle line:84%
by who says, take
the first step.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And he takes that
first step and low

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.575 align:middle line:90%
and behold the bridge appears.

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.344 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
footstep on the bridge

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:38.645 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
step on the bridge

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:41.181 align:middle line:90%
until he's all the way across.

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:43.148 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
universe works.

00:14:43.148 --> 00:14:45.318 align:middle line:90%
If you take that first step

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:48.521 align:middle line:84%
in faith then the next
step will be appear.

00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:50.123 align:middle line:90%
You will be guided.

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:52.926 align:middle line:84%
You will -- somebody will
show up in your life.

00:14:52.926 --> 00:14:55.328 align:middle line:84%
Some opportunity
will present itself.

00:14:55.328 --> 00:14:58.064 align:middle line:84%
You'll suddenly get clarity
about where you're headed

00:14:58.064 --> 00:14:59.833 align:middle line:90%
and what you want to do.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:03.036 align:middle line:84%
It's really stunningly
amazing that when you start

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:06.306 align:middle line:84%
to take action the
universe aligns all

00:15:06.306 --> 00:15:08.208 align:middle line:90%
that you need in front of you.

00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:11.978 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may not be going where
you think it's going to go.

00:15:11.978 --> 00:15:14.981 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes like you said
we don't always have our best

00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:16.282 align:middle line:90%
interest at heart.

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:19.753 align:middle line:84%
But the universe does know
what our best interest are.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:24.057 align:middle line:84%
And it will guide you in a way
that is in your highest good.

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:27.627 align:middle line:84%
And so the biggest issue
then is being flexible.

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:29.262 align:middle line:84%
And not being inflexible
and saying

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:90%
but that's not what I wanted.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.799 align:middle line:90%
That's not how I imagined it.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:35.769 align:middle line:84%
It's not what I chose
to manifest.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:42.709 align:middle line:84%
Listen. Be grateful
and adaptable.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:45.879 align:middle line:84%
Oh, okay. Well, then the
universe must be telling me

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.781 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
I need to know here.

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.549 align:middle line:90%
And then follow that path.

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.352 align:middle line:84%
And you will be guided
in a positive direction.

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:54.287 align:middle line:90%
So that's step number six.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.157 align:middle line:90%
And the last is to begin

00:15:57.157 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to adapt practical
conscious creation

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.796 align:middle line:84%
which is basically raising
your personal frequency

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.832 align:middle line:84%
into everything that
you do day by day.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:10.036 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn how to
anchor the law of attraction

00:16:10.036 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:84%
and conscious creation
principles that we're talking

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.773 align:middle line:90%
about into your daily life

00:16:13.773 --> 00:16:17.944 align:middle line:84%
so that you can become a better
faster manifester day by day.

00:16:17.944 --> 00:16:20.647 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's lots of
books and concepts out there

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:22.916 align:middle line:90%
on the big idea of manifesting.

00:16:22.916 --> 00:16:24.651 align:middle line:90%
But the real important value

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:29.422 align:middle line:84%
of this is incorporating
this into your daily life.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:32.725 align:middle line:84%
So that it becomes
a way of life.

00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:35.728 align:middle line:90%
So that we all then --

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.064 align:middle line:84%
it becomes natural,
second nature to you.

00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:39.833 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the objective.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: So
what is really --

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:44.337 align:middle line:84%
how about if we really not
seeing it happening and we keep

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.439 align:middle line:84%
on obsessing on the fact
that it's not happening.

00:16:46.439 --> 00:16:48.708 align:middle line:84%
What do you recommend
in those moments?

00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:50.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Well, if you're
obsessing you're choking off

00:16:50.477 --> 00:16:51.878 align:middle line:90%
the energy.

00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:57.016 align:middle line:84%
So what you really have to do is
let go and relax and have faith

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.185 align:middle line:84%
and things will manifest
in your good.

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I learned, you know,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:04.756 align:middle line:84%
I have a PR agency that
specializes in mind body spirit

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:09.262 align:middle line:84%
and for many years when I was
doing more main stream PR I was

00:17:09.262 --> 00:17:11.264 align:middle line:84%
very worried about where
the money was going to come

00:17:11.264 --> 00:17:16.469 align:middle line:84%
because I had a big staff and
it made me anxious and worried

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:19.505 align:middle line:84%
and I was always up late
at night trying to figure

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:22.041 align:middle line:84%
out where this money
was going to come from.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.211 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I began to
walk this path I realized

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.113 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
takes care of me.

00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:31.317 align:middle line:84%
And I relaxed and I let go and
you know what that money shows

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:36.623 align:middle line:84%
up every month and takes care
of me and the people around me.

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:39.993 align:middle line:84%
It is just amazing and I
don't worry about it any more.

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:45.398 align:middle line:84%
My life certainly is not
ideal, it's not perfect.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:49.269 align:middle line:84%
But I'm taken care of and I know
that that is going to happen.

00:17:49.269 --> 00:17:53.673 align:middle line:84%
So the more you relax, the
more you allow the universe

00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
to take care of you,
the more you surrender

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:01.047 align:middle line:84%
and become adaptable, the
more things manifest for you.

00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: I was thinking of
the relationships, for example,

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:08.221 align:middle line:84%
when we have relationships with
others and we see letting go

00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.657 align:middle line:84%
of control is something
that you speak also of.

00:18:10.657 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:84%
And we have a certain
way of seeing things

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:15.161 align:middle line:84%
and things might
not be manifested

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.263 align:middle line:84%
or happening the
way we envision it.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.999 align:middle line:84%
What is your recommendation
about that when we're stuck

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:25.271 align:middle line:84%
in a thought and we're
not seeing it manifest.

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.541 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes we feel
powerless in situations

00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:32.345 align:middle line:84%
with others in relationships,
personal relationship,

00:18:32.345 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
work relationship, romantic.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Well, you
know, there's only one person

00:18:36.783 --> 00:18:37.817 align:middle line:90%
that you can control

00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:40.186 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship
and that's yourself.

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:44.624 align:middle line:84%
And if you are focussing on all
of the things that are wrong

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:47.794 align:middle line:84%
in the relationship, that's what
you're going to create more of.

00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
What we focus on is
what we manifest.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.568 align:middle line:84%
So what you really
really want to do is focus

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:58.104 align:middle line:84%
on raising your own
personal frequency.

00:18:58.104 --> 00:19:02.742 align:middle line:84%
And there's an article in
here called staying positive

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.944 align:middle line:90%
with a negative energy spouse.

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:07.814 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an important
lesson because what happens --

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:10.583 align:middle line:84%
three things happen when
you get into relationships.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:13.753 align:middle line:84%
And you start raising
your frequency.

00:19:13.753 --> 00:19:18.925 align:middle line:84%
One is that the other
person may look at you

00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:21.494 align:middle line:90%
and say, what happened?

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.364 align:middle line:90%
Wow. I want what she's having.

00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:27.834 align:middle line:84%
Remember when Harry met Sally,
I want what she's having.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.369 align:middle line:90%
So they begin to follow you.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:33.406 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is as you raise
your personal frequency there is

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:36.175 align:middle line:84%
a tuning fork phenomenon
that happens.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.745 align:middle line:84%
They may begin to
raise their frequency.

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:42.348 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that fosters that is

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:45.652 align:middle line:84%
if you're changing
how you relate to them

00:19:45.652 --> 00:19:47.987 align:middle line:90%
because you're no longer getting

00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:51.291 align:middle line:84%
into that hot button state
you're letting them be

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.492 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:55.995 align:middle line:84%
You're loving them despite
how they're behaving.

00:19:55.995 --> 00:20:00.533 align:middle line:84%
You're accepting whatever it is
that they are choosing to put

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.102 align:middle line:84%
out into the world and
not taking it personally.

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:06.906 align:middle line:84%
When you start changing
they have to start changing

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:11.177 align:middle line:84%
because you're not giving them
the same dynamics to work with.

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:12.578 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
thing that happens,

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:16.215 align:middle line:84%
and this is sometimes very sad
we have to let go of people

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:19.786 align:middle line:84%
that don't come along
on our pathway.

00:20:19.786 --> 00:20:22.188 align:middle line:84%
That are not raising
their frequency

00:20:22.188 --> 00:20:25.091 align:middle line:90%
and are not supporting us.

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:27.894 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it happens in a
marriage, sometimes it happens

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:31.264 align:middle line:84%
with family, and it's
very sad but it's

00:20:31.264 --> 00:20:34.367 align:middle line:84%
in our best interest not to
be held back by relationships

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.035 align:middle line:90%
that are not healthy for us.

00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:90%
We need to let go.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.238 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that
you have to cut it off.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:42.008 align:middle line:84%
But it might just mean that you
just don't spend a lot of time

00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:44.544 align:middle line:84%
with that person any more or
your start finding other people.

00:20:44.544 --> 00:20:46.979 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
is happened is when I started

00:20:46.979 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
on this path I realized
that I did not have a lot

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:58.491 align:middle line:84%
of other friends who believed in
all of this really powerful law

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:00.426 align:middle line:84%
of attraction, mind,
body, spirit.

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.695 align:middle line:90%
And so I asked the universe

00:21:02.695 --> 00:21:05.298 align:middle line:84%
to grant me more friends
that were like this.

00:21:05.298 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And man they just started
showing up one after another

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.204 align:middle line:84%
and my life is populated by
wonderful supportive people.

00:21:11.204 --> 00:21:15.174 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I wanted in
my PR business, I wanted kind

00:21:15.174 --> 00:21:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and loving and supportive
clients.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.846 align:middle line:84%
And I've weeded out
all of the other ones

00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:22.348 align:middle line:90%
and that's all I have left.

00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:26.452 align:middle line:84%
So it's really --
you have the power

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:31.591 align:middle line:84%
to change those relationships
or shape the degree

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of relationships around you
that you want to engage with.

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: So give really
yourself the chance to best --

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:43.503 align:middle line:84%
to live the best life that you
can because sometimes we --

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:45.338 align:middle line:90%
we don't even go to that --

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:47.407 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's brilliant
what you did just wanting

00:21:47.407 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:84%
to live extraordinary
relationships and have that --

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.644 align:middle line:90%
but sometimes we don't even see

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.212 align:middle line:84%
that we could actually
have that.

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:55.348 align:middle line:90%
You know, we're --

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:58.084 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: We
can have what we intend

00:21:58.084 --> 00:21:59.786 align:middle line:90%
and that's really what it is.

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.187 align:middle line:90%
We have -- can have --

00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
but we have to let go of what's
not healthy for us first.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.162 align:middle line:84%
And recognize that banging
our heads against the wall

00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:16.969 align:middle line:84%
in an unhealthy relationship is
not going to allow us to grow.

00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:20.306 align:middle line:84%
We have to be in this
place of expansion.

00:22:20.306 --> 00:22:22.308 align:middle line:90%
Trust and expansion.

00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:25.812 align:middle line:84%
And if we are clinging to
the old, if we're clinging

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:31.217 align:middle line:84%
to negative thinking,
negative perspectives,

00:22:31.217 --> 00:22:36.022 align:middle line:84%
negative relationships,
then we can't expand.

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:40.893 align:middle line:84%
You have to let all of that go
in order to go into the future.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:45.098 align:middle line:84%
Free, open, infinite
possibilities

00:22:45.098 --> 00:22:47.033 align:middle line:90%
and which there are.

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.234 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Can
you tell us about some

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:50.503 align:middle line:90%
of the universal principles?

00:22:50.503 --> 00:22:52.171 align:middle line:84%
I know you get to
speak about them

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:55.408 align:middle line:84%
and love yourself love yourself
love yourself is one of them.

00:22:55.408 --> 00:22:56.943 align:middle line:90%
But it's essential isn't it.

00:22:56.943 --> 00:22:58.611 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us --
can you remind us

00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
of those universal
principles that comes

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.048 align:middle line:90%
to your mind right now.

00:23:02.048 --> 00:23:05.051 align:middle line:84%
I know there's 25 of them but,
you know, you might have some

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.653 align:middle line:84%
that pop there and that are
maybe more present for you.

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Well, one of
them is all about what we speak.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.593 align:middle line:84%
Because what we speak
is what we manifest.

00:23:13.593 --> 00:23:14.727 align:middle line:90%
And so the words that we put --

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:17.163 align:middle line:84%
we have to be very
careful about what we say.

00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:19.532 align:middle line:84%
If we say well, I'm not
really good at that.

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:26.272 align:middle line:84%
Or I -- or to somebody
else if you speak partially

00:23:26.272 --> 00:23:29.809 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else those words
have a way to come back at us.

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle line:84%
If you are unkind to
somebody you're, one,

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.481 align:middle line:84%
never going to get what
you want from them.

00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:38.951 align:middle line:84%
However, if you speak to
somebody as if you respect them

00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:42.088 align:middle line:84%
or you think that they
will live up to --

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.223 align:middle line:84%
maybe they haven't in the
past but they will live

00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:46.092 align:middle line:84%
up to these wonderful
expectations --

00:23:46.092 --> 00:23:48.661 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
to say expectations.

00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:53.266 align:middle line:84%
They will live up to their
own infinite possibilities,

00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:55.568 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
give you a lot more.

00:23:55.568 --> 00:23:57.036 align:middle line:90%
They're going to support you.

00:23:57.036 --> 00:24:00.006 align:middle line:84%
They may actually live up
to what your opportunity --

00:24:00.006 --> 00:24:02.074 align:middle line:84%
giving them the opportunity
to do.

00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:05.278 align:middle line:84%
But if you denigrate
somebody, if you are unkind

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:84%
to them then clearly
they are not going

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:10.816 align:middle line:90%
to show you their best side.

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're interacting
with them in a way

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:90%
that is not life enhancing.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:18.691 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we each have a choice.

00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:84%
The choices that we have in life
are are they life destructive

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:90%
or are they life enhancing.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.631 align:middle line:90%
And each choice that we make

00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:30.903 align:middle line:84%
if you ask yourself is this life
enhancing, is this expansive?

00:24:30.903 --> 00:24:32.572 align:middle line:84%
That will tell you
which way to go.

00:24:32.572 --> 00:24:33.339 align:middle line:90%
And then feel it.

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Feel it in your body.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:39.011 align:middle line:84%
If you feel contraction that's
not somewhere you want to go.

00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:90%
You know, we talked --

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:84%
we started to talk a
little bit about money.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:45.785 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
that people continue

00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:50.223 align:middle line:84%
to perpetuate their financial
problems is the more you focus

00:24:50.223 --> 00:24:54.193 align:middle line:84%
on struggle the more
struggle you will experience.

00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:56.529 align:middle line:84%
The universe will
create opportunities

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:58.764 align:middle line:90%
for you to feel struggle.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:02.101 align:middle line:84%
The best thing that you can
do is focus on your abundance.

00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:03.402 align:middle line:90%
And feel abundant.

00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:07.239 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this wonderful
little guided meditation.

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.475 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a video
on my web site.

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:11.377 align:middle line:90%
It's called the money tree.

00:25:11.377 --> 00:25:15.281 align:middle line:84%
And if you just imagine for
a moment you can do this

00:25:15.281 --> 00:25:17.783 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes closed or
eyes open whatever you like.

00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:21.253 align:middle line:84%
You just imagine that you
have swallowed a little seed

00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and that seed imbeds itself
in your tummy and then all

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:29.328 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it simply
begins to grow a trunk.

00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:32.098 align:middle line:84%
And from that trunk
grows branchs.

00:25:32.098 --> 00:25:34.634 align:middle line:90%
And then low and behold everyone

00:25:34.634 --> 00:25:38.271 align:middle line:84%
of those branchs has
beautiful green leaves.

00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:43.309 align:middle line:84%
And each of those green leaves
is a thousand dollar bill.

00:25:43.309 --> 00:25:45.478 align:middle line:84%
Now you pluck one of those
thousand dollar bills

00:25:45.478 --> 00:25:47.446 align:middle line:90%
and you go spend it.

00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, my gosh, the next one
grows right back in its place.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.121 align:middle line:84%
And you go and you spend the
next one and there it is again.

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:56.622 align:middle line:90%
Now, all you have to realize

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:59.425 align:middle line:84%
that you are an ever
abundant money tree.

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.928 align:middle line:84%
All you do is need to nurture
it, support it, and love it,

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:06.565 align:middle line:84%
and the universe will also
nurture, support, and love it.

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.502 align:middle line:84%
And you will be an ever
abundant money tree.

00:26:09.502 --> 00:26:11.737 align:middle line:84%
And I actually have
a little imagine

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:13.673 align:middle line:84%
on my web site that
you can go get.

00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:16.742 align:middle line:84%
You want to put a picture of the
money tree on your picture --

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:20.079 align:middle line:84%
on your mirror or by your
bed or on your vision board.

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.048 align:middle line:84%
You can get your own little
money tree and put it there

00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:24.517 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that you're
an ever abundant money tree

00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:29.355 align:middle line:84%
and can produce oodles of
money if you are frequently --

00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:31.724 align:middle line:84%
believing in your own power
of your own frequency.

00:26:31.724 --> 00:26:33.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: You said a
couple of times spend it

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and then you will see that it
comes back or is it really --

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:84%
is it a must part
to actually spend

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.636 align:middle line:84%
that money those
thousand dollars

00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:46.238 align:middle line:90%
and witnessing it coming back.

00:26:46.238 --> 00:26:48.074 align:middle line:90%
Is it really -- I mean do we --

00:26:48.074 --> 00:26:50.509 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
teachers on the secret

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:53.713 align:middle line:84%
and you're also saying
this we need to spend.

00:26:53.713 --> 00:26:55.748 align:middle line:84%
Is it really a matter
of spending?

00:26:55.748 --> 00:26:57.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: You know
spending isn't necessarily

00:26:57.516 --> 00:26:59.118 align:middle line:90%
just money.

00:26:59.118 --> 00:27:01.187 align:middle line:90%
It's from -- it's your heart.

00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:03.956 align:middle line:84%
So people say to me
well I'm really mired

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.692 align:middle line:84%
and had my life is terrible,
et cetera, what can I do

00:27:06.692 --> 00:27:08.027 align:middle line:90%
to get out of this place.

00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:10.796 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I tell
them is go help somebody else.

00:27:10.796 --> 00:27:16.135 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are giving
to others, first it gets you

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:18.404 align:middle line:90%
out of your bad head space.

00:27:18.404 --> 00:27:22.508 align:middle line:84%
Second you feel their
gratitude coming back.

00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:26.445 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you feel
better about yourself.

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:31.884 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a spiral upward
instead of a spiral downward.

00:27:31.884 --> 00:27:36.989 align:middle line:84%
So it's really vital for you
to give in all kinds of ways.

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:38.057 align:middle line:90%
It could be your time.

00:27:38.057 --> 00:27:39.358 align:middle line:90%
It might be money.

00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:41.827 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly it's
whatever you can give

00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.696 align:middle line:90%
from your heart.

00:27:43.696 --> 00:27:45.598 align:middle line:90%
Caring, loving, support.

00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:54.673 align:middle line:84%
When you are unaware and
unconscious then in fact cause

00:27:55.508 --> 00:27:57.176 align:middle line:90%
and effect is very real for you.

00:27:57.176 --> 00:28:00.112 align:middle line:84%
You may not be aware when all
of a sudden you get slammed

00:28:00.112 --> 00:28:02.181 align:middle line:84%
and you think why did
this happen to me?

00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, you really have to
look back at what you did.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.786 align:middle line:84%
And it might be something
in a past life,

00:28:06.786 --> 00:28:08.721 align:middle line:84%
but very more often
it is something

00:28:08.721 --> 00:28:11.023 align:middle line:90%
that we did in our own lives.

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:14.527 align:middle line:84%
However, when you
become conscious

00:28:14.527 --> 00:28:17.396 align:middle line:84%
and when you realize -- and
this happened for me, you know,

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:22.468 align:middle line:84%
at one point in my early career
I realized that when I started

00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:26.772 align:middle line:84%
down a path that was not
necessarily an honorable one I

00:28:26.772 --> 00:28:28.374 align:middle line:90%
paid the price.

00:28:28.374 --> 00:28:29.975 align:middle line:90%
Something would happen.

00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:36.715 align:middle line:84%
Yet when I stayed on a pathway
that was in keeping with right

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.284 align:middle line:90%
and honest -- honesty

00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:41.587 align:middle line:84%
and integrity I was
always taken care of.

00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:43.656 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
my first awakening.

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:46.358 align:middle line:84%
That there was a divine
presence in my life.

00:28:46.358 --> 00:28:50.196 align:middle line:84%
And it's very -- you become
-- you can train yourself.

00:28:50.196 --> 00:28:53.232 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize okay, I'm
starting to step off the path.

00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go there.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.902 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to experience
the consequences

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:58.537 align:middle line:90%
of that, the cause and effect.

00:28:58.537 --> 00:29:01.941 align:middle line:84%
I would choose to -- I want to
be taken care of so I'm going

00:29:01.941 --> 00:29:04.577 align:middle line:90%
to stay on this path instead.

00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:07.613 align:middle line:84%
So cause and effect
is in effect.

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:09.815 align:middle line:84%
But you can use it
to your benefit.

00:29:09.815 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And know that obviously
good deeds are rewarded.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.655 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to do
them for that purpose.

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:20.059 align:middle line:84%
You want to do them
because that is who you are.

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:21.827 align:middle line:90%
You are a citizen of the world.

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:23.829 align:middle line:90%
A citizen of the oneness.

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:28.434 align:middle line:84%
The universe responds to
your most recent action.

00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:31.604 align:middle line:84%
So it wipes out all
the stuff in the past

00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:34.039 align:middle line:84%
if you make the next
positive step.

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:39.044 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
sayings is if you --

00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:42.615 align:middle line:84%
something comes out of your
mouth that you don't want

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:45.784 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and you think, oh
my God, why did I say that?

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:47.253 align:middle line:90%
The universe will hear that.

00:29:47.253 --> 00:29:49.555 align:middle line:84%
You can simply say
cancel, cancel.

00:29:49.555 --> 00:29:52.958 align:middle line:84%
And then restate it in
a positive framework

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
in what you really
do want to happen.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.163 align:middle line:90%
And the universe will hear that.

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:02.301 align:middle line:84%
So it's what you've done most
recently that will matter.

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:05.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: In regarding
the unconditional aspects is

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:09.074 align:middle line:84%
that something that you
have witnessed that works?

00:30:09.074 --> 00:30:12.211 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Well,
certainly when we are in an un--

00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:15.681 align:middle line:84%
when we are in a state of
unconditional love that's

00:30:15.681 --> 00:30:18.684 align:middle line:84%
when we will attract
unconditional love.

00:30:18.684 --> 00:30:21.687 align:middle line:84%
When we are conditional in our
love and in our relationships

00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:25.157 align:middle line:84%
and in a state of
judgment you will find

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:28.827 align:middle line:90%
that you will be judged.

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:32.131 align:middle line:84%
You will experience
the same in exchange.

00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:35.334 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a women
that worked with me --

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:38.304 align:middle line:84%
a lovely women but
she had one fatal flaw

00:30:38.304 --> 00:30:40.639 align:middle line:84%
in that she always
thought she was right

00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:42.574 align:middle line:84%
and would never admit
to, you know,

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:44.310 align:middle line:84%
any errors that she
might have made.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.644 align:middle line:90%
And when I confronted her

00:30:45.644 --> 00:30:49.648 align:middle line:84%
about this it was never
a happy situation.

00:30:49.648 --> 00:30:53.752 align:middle line:84%
But when I learned to speak to
her differently and I would say,

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:55.721 align:middle line:84%
oh, look what we did,
we made this error.

00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:57.156 align:middle line:90%
It was we, not her.

00:30:57.156 --> 00:30:58.524 align:middle line:90%
It was we.

00:30:58.524 --> 00:31:00.859 align:middle line:84%
You know and since, you know,
let's just take care of this

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.795 align:middle line:84%
and make sure we
don't do it next time,

00:31:02.795 --> 00:31:03.929 align:middle line:90%
there was never an issue.

00:31:03.929 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
She took care of it.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.965 align:middle line:90%
The problem was solved.

00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:06.832 align:middle line:90%
We laughed about it.

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:07.366 align:middle line:90%
We had fun.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.867 align:middle line:90%
We moved on.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:14.239 align:middle line:84%
And it was all in my respect
for her as a human being

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:17.443 align:middle line:84%
and her understanding that
she wasn't deliberately trying

00:31:17.443 --> 00:31:19.578 align:middle line:90%
to do something wrong.

00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:22.147 align:middle line:84%
But she needed a little guidance
and support and I could do

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:27.186 align:middle line:84%
that in a kinder way with
love attached to it as opposed

00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:30.856 align:middle line:84%
to judgment attached to it
and things began to change.

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:33.392 align:middle line:84%
And our relationship got
a million times better.

00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Beautiful
example.

00:31:34.693 --> 00:31:36.996 align:middle line:84%
Is there some other things
that you would like to share

00:31:36.996 --> 00:31:39.465 align:middle line:84%
with us today as part
of this interview

00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:43.569 align:middle line:84%
on really becoming conscious
creators in our life?

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:45.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin:
Well, I think that one

00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:47.573 align:middle line:90%
of the most important things is

00:31:47.573 --> 00:31:52.978 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize
our own divinity.

00:31:52.978 --> 00:31:59.018 align:middle line:84%
And be aware that we
are beings of love.

00:31:59.018 --> 00:32:02.321 align:middle line:84%
And that we need be
softer to ourselves,

00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:08.427 align:middle line:84%
forgive ourselves more,
recognize that it's okay

00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:14.133 align:middle line:84%
to have fun in life,
that we are --

00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:20.873 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to life then
all the busyness, that we have

00:32:20.873 --> 00:32:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to take time to be
instead of just do.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.844 align:middle line:90%
I'm guilty of that.

00:32:25.844 --> 00:32:27.046 align:middle line:90%
I will admit.

00:32:27.046 --> 00:32:29.014 align:middle line:90%
We all have to have recharge.

00:32:29.014 --> 00:32:32.151 align:middle line:84%
If we're running on empty
we can't allow the energy

00:32:32.151 --> 00:32:34.319 align:middle line:90%
to fill us back up.

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:37.523 align:middle line:84%
So we need to give ourselves
the ability to recharge

00:32:37.523 --> 00:32:41.026 align:middle line:84%
that positive beautiful
energy that sustains us.

00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:44.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Clarify something
here because of the expectation

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:47.633 align:middle line:84%
versus -- versus
setting the intention

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.235 align:middle line:84%
and really being
clear and all of that.

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:54.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Expectation is
saying you know, I, you know,

00:32:54.173 --> 00:33:00.479 align:middle line:84%
I'm going -- I'm going to make
a million dollars this year.

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:01.613 align:middle line:90%
And you don't.

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:04.416 align:middle line:84%
Or this person is
going to give me this.

00:33:04.416 --> 00:33:05.751 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:10.589 align:middle line:84%
If you go in with a preconceived
notion of what is going

00:33:10.589 --> 00:33:14.827 align:middle line:84%
to happen, then you could
very well be disappointed.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:18.063 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do is
go in with the attitude

00:33:18.063 --> 00:33:19.898 align:middle line:84%
of whatever happens
is going to be fine.

00:33:19.898 --> 00:33:21.266 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be wonderful.

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:22.468 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be great.

00:33:22.468 --> 00:33:25.437 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if it's a little
challenging I'll figure

00:33:25.437 --> 00:33:28.807 align:middle line:90%
out I have the divine gift.

00:33:28.807 --> 00:33:30.109 align:middle line:90%
I have guidance.

00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
It will take me in
the right direction.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.579 align:middle line:90%
So we'll figure it out.

00:33:33.579 --> 00:33:37.349 align:middle line:84%
Just go with the knowledge
that everything will work out.

00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:39.218 align:middle line:90%
That's another key phrase.

00:33:39.218 --> 00:33:41.887 align:middle line:84%
Here's some really
important key phrase.

00:33:41.887 --> 00:33:44.456 align:middle line:90%
All is well.

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:47.059 align:middle line:84%
Everything will work
out for the best.

00:33:47.059 --> 00:33:48.527 align:middle line:90%
And when you do.

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:49.862 align:middle line:90%
When you make that assumption.

00:33:49.862 --> 00:33:51.663 align:middle line:90%
When your work from that place

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:55.100 align:middle line:84%
in your life everything
will work out for the best.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: And
gratitude paves the way.

00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:58.871 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Absolutely.

00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:00.272 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:01.874 align:middle line:90%
When you are in a state

00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:06.979 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude you will have
more to be grateful for.

00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:11.650 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most
basic simple universal laws.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:12.718 align:middle line:90%
It comes to you.

00:34:12.718 --> 00:34:14.218 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:23.295 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude is the grease, you
know, that oils the universe.

00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:25.764 align:middle line:90%
And it makes everything easier.

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
tell people is when you are

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.838 align:middle line:84%
in a state of contraction
go to the beach,

00:34:32.838 --> 00:34:35.407 align:middle line:84%
go get in a pool,
go take a shower.

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:40.445 align:middle line:84%
Any of those things will help
you get the energy flowing.

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:44.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean I get my best ideas
in the shower all the time.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.517 align:middle line:90%
And I go --

00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:46.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: Because
you're a mermaid.

00:34:46.218 --> 00:34:46.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Yes.

00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:51.189 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:57.262 align:middle line:84%
We are all -- energy in
water is very positive.

00:34:57.262 --> 00:34:57.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Yes.

00:34:57.963 --> 00:34:59.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: And so

00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:01.867 align:middle line:84%
that helps reenforce
our positive energy.

00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:02.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Beautiful.

00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:04.603 align:middle line:84%
This was very much a
delicious interview.

00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:06.271 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Jackie.

00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:08.941 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: Lilou, thank
you so much, this was great fun.

00:35:08.941 --> 00:35:12.411 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for really
enjoying my garden with me

00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:14.813 align:middle line:90%
and for allowing me to share.

00:35:14.813 --> 00:35:15.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: And the roses.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:16.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Jackie Lapin: Oh, yes.

00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:18.083 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou Mace: The
love of your life.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:19.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Jackie Lapin: We'll
bring a few for you.

00:35:19.518 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou Mace: Thank you.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.788 align:middle line:90%
Much much love.

00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:25.090 align:middle line:84%
My delicious creators this was
another beautiful interview

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.192 align:middle line:90%
for GTV.

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.
