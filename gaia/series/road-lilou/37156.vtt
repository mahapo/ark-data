[ Music ]

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.051 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road again, and
I'm delighted to be sharing

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:19.186 align:middle line:84%
with you this amazing
conversation.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.322 align:middle line:84%
I know it's going to be
very juicy and it's going

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.456 align:middle line:90%
to make a lot of sense.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:24.024 align:middle line:84%
It's going to help you
make sense, actually,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.259 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on right now.

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.495 align:middle line:90%
It's about astrology.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.564 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting next to Tom, that
is really the specialist.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:34.034 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are putting so
many videos out on YouTube.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.569 align:middle line:84%
You spend a lot of
time in Kauai --

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.771 align:middle line:90%
no, not in Kauai, on Big Island.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:42.543 align:middle line:84%
But certainly this very
powerful Pele energy, you know,

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.011 align:middle line:84%
that you feel and
that you're able

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:45.312 align:middle line:90%
to share through those videos.

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:46.547 align:middle line:90%
So here, it's actually an honor,

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:49.383 align:middle line:84%
to be interviewing
you in San Francisco.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:52.119 align:middle line:84%
We're here near the
Fisherman's Wharf, I guess.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.322 align:middle line:84%
And the Golden Gate Bridge is
over there, but unfortunately,

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:59.226 align:middle line:84%
under those clouds, but it
seems to be nicer and nicer

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:02.796 align:middle line:84%
and just keep on opening up --
as this conversation is going

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.066 align:middle line:84%
to do for people listening to
it -- fully, until the end.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.268 align:middle line:90%
Dzzz [phonetic]!

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:12.072 align:middle line:84%
So, Tom, it feels like a
lot is going on right now.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.075 align:middle line:84%
And these are big
transitions in the world.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.645 align:middle line:84%
Now, could you paint a
little bit of that picture,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:21.782 align:middle line:84%
of what we just went through,
since the 21st of December 2012?

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:25.186 align:middle line:84%
Are things really
accelerating and they going

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:90%
to open up and lighten up?

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.524 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:31.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Tom Kaypacha Lescher: Wow.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.165 align:middle line:84%
You know, opening up
and lightening up, is --

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:41.001 align:middle line:84%
it's a very interesting
way of looking at it.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.873 align:middle line:84%
And I will say that, it will,
for some; and not for all.

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:48.275 align:middle line:84%
And they can say, "The
brighter the light,

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.643 align:middle line:90%
the darker the shadow."

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:55.015 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of different ways
of dealing with and looking

00:01:55.015 --> 00:02:01.088 align:middle line:84%
at our life and our planet and
human consciousness right now.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:04.491 align:middle line:84%
And it's going through
a major shift.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:11.966 align:middle line:84%
And those who are awake and
willing and take up the,

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:17.004 align:middle line:84%
you know, the banner or the
song, then they're going

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:84%
to experience this sun
coming out [Laughs]

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:24.645 align:middle line:84%
and the light will -- yeah
-- and the light will shine.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:27.314 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just, like
I say, we're coming more

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.984 align:middle line:90%
into a time of self-empowerment

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:33.153 align:middle line:84%
where we create our
own realities.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
And this process of creation
is an active process.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.464 align:middle line:84%
If you do not participate
in the act

00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:46.433 align:middle line:90%
of creating -- it is a choice.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.735 align:middle line:90%
It is a decision.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.703 align:middle line:90%
"I am not going to create."

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:56.977 align:middle line:84%
If you don't take up this active
creation and it's creating you,

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, then you are becoming
powerless and your worst fears

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and your worst nightmares
and your victim consciousness

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.623 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
going to overwhelm you,

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and you will feel
the dark and go in,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.096 align:middle line:84%
down the downward
spiral of despair.

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs] Yeah.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.568 align:middle line:90%
Or you can engage.

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:26.874 align:middle line:84%
And you engage now, and with
your thoughts, with your ideas,

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
with your intentions,
with your willpower

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.817 align:middle line:84%
and your determination,
you then can experience --

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:38.485 align:middle line:84%
like we were just
talking about before --

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:45.492 align:middle line:84%
this mutable quality of reality,
that reality is loosening.

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:46.493 align:middle line:90%
It's opening.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:48.262 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more
like silly putty.

00:03:48.262 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] It's more
like, you know,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:90%
clay with lots of water in it.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.568 align:middle line:90%
It's not as hard and fixed

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.504 align:middle line:84%
as we've been told,
as we've been taught.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.441 align:middle line:84%
And the actual nature -- I'm
sure science is, you know,

00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:01.742 align:middle line:90%
coming into this, you know,

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:06.213 align:middle line:84%
this nature of reality is
more -- yeah -- changeable.

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So, we have more
power, more authority,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
more control than we used to.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: On an astrological
perspective, what are some

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.793 align:middle line:84%
of the alignments that have been
-- what happened on the 21st?

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.796 align:middle line:84%
Let's summarize, with your
point of view, what happened

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.366 align:middle line:90%
on the 21st of December 2012?

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:29.003 align:middle line:84%
And what 2013 --
even 2013 is about?

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Okay, yes.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.642 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, 2012, December
21st, this was the time

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:39.813 align:middle line:84%
where that winter solstice
point was in alignment

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:41.949 align:middle line:90%
with the galactic center.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And this galactic center is
shifting every 26,000 years.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.661 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand it
indicates a turning point,

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:59.867 align:middle line:84%
and if you're going to
turn a 26,000-year cycle,

00:04:59.867 --> 00:05:02.503 align:middle line:84%
give yourself 500
years, alright?

00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:03.637 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs]

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:08.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Don't expect
it to happen right now.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:11.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: [Laughs] Let's
take it easy on ourselves, man.

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:13.447 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] You know, things
happen fast, in large,

00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:15.382 align:middle line:90%
large, large cycles, yeah?

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:18.185 align:middle line:84%
We're shifting from the
age of Pisces to Aquarius.

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.454 align:middle line:90%
That's a 2,000-year cycle.

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:24.291 align:middle line:84%
We've got to give ourselves
100 years to make that change.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.528 align:middle line:90%
I say from 1950 to 2050.

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:31.665 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? So, you know, we come
into this turning point,

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and I see this turning point
as a rebalancing of the Yin

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.573 align:middle line:84%
and the Yang; the
light and the dark;

00:05:39.573 --> 00:05:42.041 align:middle line:90%
the masculine and the feminine.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And we had 6,500
years of patriarchy.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.484 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, 6,500
years of matriarchy.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:52.419 align:middle line:90%
Because that's 13,000 years.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.057 align:middle line:84%
This is half of that
26,000-year cycle.

00:05:57.057 --> 00:06:02.129 align:middle line:90%
So these are huge -- yeah.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:06.033 align:middle line:90%
You know, this awareness,

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:12.105 align:middle line:84%
the way that we have integrated
what we understand this to be --

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.575 align:middle line:84%
the Yin and the Yang; the
masculine and the feminine --

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle line:84%
and how they dance
together, integrate together;

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:25.152 align:middle line:84%
versus control; dominate;
suppress; withhold.

00:06:25.152 --> 00:06:26.353 align:middle line:90%
All --

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: With or without,
but not coming together.

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:29.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yes.

00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:32.192 align:middle line:84%
So, we could say in some
ways, the matriarchy,

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:36.997 align:middle line:84%
the pendulum swung to the
feminine; and in the patriarchy,

00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:39.666 align:middle line:90%
it swung over to the masculine.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:90%
And we're now coming back.

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:47.908 align:middle line:84%
And this rebalancing is
a time for men and women

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.377 align:middle line:90%
to really be cooperating,

00:06:50.377 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
working together
in a different way.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.117 align:middle line:84%
Our sexuality, to be being
expressed and utilized

00:06:57.117 --> 00:07:00.654 align:middle line:84%
and experienced in a
whole new, different way.

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:05.859 align:middle line:84%
The whole way that our,
like I say, our chakras --

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle line:84%
the masculine is the
upper three chakras --

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.632 align:middle line:84%
the light, the above,
the out and beyond.

00:07:11.632 --> 00:07:15.569 align:middle line:84%
The feminine is the lower three
chakras -- the inner, the dark,

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:21.041 align:middle line:84%
the chaotic, feminine force,
yes, which is creative and yeah.

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:21.742 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:21.742 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And love, too.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: And love.

00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:27.514 align:middle line:84%
Here you got -- love is the
heart -- is right in the middle.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:28.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's
where they both meet.

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: When
they come together,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.385 align:middle line:90%
then you've got the heart, yeah.

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:32.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's interesting
that you say

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.256 align:middle line:84%
that this is the masculine
side, because of the intuition.

00:07:36.256 --> 00:07:40.327 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we have to see the
intuition with this area, no?

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: Intuition is
an interesting thing, yes.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:46.199 align:middle line:84%
There's different kinds
of intuition, right?

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.836 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at
left and right brain, okay?

00:07:49.836 --> 00:07:54.775 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the right brain is
our intuitive side, okay?

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:59.012 align:middle line:84%
There's another kind
of intuition that is,

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:02.182 align:middle line:90%
"My gut just tells me."

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.216 align:middle line:90%
[Laugh] Yeah?

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:05.819 align:middle line:84%
We would say this is
another intuition.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:09.656 align:middle line:84%
It's more of an instinctual
intuition.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:14.695 align:middle line:84%
So, there's different forms
of intuition that we could,

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:17.965 align:middle line:84%
you know, refine
exactly what that is.

00:08:17.965 --> 00:08:21.301 align:middle line:84%
So, there is this,
"the third eye."

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:24.404 align:middle line:84%
It's Aquarius; it's
Uranus, in astrology.

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:90%
This third eye is the future.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.677 align:middle line:84%
It's the envisioning, the
science, the technology,

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:35.215 align:middle line:84%
the invention, the prophet
that sees into the future.

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:37.851 align:middle line:90%
This is a form of intuition.

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.688 align:middle line:90%
Then, there is the feeling.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:42.756 align:middle line:90%
"I just know.

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.491 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I know.

00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:47.027 align:middle line:90%
I feel. I'm sensing.

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm picking up.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:55.302 align:middle line:84%
I'm receiving signals from my
environment, from you that,

00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle line:84%
you know, give me
this inner sensation."

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
This is another form
of intuition.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.014 align:middle line:84%
Are there some, like,
because we just spoke

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:08.248 align:middle line:90%
in general, right now.

00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
Well, 2012, 2013, '14 --
but is there some specific,

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
like three months, six months,
a year cycle of some alignment

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.927 align:middle line:84%
of some planets that we're
coming in the next month,

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:24.197 align:middle line:84%
throughout the end
of 2013 or...?

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:27.968 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: We're coming into
-- there is a bit of a pinnacle.

00:09:27.968 --> 00:09:30.103 align:middle line:90%
We're coming into a point here

00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
in September that's
very powerful.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Last October, the north
node of the moon goes

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.681 align:middle line:90%
around every 18.6 years.

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:45.819 align:middle line:84%
Okay? So, you know, at 18 --
and the moon's node has to do

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:50.991 align:middle line:84%
with your future destiny on
an unconscious, soul level.

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And the north node
is the future.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.329 align:middle line:84%
The south node is
your past lives,

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.166 align:middle line:84%
because your soul has gone
through many lifetimes.

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:01.334 align:middle line:90%
So, the north node

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:05.005 align:middle line:90%
moved into Scorpio in October.

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:10.977 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn goes around
every 28 to 29 years.

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:15.115 align:middle line:84%
It cuts the human lifespan
into three, pretty much, yeah?

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:18.118 align:middle line:84%
It is also -- it
came into Scorpio

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:23.156 align:middle line:84%
from the other side,
okay, in October.

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:26.593 align:middle line:84%
And so, these two
are coming across --

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.695 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's going to
be moving forward.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:30.063 align:middle line:90%
The node moves backward.

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:34.334 align:middle line:84%
They're meeting right in
the middle of Scorpio, yes,

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.604 align:middle line:84%
around 10, 11 degrees
of Scorpio.

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:40.741 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
to pass and continue on.

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:44.044 align:middle line:90%
But this energy of Scorpio --

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:45.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, what is Scorpio?

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:47.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Shiva.

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:49.416 align:middle line:90%
Death. Kali.

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.953 align:middle line:90%
Durga. It is destruction.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:58.158 align:middle line:84%
It is the removal of anything
in the way of our evolution.

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:04.064 align:middle line:84%
It is confronting
and ideally merging,

00:11:04.064 --> 00:11:08.602 align:middle line:84%
uniting with forces
beyond our control.

00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:10.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Good forces?

00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:12.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: It's the
house -- it's sex.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:14.508 align:middle line:90%
This is union.

00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:17.477 align:middle line:84%
There's a creation
that comes out of it,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:20.347 align:middle line:84%
and we take on the
other person's karma.

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:25.652 align:middle line:84%
We merge and unite and
we evolve through union.

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.454 align:middle line:90%
This is Scorpio.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:28.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It sounds
like twin flame.

00:11:28.655 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Even -- yes.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.493 align:middle line:84%
This is -- and so many
people are now looking.

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:84%
It's like, "I know he
or she is out there."

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.098 align:middle line:90%
This is -- yeah?

00:11:38.098 --> 00:11:40.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: A lot of people
are meeting their twin flame.

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:42.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: This is the time.

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:48.108 align:middle line:84%
This is -- Saturn is
contracts, commitment.

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.242 align:middle line:90%
It's maturity.

00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:50.544 align:middle line:90%
It's the elder.

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:55.182 align:middle line:84%
It's a willingness to, you
know, really, yes, be here.

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:58.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: To make things happen,
to materialize it on Earth

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.387 align:middle line:90%
for this evolution, no?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yes.

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:06.693 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Now, Saturn --
Saturn is Saturn, I mean...

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:08.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Fill us about Saturn.

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:09.529 align:middle line:90%
Can I introduce Saturn?

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:10.664 align:middle line:90%
Saturn, come on.

00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:11.698 align:middle line:90%
Bring on Saturn.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Channel Saturn, right
now, please.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.468 align:middle line:90%
Please? Pop-pop-pop.

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:18.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: This is the
guardian of the threshold.

00:12:18.672 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You must prove yourself worthy,
mature enough, old enough,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.712 align:middle line:84%
wise enough, with
enough character,

00:12:25.712 --> 00:12:28.849 align:middle line:84%
with enough willpower,
with enough objectivity,

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:90%
with enough responsibility.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.819 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is duty.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:35.055 align:middle line:90%
We have a duty to each other.

00:12:35.055 --> 00:12:36.423 align:middle line:90%
So, this is also a time

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.326 align:middle line:84%
when people are confronting
and facing.

00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:41.828 align:middle line:84%
And their partners are
coming to them, going,

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.065 align:middle line:84%
"You said you would,"
and "You agreed to,"

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:47.334 align:middle line:84%
and "This is the
contract you signed."

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:49.436 align:middle line:90%
And, you know.

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So, we're also being, you
know, we're being faced.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.875 align:middle line:90%
We're being tested.

00:12:54.875 --> 00:12:56.243 align:middle line:90%
We're being challenged.

00:12:56.243 --> 00:13:02.449 align:middle line:84%
We're being, you know, called
to task, to be in integrity

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and to hold to what
we have said, yeah?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.156 align:middle line:84%
And if it's time to make
a change, this is a time.

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:12.125 align:middle line:90%
So, this is the time where --

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: This is a
gateway to there, huh?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: It's -- yes.

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you're with your
twin flame/soul mate, boom!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.069 align:middle line:90%
It's going to, like, cement.

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:28.441 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not, you're going
to bump up and hit and run

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.312 align:middle line:84%
into every obstacle,
problem and limitation.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:38.818 align:middle line:84%
And so, there are also
relationships breaking apart,

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:40.954 align:middle line:90%
that have been.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:46.493 align:middle line:84%
Saturn has to do with
7, 14, 21, 28 years.

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:52.332 align:middle line:84%
It's time to review,
re-contract, you know,

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:56.603 align:middle line:90%
renegotiate, recommit or not.

00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:59.372 align:middle line:90%
But it is a turning point.

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:01.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I'm guessing
we're in this, right now,

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:02.809 align:middle line:84%
because as we're
recording this video,

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.244 align:middle line:90%
we're actually in mid-July.

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:07.147 align:middle line:84%
This video goes online a
bit later, because there's

00:14:07.147 --> 00:14:09.983 align:middle line:84%
so much great, juicy content
coming up and I am the,

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:12.752 align:middle line:84%
you know, as every week, there
is new videos on the show,

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:15.956 align:middle line:84%
as you can see, that
are scheduled, new ones.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:18.992 align:middle line:84%
So, this is -- but, so we're
already before or after?

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.794 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you said,
for the big transition,

00:14:20.794 --> 00:14:22.195 align:middle line:90%
I guess is the same here.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:27.233 align:middle line:84%
It starts gradually and it picks
up in September and then --

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:29.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: It continues
on, particularly

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:31.938 align:middle line:90%
through next March and April.

00:14:31.938 --> 00:14:35.642 align:middle line:84%
The moon's node will then
be finished with Scorpio

00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:37.644 align:middle line:84%
and be moving into
Libra [laughs],

00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:40.046 align:middle line:84%
the sign of partnership
and relationship.

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:41.581 align:middle line:90%
But it's on a different level.

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:44.918 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Scorpio is a water sign.

00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:47.287 align:middle line:84%
It's deep, passionate,
Kundalini,

00:14:47.287 --> 00:14:49.956 align:middle line:90%
snake, scorpion, energy.

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:50.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Great sex!

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yeah.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:55.628 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] Yeah, we
can go into that.

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:59.332 align:middle line:84%
That would probably
be another show.

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs].

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Two will be about
sexual energy, healing, healing.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.071 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: Talk about
juicy; it's a water sign.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:08.775 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] But it's
-- actually Saturn

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:12.412 align:middle line:90%
in Scorpio is not so juicy.

00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:18.618 align:middle line:84%
Saturn comes in and brings
objectivity and maturity,

00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and what are the
long range effects

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.189 align:middle line:90%
of this sex that we're having?

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And should I really
engage on that level?

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.462 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of judgment.

00:15:29.462 --> 00:15:31.264 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of caution.

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:35.635 align:middle line:84%
Saturn in Scorpio is
usually like, "No."

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:38.838 align:middle line:90%
Saturn says, "No, it's not time.

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:40.473 align:middle line:90%
This is not the right way.

00:15:40.473 --> 00:15:42.475 align:middle line:90%
You are not the right person."

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:45.378 align:middle line:90%
This has to be -- you know,

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:49.416 align:middle line:84%
it's very much having
to do with the law.

00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:52.085 align:middle line:84%
And there are laws,
and there are times

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.454 align:middle line:90%
and seasons for everything.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:57.223 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn brings this
in, so it's actually --

00:15:57.223 --> 00:15:58.558 align:middle line:90%
I would say this is a time

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:01.394 align:middle line:84%
where there's probably
less sex going on.

00:16:01.394 --> 00:16:04.831 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] I hate to
say it, you know?

00:16:04.831 --> 00:16:07.634 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, yeah,
this is really a time

00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:09.969 align:middle line:84%
where people are
much more cautious.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.907 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of,
you know, tentative.

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:15.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: This is --
we're talking September?

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:16.609 align:middle line:84%
March? Or where are
we right now?

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:17.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: We're
talking from --

00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is in Scorpio from
October of '12 through,

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:25.585 align:middle line:90%
yes, the spring of '15.

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:28.221 align:middle line:90%
Yeah? So, it's another -- sorry.

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:28.855 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs]

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: No, no.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.392 align:middle line:84%
So, I guess it's really
very important to be clear,

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:36.196 align:middle line:84%
to be clear and to know and to
continue to follow the intuition

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and to follow what we have in
there, in this compass, inside.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.102 align:middle line:90%
Besides -- because it seems

00:16:42.102 --> 00:16:45.371 align:middle line:84%
like there's this
confrontation, you know?

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.407 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain way
and there's those rules

00:16:47.407 --> 00:16:49.642 align:middle line:84%
and this is how it's
supposed to go,

00:16:49.642 --> 00:16:52.312 align:middle line:84%
and you can't break this
contract, and how can you?

00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:53.246 align:middle line:90%
And you have to stay center.

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:54.981 align:middle line:90%
Center, center, center.

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:56.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: I'll tell
you, and the other part

00:16:56.549 --> 00:17:01.754 align:middle line:84%
of that center is, Saturn
is external authority.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in Scorpio,
it's other people's power,

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:08.895 align:middle line:84%
other people's money,
other people's passion.

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:11.764 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at the
rest of the astrology --

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:16.136 align:middle line:84%
Pluto and Capricorn; Uranus
and Aries; Jupiter going

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:20.005 align:middle line:84%
through Cancer now -- all of
these are going on for a number

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:23.176 align:middle line:84%
of years, except
Jupiter is only one year.

00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:28.915 align:middle line:84%
But they all have to do
with this breaking free,

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:34.988 align:middle line:84%
this breaking out of being
directed, being channeled,

00:17:34.988 --> 00:17:38.758 align:middle line:84%
being railroaded,
being told, being --

00:17:38.758 --> 00:17:42.028 align:middle line:90%
yes, you know, dominated.

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:48.268 align:middle line:84%
This whole patriarchal religion,
government, teachers, education,

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:55.708 align:middle line:84%
medicine -- it's all been
disempowering the individual

00:17:55.708 --> 00:18:01.014 align:middle line:84%
in favor of the clan,
the society,

00:18:01.014 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:90%
the business, the corporation.

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:07.353 align:middle line:84%
This is a time of individuals
reclaiming their power.

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And this Scorpio is
other people's power.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.027 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn there is --
there's going to just be a lot

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:18.565 align:middle line:84%
of pushy people, trying
to tell us what's right,

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.567 align:middle line:84%
tell us what's wrong,
tell us what to do,

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.136 align:middle line:84%
tell us who to be with,
tell us how to live...

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's up each one
of us, like we started

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.943 align:middle line:84%
out with this creating
your own reality.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:35.415 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is stepping up and
each one of us becoming Saturn

00:18:35.415 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:90%
in Scorpio, which is, "I say no.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.122 align:middle line:90%
I have a healthy boundary.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.625 align:middle line:90%
I have an immune system."

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:84%
Our immune systems are
getting attacked right now.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:52.232 align:middle line:84%
Yes? And this is not
just on a physical level.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:56.469 align:middle line:84%
This is on emotional, mental,
spiritual -- all of our levels.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.739 align:middle line:84%
We're coming into this
Neptune in Pisces.

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:05.979 align:middle line:84%
And this is a time to really
become more clear of, you know,

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:12.318 align:middle line:84%
our boundaries; of our limits;
of our capacities; to, you know,

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:17.123 align:middle line:84%
to create -- yeah --
what is really needed;

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:22.395 align:middle line:84%
what is really expressive
of our truth,

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:84%
rather than what my
mother would have created;

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:29.936 align:middle line:84%
our grandfather really wanted;
my, you know, my teacher

00:19:29.936 --> 00:19:35.041 align:middle line:84%
or Obama, or yeah, some other
external authority has been

00:19:35.041 --> 00:19:36.175 align:middle line:90%
telling us.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.444 align:middle line:84%
It's about -- it's
time to diversify.

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:40.513 align:middle line:90%
This is the age of Aquarius.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.682 align:middle line:84%
We're coming into
this age of Aquarius

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:47.253 align:middle line:84%
and diversification
is individualization,

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:84%
which is unique, bizarre,
unusual, stepping --

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Within the oneness.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.661 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Within the oneness.

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:57.463 align:middle line:84%
It's like the universe
is expanding,

00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:01.301 align:middle line:90%
physically and on every level.

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:07.507 align:middle line:84%
So, it's time to allow and
except and open, you know,

00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:16.582 align:middle line:84%
to the crazy, the chaotic, the
unexplainable, the goofy, the --

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.354 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like,
allow everything its place

00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:24.991 align:middle line:90%
and time to exist, to express.

00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:26.592 align:middle line:90%
Stop putting these walls

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:84%
and these limitations
and these judgments.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:33.933 align:middle line:84%
You know, in this heaven
and hell kind of, polarized,

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.636 align:middle line:84%
good/bad type of
label on everything.

00:20:36.636 --> 00:20:40.773 align:middle line:84%
We're opening beyond
third dimension,

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:44.744 align:middle line:84%
beyond this polarity,
beyond good or bad.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:46.379 align:middle line:90%
It's not good or bad.

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:49.015 align:middle line:90%
It is. It just is.

00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:51.017 align:middle line:90%
And you just are you.

00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:52.952 align:middle line:90%
And I just am I.

00:20:52.952 --> 00:20:57.357 align:middle line:84%
And we can all live
together, when we stop trying

00:20:57.357 --> 00:21:02.295 align:middle line:84%
to make each other into
something that they're not.

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:08.968 align:middle line:84%
But actually appreciate how
diverse, how crazy, how insane;

00:21:08.968 --> 00:21:10.236 align:middle line:90%
everybody else really is.

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:11.537 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs]

00:21:11.537 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, it's really
relaxing and breathing, huh?

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.543 align:middle line:84%
And moving the body, and
you talk about dancing, too.

00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:19.712 align:middle line:84%
And it's about time
to get in there, huh?

00:21:19.712 --> 00:21:20.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yes.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:23.983 align:middle line:84%
And there's been so
much, you know, again --

00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:26.085 align:middle line:90%
cultural conditioning.

00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Dress like this.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.887 align:middle line:90%
Dance like --

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:28.554 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I'm undressing.

00:21:28.554 --> 00:21:29.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: -- this.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.523 align:middle line:90%
Walk like this.

00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:32.825 align:middle line:84%
You know? It's like, you know,
we don't talk about that here

00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:35.928 align:middle line:84%
and we don't act like that, and
we don't wear this here and,

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:38.531 align:middle line:90%
you know, these things -- yeah.

00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, the norms; the
customs; you know, the dogmas,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.838 align:middle line:90%
you know, are breaking down.

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:50.309 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing a lot of
fear, a lot of anxiety,

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:55.982 align:middle line:84%
for those who have
relied on -- you know?

00:21:55.982 --> 00:22:00.386 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that, you know,
that job was my security.

00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:02.789 align:middle line:90%
Here's where security comes in.

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:05.191 align:middle line:90%
You know? Which is an illusion.

00:22:05.191 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as security.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:13.166 align:middle line:84%
There's -- so it's kind
of this impossible dream

00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.435 align:middle line:90%
that people are chasing.

00:22:15.435 --> 00:22:19.038 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? And if they just
come through to this place

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:24.477 align:middle line:84%
of accepting that they don't
need to be secure, that --

00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:29.115 align:middle line:84%
you know, life; Gaia;
Mother; Nature --

00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:90%
there is security in change.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.519 align:middle line:90%
If you want security, change.

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:38.858 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] And then you are
participating in nature,

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:46.466 align:middle line:84%
in the unfoldment and you will,
you know, you will blossom.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:50.903 align:middle line:84%
And you will die, just like
the seeds and just like --

00:22:50.903 --> 00:22:55.374 align:middle line:84%
and it's -- you know, resistance
is just the cause of a lot

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.609 align:middle line:90%
of pain and suffering.

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.481 align:middle line:84%
So, really, relaxing, accepting
what's going on and rebirthing,

00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.616 align:middle line:84%
huh, out of those,
like the phoenix?

00:23:03.616 --> 00:23:05.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: It's
absolutely, so much --

00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:07.353 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so much has
changed in my life,

00:23:07.353 --> 00:23:13.626 align:middle line:84%
since I embraced the motto
of "Surrender to Life."

00:23:13.626 --> 00:23:15.761 align:middle line:90%
Life has wisdom.

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is infinite in its
intelligence and it speaks to us

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.535 align:middle line:84%
through the flowers,
through you,

00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:24.871 align:middle line:84%
through each other,
through nature.

00:23:24.871 --> 00:23:28.808 align:middle line:84%
And it's listening
and surrendering.

00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:31.878 align:middle line:84%
The light is red;
don't go there.

00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:32.445 align:middle line:90%
You know? [Laughs]

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:33.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Duh!

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
The light is red, yes!

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Wait for the green light!

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.484 align:middle line:90%
Just patience.

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:40.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: This
person doesn't like you.

00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:42.021 align:middle line:90%
Well, go away.

00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:45.458 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
you're dumb, ignorant,

00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:90%
less than, wrong, whatever.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.695 align:middle line:84%
It's just that, that
person and you,

00:23:49.695 --> 00:23:52.565 align:middle line:84%
your magnetic fields
are not in harmony

00:23:52.565 --> 00:23:54.367 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
time in your life.

00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:59.305 align:middle line:84%
I mean, don't place
all this, you know --

00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:00.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's heavy, otherwise.

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:01.574 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yeah.

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:06.045 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. That's the opportunity to
be lightening up so much now,

00:24:06.045 --> 00:24:08.714 align:middle line:84%
is to just, you know,
be flowing;

00:24:08.714 --> 00:24:11.551 align:middle line:90%
listening; dancing; yes?

00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:14.086 align:middle line:84%
Much more so than
the patriarchy.

00:24:14.086 --> 00:24:19.292 align:middle line:84%
The past was about, "Adam,
name all the animals."

00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:24.497 align:middle line:84%
You know? And, "Multiply and,
you know, dominate the earth."

00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:27.733 align:middle line:84%
It's been about control,
domination.

00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:28.868 align:middle line:90%
In fact --

00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:30.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I just
interviewed, actually yesterday,

00:24:30.236 --> 00:24:33.105 align:middle line:84%
Foster Gamble, so this is the
video just before this one.

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.574 align:middle line:84%
You know, that did
the movie, "Thrive"?

00:24:34.574 --> 00:24:35.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yeah.

00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:36.709 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah. I love it, man.

00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:37.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, you're right --
you're right after this one.

00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.513 align:middle line:84%
So, it's perfect, talking
of control and domination.

00:24:40.513 --> 00:24:41.881 align:middle line:90%
We went over it.

00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:43.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:43.316 --> 00:24:46.085 align:middle line:84%
It's been all about
-- if you're strong --

00:24:46.085 --> 00:24:50.256 align:middle line:84%
like a measure of strength
is how much you are able

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:54.927 align:middle line:90%
to resist nature.

00:24:54.927 --> 00:25:00.266 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] And you know, and if
you are weak, like changing,

00:25:00.266 --> 00:25:05.438 align:middle line:84%
flowing, you know, leaving
an unpleasant job and going

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:08.574 align:middle line:84%
onto something else, yeah,
this has like been --

00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:11.577 align:middle line:84%
so, you know, change has
been seen as a weakness.

00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:14.046 align:middle line:84%
This is just like
a completely --

00:25:14.046 --> 00:25:17.049 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the paradigm
shift would be, that,

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:21.387 align:middle line:84%
you know what, listen;
surrender; feel --

00:25:21.387 --> 00:25:26.993 align:middle line:84%
into the feminine; into the
mother; into Gaia; into nature

00:25:26.993 --> 00:25:30.196 align:middle line:90%
and flow, and let it go.

00:25:30.196 --> 00:25:35.134 align:middle line:84%
All of this letting go is --
Scorpio is -- that's Shiva.

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:43.442 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge planetary time
of really letting go of so much.

00:25:43.442 --> 00:25:50.583 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to --
there's no end to letting go.

00:25:50.583 --> 00:25:53.919 align:middle line:84%
Like people say, "Oh,
well, I let go of my job

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.689 align:middle line:90%
and my house and my spouse..."

00:25:56.689 --> 00:25:57.857 align:middle line:90%
and, you know?

00:25:57.857 --> 00:25:58.924 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:02.395 align:middle line:90%
It's letting go of attitudes.

00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:04.363 align:middle line:90%
It's letting go of fears.

00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:06.932 align:middle line:90%
It's letting go of, you know --

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beliefs and --

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Beliefs.

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:12.471 align:middle line:90%
You know? It's just like, yeah.

00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:14.573 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every belief
is a filter.

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.542 align:middle line:90%
My one teacher said, you know,

00:26:16.542 --> 00:26:21.647 align:middle line:84%
that enlightenment is
not believing anything.

00:26:21.647 --> 00:26:23.549 align:middle line:90%
It takes you out of the "now."

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It's out of the present moment.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.319 align:middle line:90%
Because you're filtering it

00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:29.588 align:middle line:84%
through your belief
and judging it.

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.858 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, letting go,
it's like there's --

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:37.129 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how much
you can let go of.

00:26:37.129 --> 00:26:38.364 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:26:38.364 --> 00:26:39.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Do we let go --

00:26:39.532 --> 00:26:42.368 align:middle line:84%
can Gaia help us
with this letting go?

00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:45.771 align:middle line:84%
Can we actually call
for her to be there?

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:51.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: You know, it's
witnessing, witnessing nature,

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:56.649 align:middle line:84%
witnessing -- you can say
that, you know, nature is cruel

00:26:56.649 --> 00:27:02.354 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, because it upsets
so many of our human plans.

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.589 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs] You know?

00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:07.993 align:middle line:84%
Like today, we wanted a
sunny day for our interview.

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:09.328 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs]

00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We wanted to see
the Golden Gate, but actually,

00:27:11.163 --> 00:27:14.033 align:middle line:84%
we just shifted camera angles
because the Golden Gate is,

00:27:14.033 --> 00:27:16.168 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, it's
under the clouds.

00:27:16.168 --> 00:27:19.739 align:middle line:90%
But now the sun is out.

00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yeah.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.176 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So, this letting go
-- if you watch nature,

00:27:24.176 --> 00:27:27.546 align:middle line:84%
if you watch the animals,
you watch the fish, you know,

00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:30.082 align:middle line:84%
you watch the snakes
shed their skin,

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:33.419 align:middle line:84%
you watch the fruit
drop off of the trees,

00:27:33.419 --> 00:27:37.156 align:middle line:84%
you watch the trees
fall down themselves.

00:27:37.156 --> 00:27:41.894 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? And, I mean, you see
this letting go on every level.

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:45.197 align:middle line:90%
And it's just -- it's a teacher.

00:27:45.197 --> 00:27:46.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How about Pele?

00:27:46.232 --> 00:27:47.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yeah.

00:27:47.066 --> 00:27:47.933 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Is He a teacher, huh?

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:49.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Oh my goodness.

00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:53.672 align:middle line:84%
Pele is bringing up -- yes,
the Goddess of the Volcano,

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:57.843 align:middle line:84%
from the core of the earth,
which is like your root chakra.

00:27:57.843 --> 00:28:00.813 align:middle line:84%
It's your Kundalini
snake energy.

00:28:00.813 --> 00:28:05.518 align:middle line:84%
She's bringing it up to the
surface, and you know what?

00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:10.956 align:middle line:84%
The Big Island of Hawaii expands
a square mile every year.

00:28:10.956 --> 00:28:12.625 align:middle line:90%
Yeah? It's growing.

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:13.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Great.

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:13.926 align:middle line:90%
It's going to reach France.

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:15.628 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:28:15.628 --> 00:28:17.963 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: [Laughs] And there's
another island coming up,

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:19.632 align:middle line:90%
just off the coast.

00:28:19.632 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.604 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So, it's going to be
1,000 years before it hits

00:28:25.604 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:90%
the surface.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:27.706 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs] She goes pretty slow.

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:31.577 align:middle line:84%
That's the other thing
Gaia can teach us [laughs]:

00:28:31.577 --> 00:28:34.580 align:middle line:90%
chill out and slow down.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.183 align:middle line:84%
It's like, where do
you think you're going?

00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:40.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You have an eternity.

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: [Laughs] Yeah.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.289 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's -- where do
you think you're going?

00:28:43.289 --> 00:28:44.557 align:middle line:90%
What are you chasing?

00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:47.793 align:middle line:84%
What are you -- you know,
it's like joy, happiness,

00:28:47.793 --> 00:28:52.331 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, is like, you
know, I'm feeling it right now.

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:53.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Me, too.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: This is great.

00:28:54.967 --> 00:28:57.837 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] Sitting here on
a wall, talking, you know?

00:28:57.837 --> 00:28:58.871 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:28:58.871 --> 00:28:59.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: With the water.

00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:00.773 align:middle line:90%
On support, on the water.

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:01.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher.

00:29:01.273 --> 00:29:02.107 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:29:02.107 --> 00:29:03.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Different elements.

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:04.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: Oh, my
God, the water.

00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:06.879 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:09.481 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, astrology is the
fire, earth, air and water.

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:13.085 align:middle line:84%
And you see each one of these
in their different, you know,

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:15.721 align:middle line:90%
manifestations, in their glory.

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:19.592 align:middle line:84%
And there is -- there's this
time and the seasons are,

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:90%
you know -- four seasons.

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:24.897 align:middle line:84%
You've got all these
different, you know, teachers.

00:29:24.897 --> 00:29:30.236 align:middle line:84%
Nature is just such this, you
know, amazing, amazing teacher.

00:29:30.236 --> 00:29:31.237 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:31.237 --> 00:29:32.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, now,
it's time to flow.

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's time to, as the
water would, you know?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.709 align:middle line:90%
Just dance with it all, huh?

00:29:36.709 --> 00:29:38.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Yes, it is.

00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:39.311 align:middle line:90%
It's --

00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:41.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Letting go,
wash away, wash out.

00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:43.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: Jupiter is
in the sign of Cancer.

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It went into the sign of Cancer,

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:50.122 align:middle line:84%
which is water, yes,
in June of 2013.

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:53.826 align:middle line:84%
It's going to stay there
until June of 2014.

00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:58.464 align:middle line:84%
And Jupiter is expansion,
opening.

00:29:58.464 --> 00:30:00.633 align:middle line:84%
It's the fast track
of evolution.

00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:84%
If you want to evolve,
do Jupiter.

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:07.373 align:middle line:84%
So, Jupiter's in Cancer, now,
for a year and what's Cancer?

00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:09.675 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is the womb.

00:30:09.675 --> 00:30:10.976 align:middle line:90%
It's the baby.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.678 align:middle line:90%
It's my inner child.

00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:14.079 align:middle line:90%
It's the "I want."

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:15.981 align:middle line:90%
It's my feelings.

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:17.783 align:middle line:90%
It's... yeah.

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:18.584 align:middle line:90%
So, it is.

00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:20.052 align:middle line:90%
It's this watery element.

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:20.819 align:middle line:90%
It's crying.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:21.754 align:middle line:90%
It's tears.

00:30:21.754 --> 00:30:25.324 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling all
of those feelings,

00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:30.763 align:middle line:84%
instead of controlling;
waiting; channeling; directing.

00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just feel your feelings.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.003 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel that
feeling, it changes.

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.838 align:middle line:90%
And it goes away.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.275 align:middle line:84%
If you try not to feel
it or you hold it back,

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:47.179 align:middle line:84%
that's when it gets
distorted; perverted;

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:90%
weirded-out; and causes upset.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.322 align:middle line:84%
Yeah? So, water is just
this, this flowing; moving;

00:30:56.322 --> 00:31:00.559 align:middle line:84%
changing element now, that
the more we are around it;

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:05.831 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by it; in it;
feeling it; drinking it; yeah --

00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, standing
out in a nice,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.171 align:middle line:90%
tropical rain -- I mean, yeah.

00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:15.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Last little word
you want to leave us with?

00:31:15.074 --> 00:31:17.943 align:middle line:84%
Something -- a message,
an inspiration?

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:19.011 align:middle line:90%
>> Lescher: Well, I --

00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There was
a lot in this video.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.016 align:middle line:84%
But just like your last
thing, if your intuition feels

00:31:24.016 --> 00:31:26.852 align:middle line:84%
like it's so important to tell
this to the Gaiam community --

00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Lescher: You know, Cancer is
also about family -- familia.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.458 align:middle line:90%
I just moved down to Costa Rica.

00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:35.361 align:middle line:84%
You know, familia -- it's
all about the family.

00:31:35.361 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
You know? And people are
feeling very disconnected.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.336 align:middle line:84%
This can be a time
where we talked about.

00:31:44.336 --> 00:31:47.673 align:middle line:84%
It's time to individualize,
diversify.

00:31:47.673 --> 00:31:52.845 align:middle line:84%
Well, people are feeling
alienated, isolated.

00:31:52.845 --> 00:31:54.847 align:middle line:84%
You know, "My family
doesn't understand me."

00:31:54.847 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
My society; my church;
my business;

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
people don't understand --
and there is this time now,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.389 align:middle line:90%
and I think that the thing is --

00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:06.892 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I'm doing
these healing festivals and --

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:90%
it's about coming together.

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:15.367 align:middle line:84%
It's redefining family and
coming into our human family.

00:32:15.367 --> 00:32:22.708 align:middle line:84%
So, I encourage connection with
community of like-minded souls

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:27.112 align:middle line:84%
that just long for, and your
heart beats along the same,

00:32:27.112 --> 00:32:29.214 align:middle line:84%
wanting the same,
feeling the same.

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:31.517 align:middle line:90%
This is your family.

00:32:31.517 --> 00:32:35.621 align:middle line:84%
So, it's -- I encourage
people not to --

00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:39.391 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Cancer crab
crawls under the rock and hides

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:42.694 align:middle line:84%
and is afraid of being
rejected and hurt.

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:50.335 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage everyone to seek
and to open to new relationship,

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.439 align:middle line:84%
new family, new emotional
connections.

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:58.143 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to really
create this new paradigm.

00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: For people
that want to watch you

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:02.114 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis,

my God, I'm not crazy.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.428 align:middle line:90%
