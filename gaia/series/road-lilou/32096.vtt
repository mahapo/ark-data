>> Lilou: Hello my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:13.314 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:16.684 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road in London in
England today with Phil Parker.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:17.351 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:17.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Phil Parker: Hi.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:18.552 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:19.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Good.

00:00:19.854 --> 00:00:22.223 align:middle line:84%
I love being here especially
London under the sunshine.

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:23.157 align:middle line:90%
It's quite precious.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:23.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Parker: Awesome
isn't it.

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:24.992 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's as
good as it gets now.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.163 align:middle line:90%
This is really a special city.

00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:30.197 align:middle line:90%
Are you from London?

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.297 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you
practice in London.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Parker: I've
lived in London longer

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.068 align:middle line:90%
than I've lived anywhere else.

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:35.836 align:middle line:84%
I've lived in lots
of places but yeah,

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.037 align:middle line:90%
I guess, yeah I'm a Londoner.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh, so
you're an NLP Practitioner.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.243 align:middle line:90%
You're a Hay House author.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:46.147 align:middle line:84%
I want to really talk
about stress with you

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
because I remember being here
a few years ago and living here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and losing my job and how much
I got into the panic attacks

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.723 align:middle line:84%
and the stress and
there is this place

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:56.924 align:middle line:90%
where we can find ourselves

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
where there's just you
can't even barely breathe.

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:06.033 align:middle line:84%
How do you define all this
kind of emotions and--

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Parker: Well I
mean stress is just one

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.539 align:middle line:84%
of the commonest things there
is and part of the problem seems

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.009 align:middle line:84%
to be that we were designed
around a quite prehistoric,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.313 align:middle line:84%
primitive physiology
so we're in a cave.

00:01:19.313 --> 00:01:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Our main job is to eat, keep
ourselves warm, have babies

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.787 align:middle line:84%
and escape tigers or whatever
the wild beasts are at the time.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.857 align:middle line:84%
And if we come across
a threat then our body,

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:34.795 align:middle line:84%
our primitive response is to
launch into an action response,

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.565 align:middle line:84%
a thing called the
physical emergency response

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:40.501 align:middle line:84%
which basically ramps up
the strength in your muscles

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:44.438 align:middle line:84%
so you can punch the tiger and
your legs so you can run away.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's what I wanted
to do to my boss by the way.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.611 align:middle line:84%
>> Phil Parker: Well
this is the problem.

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.478 align:middle line:90%
There's two problems.

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.813 align:middle line:90%
First of all, that happens.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.716 align:middle line:84%
That's a very, very powerful
physiological response.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.586 align:middle line:84%
You know those stories where
women find their baby trapped

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
under a car and they
can lift the car.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.658 align:middle line:84%
You know, enormous energy is
channeled into the physiology

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:07.094 align:middle line:84%
of the muscles, of the arms and
legs but to do that you have

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.295 align:middle line:84%
to steal energy from
the rest of your body.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.931 align:middle line:84%
So certain things you don't
need, like you don't need

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.667 align:middle line:84%
to digest because
if a tiger appears

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.605 align:middle line:84%
and eat Mars bar it takes too
long to digest the chocolate

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:21.108 align:middle line:84%
because you versus
the tiger lasts what,

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.777 align:middle line:84%
three or four seconds and
either you've run away very,

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:27.248 align:middle line:84%
very cleverly or punched it or
it's eaten you and that's it.

00:02:27.248 --> 00:02:30.618 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is the
main hormones, adrenaline is one

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:32.286 align:middle line:84%
of the main hormones
everybody knows,

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:34.555 align:middle line:84%
hangs around in the body
for about 14 seconds.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:37.391 align:middle line:84%
You produce it within 14
seconds half of it is gone.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:39.093 align:middle line:84%
Another 14 seconds
another half of it is gone,

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:41.328 align:middle line:84%
so it's rapidly taken
out of your body

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.663 align:middle line:84%
because we don't need
it for that long.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.399 align:middle line:84%
The tiger appears and
it's resolved one way

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.634 align:middle line:90%
or the other very, very quickly.

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.103 align:middle line:84%
The problem we have of
course is we have still got

00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:51.739 align:middle line:84%
that primitive physiology
which is great for tigers

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.442 align:middle line:84%
but when your boss goes "You're
sacked" or "Do this again"

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:59.146 align:middle line:84%
or "You're late" or most
of the stress that you're

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:01.915 align:middle line:84%
under like a degree is
three or four years,

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:06.553 align:middle line:84%
a soap opera is 45 minutes,
a mortgage is 25 years,

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:11.058 align:middle line:84%
they're not within five or ten
seconds anyway so we respond

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:15.696 align:middle line:84%
and we're constantly triggering
this stress response the PER

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.865 align:middle line:84%
which okay, is fine
in small doses

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:21.435 align:middle line:84%
but in larger doses it just
causes havoc because you shut

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.304 align:middle line:90%
down your digestive functions.

00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:24.972 align:middle line:84%
That's no good for
your nutrition.

00:03:24.972 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You shut down your
immune system.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.509 align:middle line:84%
You shut down your
sleeping patterns.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.044 align:middle line:84%
You shut down your
clever thinking.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:32.012 align:middle line:84%
Because if a tiger
appears you don't kind

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:90%
of go whoooo, what should I do?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.651 align:middle line:84%
You just respond in a reflex way
so all those things, actually,

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.888 align:middle line:84%
what we need to resolve the
more long-term problems are

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:41.755 align:middle line:90%
that we need to sleep well.

00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:90%
We need to digest.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a good
functioning immune system

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.327 align:middle line:84%
and we need to be
thinking effectively.

00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And all those things are shut
down by long-term stress.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, but do we
need to live with stress?

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.802 align:middle line:90%
I mean how can we respond to it?

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.437 align:middle line:84%
How can we deal with
them effectively?

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:02.676 align:middle line:84%
How can we even maybe transform
it into something more exciting?

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.212 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Well the thing is that we
know that stress is a constant

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.514 align:middle line:84%
because stress is, there's
a lot of definitions,

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.117 align:middle line:84%
but the best definition is
stress is something we have

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
to respond to, something that
causes us to make a response.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.154 align:middle line:90%
The sun has just come out.

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:84%
You can probably
see it in the video.

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Our body has to respond.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.227 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] has to
respond to that.

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:21.695 align:middle line:84%
So there is always
going to be stress.

00:04:21.695 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Change is one of
those constants.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.233 align:middle line:84%
What we've got to learn to
do is to manage that better,

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.768 align:middle line:90%
to not get stressed about it.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.471 align:middle line:84%
So one of the books I've written
is a book called "The Du"

00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:31.805 align:middle line:90%
which you may have heard about.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.508 align:middle line:84%
And the Du, is just spelled
D-U, actually it's different

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:35.776 align:middle line:90%
in different languages.

00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.344 align:middle line:84%
I know your French so you
don't call it Du in French

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:40.414 align:middle line:84%
but it's D-U, the
circumflex in English

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:43.784 align:middle line:84%
and what it says is classically,
people will say stuff like,

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:47.488 align:middle line:84%
"I am stressed about the world
economy," which is a thing

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:48.856 align:middle line:84%
that a lot people are
saying at the moment.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:50.924 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this
is they're saying

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.862 align:middle line:84%
that basically the world
economy is causing my stress.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.364 align:middle line:84%
I am at the end of it
and this is the problem.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I'm a victim.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:58.999 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.267 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing I
can do about it

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.902 align:middle line:84%
because I can't change
the world economy.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:03.837 align:middle line:84%
I have to wait for it to
change, for other people

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:07.441 align:middle line:84%
to sort it then I can get
unstressed and the problem

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:10.244 align:middle line:84%
with this conversation is that
puts you in the victim position

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:11.612 align:middle line:84%
where there's nothing
you can do about it

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.113 align:middle line:84%
which of course further
stresses us.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:14.982 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we hate
more than not being able

00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
to do anything about it.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.852 align:middle line:84%
So the Du, which is this
new word says we need

00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:20.587 align:middle line:90%
to change our language about it

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:23.457 align:middle line:84%
because our language
misunderstands it.

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle line:84%
We should a say instead
of I am stressed

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.529 align:middle line:84%
about the world economy we
should say I am duing stress

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.297 align:middle line:90%
with this U with the circumflex.

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:33.834 align:middle line:84%
So the du with the U is
different from the do with the O

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.402 align:middle line:84%
because it's saying you're
not doing it on purpose.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.838 align:middle line:84%
It's not like saying
you're doing it on purpose.

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.507 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to be a
response you've got into.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.243 align:middle line:84%
But it is you that's
doing it unconsciously.

00:05:43.243 --> 00:05:44.945 align:middle line:84%
So if it's you that's
duing it there's a chance

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:45.646 align:middle line:90%
that you can not du it.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:46.847 align:middle line:90%
You can switch that off.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.982 align:middle line:84%
So you start to become
powerful in that situation

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:50.617 align:middle line:90%
where you felt you had no power.

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:52.286 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as soon
as you are regain a sense

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:57.024 align:middle line:84%
of power then stress reduces and
then you can work out what to do

00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:59.259 align:middle line:84%
about it to actually
change your response.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.728 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing is
to realize that stress,

00:06:01.728 --> 00:06:04.798 align:middle line:90%
stress doesn't actually exist.

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:09.036 align:middle line:84%
What happens are events
like tigers or being sacked

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.872 align:middle line:84%
and then we respond in
a stressful way or not.

00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And so for one person going

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.844 align:middle line:84%
on stage is the most stressful
thing they can imagine.

00:06:16.844 --> 00:06:19.446 align:middle line:84%
It's a very common phobia
and for other people like me

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.281 align:middle line:84%
and my friends we
talk all the time.

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:22.683 align:middle line:90%
We love going on stage.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:25.452 align:middle line:84%
Like show us a stage and we're
on there doing our thing singing

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.921 align:middle line:84%
and dancing, so the
stage is not stressful.

00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.491 align:middle line:84%
The question is what
is our response to it?

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:32.291 align:middle line:84%
What is our anticipation
our expectation?

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It feels like when we're going
through those stressful moments

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle line:84%
or wanting to get
rid of that fear

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.801 align:middle line:84%
or that stressful event
it keeps on coming back.

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:41.869 align:middle line:90%
Like we have those instances

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
where it's like, oh,
yeah, this is it.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.973 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to do it and
then right back in it,

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:84%
where we thought we were
out and the panic zone

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.142 align:middle line:90%
and we're right back in it

00:06:50.142 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Yeah, but again if
you look at the Du it says

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.449 align:middle line:84%
that it's not the thing
that's causing the stress.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.385 align:middle line:84%
It's you. You are
constantly duing the stress

00:06:58.385 --> 00:06:59.853 align:middle line:90%
to yourself again.

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:02.356 align:middle line:84%
And if you can switch it off,
if you can stop it for a period

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:04.091 align:middle line:84%
of time then it means
you can stop it any time.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:84%
You just need to remember
what you did strategically

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.796 align:middle line:84%
so that each time those
events come you turn it off.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.598 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
about panic attacks,

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:15.202 align:middle line:84%
which I think are the big
daddy of stress, is that,

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:18.372 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen loads of
people with extraordinary,

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:20.073 align:middle line:84%
what we would call
brilliant panic attacks.

00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:21.675 align:middle line:90%
You know they are so good

00:07:21.675 --> 00:07:24.411 align:middle line:84%
that literally they
can become paralyzed.

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.812 align:middle line:90%
Their legs will stop working.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.682 align:middle line:84%
They'll end up in the hospital
and the doctors will scan them

00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:30.784 align:middle line:84%
and do everything and go
there's nothing wrong with you.

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:31.852 align:middle line:90%
You need to go and see Phil.

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.787 align:middle line:84%
So I get a lot of
people coming to see me.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.889 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
very, very strong--

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're
Dr. Phil in England.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.492 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:42.229 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Well actually I'm
just in my PhD at the moment,

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:43.931 align:middle line:84%
so at some point I
will be Dr. Phil.

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.233 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk to you about my
PhD that's very interesting.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.835 align:middle line:84%
It's all about substance,
recovery from substance abuse

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.305 align:middle line:84%
and addictions, using
the same technology.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:52.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Very important topic.

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:54.141 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: Yeah but panic attacks,

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.243 align:middle line:84%
what happens is something
happens.

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:57.945 align:middle line:84%
You're going along
normally in your life

00:07:57.945 --> 00:08:00.247 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly you have
these immense symptoms,

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:06.653 align:middle line:84%
very often hot, trembly,
nauseous, head spinning, wobbly.

00:08:06.653 --> 00:08:09.156 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, all the classic signs
which are basically the signs

00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:11.692 align:middle line:84%
of adrenaline and the
part of our nervous system

00:08:11.692 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
which is called the sympathetic
nervous system which prepares us

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.098 align:middle line:84%
for this tiger experience but
the symptoms are so powerful

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:20.434 align:middle line:84%
and if you've ever had them,
most people have had something

00:08:20.434 --> 00:08:24.071 align:middle line:84%
like this at some point, you
get stressed by the symptoms.

00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.206 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God, what's that?

00:08:26.206 --> 00:08:28.508 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to die?

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:33.946 align:middle line:84%
You start sweating and so
that produces another stress

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:36.817 align:middle line:84%
which heightens the
adrenaline sympathetic arousal

00:08:36.817 --> 00:08:39.786 align:middle line:84%
which increases your symptoms
and suddenly you just get on one

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:40.887 align:middle line:90%
of these vicious cycles

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.091 align:middle line:84%
where your symptoms
create more symptoms.

00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:48.295 align:middle line:84%
But if you can find a
way to turn that down,

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:52.199 align:middle line:84%
switch that off then
everything fades.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:57.738 align:middle line:84%
So you may notice, as I
said that my voice slowed

00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:04.311 align:middle line:84%
and my words became quieter and
the reason is it's impossible

00:09:04.311 --> 00:09:09.216 align:middle line:84%
to keep stress up to do
stress, to continue do stress

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:12.486 align:middle line:90%
if you start talking calmly.

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:13.387 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.055 align:middle line:90%
Your brain doesn't understand.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.624 align:middle line:84%
This is from my latest book
"Get The Life You Love Now."

00:09:17.624 --> 00:09:19.826 align:middle line:90%
Some fascinating studies.

00:09:19.826 --> 00:09:25.532 align:middle line:84%
One of the studies is if you get
a pencil and you put a pencil

00:09:25.532 --> 00:09:29.036 align:middle line:84%
in your mouth where my finger
is and then try to think

00:09:29.036 --> 00:09:30.337 align:middle line:90%
about something upsetting

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.039 align:middle line:84%
and unhappy you won't
be able to do it.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:35.876 align:middle line:84%
The reason is the pencil
puts your mouth into a smile.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.678 align:middle line:84%
This triggers parts of
your brain that knows

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:40.414 align:middle line:84%
about happiness just
because the facial expression

00:09:40.414 --> 00:09:42.049 align:middle line:90%
of smile is linked to happiness

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes much
more difficult

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.919 align:middle line:84%
to access the negative
thoughts as a result.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:48.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: If we see lots of
people from now on with pencils

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
in the streets of London

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.659 align:middle line:84%
and around the world we
know you've been there

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Well they
did another study,

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:59.566 align:middle line:84%
a really interesting study with
Botox, you know Botox, yeah?

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:01.768 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was if you took women

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:05.872 align:middle line:84%
and you inject mainly
women obviously, inject it.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Men like it too, huh?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.641 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: I know.

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:09.309 align:middle line:84%
In the study it was women,
inject them with Botox

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:12.412 align:middle line:84%
and then get them to think
about an angry thought.

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:14.915 align:middle line:84%
They can't produce as
much anger as the people

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.818 align:middle line:84%
who don't have Botox
because then their brows will

00:10:17.818 --> 00:10:19.186 align:middle line:90%
not furrow.

00:10:19.186 --> 00:10:22.389 align:middle line:84%
They can't do that and their
brain goes "I'm a bit confused,

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.724 align:middle line:84%
am I supposed to
be angry or not?

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:26.426 align:middle line:84%
Because my face isn't doing
angry just my thoughts are."

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:32.299 align:middle line:84%
And the brain is easily tricked
out of this vicious circle by,

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:36.403 align:middle line:84%
if you have anxiety
just slow your internal

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:38.038 align:middle line:84%
because we all talk
to ourselves,

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.606 align:middle line:90%
your internal voice down.

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.208 align:middle line:90%
If you could put a microphone

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.943 align:middle line:84%
in someone's head who's
stressed you would hear,

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:45.112 align:middle line:90%
oh my God, oh my God, ah.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.346 align:middle line:90%
Very, very fast.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:50.417 align:middle line:84%
And they don't say you know
what, this is solvable.

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.618 align:middle line:90%
This is fine.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:53.987 align:middle line:84%
You would here this
very, very, busy.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You have hundreds

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:57.324 align:middle line:84%
of reasons why you
should be stressed too.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: Absolutely.

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.628 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is that if
you slow you're internal voice

00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:05.732 align:middle line:84%
down because obviously when
we speak we use our diaphragm

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle line:90%
and our chest.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.236 align:middle line:84%
The speed of our
breathing is affected

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:10.637 align:middle line:90%
by the speed of our talking.

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:11.638 align:middle line:90%
So I talk quite fast.

00:11:11.638 --> 00:11:12.973 align:middle line:90%
My breathing is quite fast.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:16.676 align:middle line:84%
But if I slow my voice down
then naturally my breathing

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.211 align:middle line:90%
slows too.

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.446 align:middle line:90%
If you just slow the voice

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.648 align:middle line:84%
down in your head your brain
will slow your breathing

00:11:21.648 --> 00:11:24.851 align:middle line:84%
down because it kind of connects
our voices in your head,

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.054 align:middle line:84%
the talking that we all do,
with real talking verbal,

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.956 align:middle line:90%
outside talking and breathing.

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:31.224 align:middle line:90%
So one of the simplest ways

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:34.761 align:middle line:84%
to just break a panic
attack is just to slow

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:90%
down your mental thoughts.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the last thing you think of
when you're busy like a hamster

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.003 align:middle line:84%
on a wheel but it's the
first thing you should do.

00:11:43.003 --> 00:11:45.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How is
that linked to NLP?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.874 align:middle line:84%
What that whole thing,
that whole conversation?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, NLP, there's lots of
different versions of NLP.

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:55.415 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to think about
NLP and the lightening processes

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:59.886 align:middle line:84%
which have a common heritage is
the most important thing we can

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.823 align:middle line:84%
learn is probably
The Serenity Prayer.

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:04.291 align:middle line:90%
Do you know The Serenity Prayer?

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:07.794 align:middle line:84%
It's a really interesting prayer
and it says, "God grant me"--

00:12:07.794 --> 00:12:09.362 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be
religious to buy into it.

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But it says "God grant me the
serenity to accept the things

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.236 align:middle line:90%
that I cannot change;

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:20.073 align:middle line:84%
the courage to change the
things I can and the wisdom

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:21.575 align:middle line:84%
to know the difference
between those two."

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.143 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we get stuck.

00:12:23.143 --> 00:12:25.812 align:middle line:84%
We spend so much time and
again it comes back to the du.

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.715 align:middle line:84%
We spend so much time trying to
change things we can't change.

00:12:28.715 --> 00:12:29.883 align:middle line:90%
If only the weather were better.

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.118 align:middle line:90%
If that airplane weren't flying

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:84%
over our heads right now
when we're recording.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.189 align:middle line:84%
My wife, I want my wife
to be this or that.

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:38.225 align:middle line:84%
We spend so much time trying
to change things that are

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:41.328 align:middle line:84%
out of our control and not
enough time changing the things

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:43.864 align:middle line:84%
that are in our control
which primarily is us.

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:47.067 align:middle line:84%
And we have immense
power over that.

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.168 align:middle line:90%
This is our universe.

00:12:48.168 --> 00:12:49.536 align:middle line:84%
You know we may be able
to effect the world

00:12:49.536 --> 00:12:50.837 align:middle line:84%
with affirmations and
all the rest of it

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:53.707 align:middle line:84%
but the one thing that's
absolutely certain is we can

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.642 align:middle line:84%
change ourselves,
our ways of thinking

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:57.444 align:middle line:84%
and our physiology
because this is us.

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:02.782 align:middle line:84%
This is our world, so learning
how to change your state,

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:90%
your state of mind, your state

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.119 align:middle line:84%
of physiology is a
really important tool

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.388 align:middle line:84%
and that is what a
lot of NLP is about.

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:11.892 align:middle line:84%
It's how do you change
how you respond to things.

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:15.929 align:middle line:84%
And NLP gives a real fast
track to making genuine change

00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:18.999 align:middle line:84%
so you can start to learn
how to shift your state.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.636 align:middle line:84%
So instead of getting stressed
you can actually realize oh,

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:25.739 align:middle line:84%
I have a set of choices here and
I can make different choices.

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:28.541 align:middle line:84%
And the lightning process is
very specifically for health,

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:90%
the mind body connection.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.381 align:middle line:84%
How do you shift when you get
into massively destructive,

00:13:34.381 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:84%
vicious spirals of physiology,
bad health, immune function,

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:41.588 align:middle line:84%
pain, all sorts of
stuff, anxiety,

00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:45.492 align:middle line:90%
depression, bipolar, allergies.

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.662 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that rut
what do you do then?

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:51.431 align:middle line:84%
Because that's quite a
difficult place to move from.

00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle line:84%
When medicine is saying there's
nothing you can do about this

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.604 align:middle line:84%
and you've tried
everything and nothing works.

00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:00.373 align:middle line:84%
Getting out of that
hole is quite a thing

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.208 align:middle line:84%
but the lightning
process is really,

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:90%
really helpful at doing that.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So are there steps?

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that a program?

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.782 align:middle line:90%
Is there a different exercise?

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:10.050 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.518 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: With the lightning
process it's a little bit

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:12.619 align:middle line:90%
complicated to explain

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:15.288 align:middle line:84%
but fundamentally it's
a three day seminar

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:17.057 align:middle line:90%
where you learn the tools.

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.758 align:middle line:90%
But like any set of tools it's

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.393 align:middle line:84%
about putting them
into practice.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.062 align:middle line:90%
What the tools fundamentally are

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.164 align:middle line:84%
if you guys step
back a little bit,

00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:27.434 align:middle line:84%
starting the lightning process
because I had lots of patients

00:14:27.434 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle line:84%
who came to see me and my
background is I'm an osteopath,

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.872 align:middle line:84%
so like physical
therapist and hypnotherapist

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:35.542 align:middle line:84%
and NLP Practitioner,
Life Coach.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:38.645 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was people
would send me their worst cases.

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:40.313 align:middle line:84%
So all my friends who were
osteopaths would say go

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.114 align:middle line:90%
see Phil.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:42.248 align:middle line:90%
He's got some extra skills.

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.717 align:middle line:84%
And all my friends who
were psychotherapists

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.552 align:middle line:84%
and hypnotherapist
said, "Go and see Phil.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.786 align:middle line:90%
He's got some extra skills."

00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to get people
who had tried everything

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.358 align:middle line:84%
and hadn't really got
the change they wanted,

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:54.127 align:middle line:84%
so they were by definition
stuck.

00:14:54.127 --> 00:14:56.363 align:middle line:84%
So I did my best
tricks on them and some

00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:59.933 align:middle line:84%
of them responded brilliantly as
I would hope they would and some

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:00.834 align:middle line:90%
of them didn't respond.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:01.835 align:middle line:90%
And I was like hum, why is that?

00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:04.304 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
I remember a case.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:06.673 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman who
had come to see me

00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:09.409 align:middle line:84%
and she had literally been
gang raped by 12 people

00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.478 align:middle line:84%
when she was a teen-ager
which you would imagine was

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.847 align:middle line:84%
like well that's got to
be tough to get over it.

00:15:13.847 --> 00:15:15.015 align:middle line:90%
We did some NLP.

00:15:15.015 --> 00:15:18.018 align:middle line:84%
A couple of sessions
later she had resolved it.

00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
She hadn't forgotten it happened
but she had come to terms

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:22.789 align:middle line:84%
with it and it was no longer
influencing her future.

00:15:22.789 --> 00:15:24.524 align:middle line:84%
She could build relationships
with men;

00:15:24.524 --> 00:15:26.026 align:middle line:84%
feel good about herself
and all the rest

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.427 align:middle line:90%
of it, which is a result.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then in the afternoon I saw
somebody whose father had told

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.833 align:middle line:84%
her she was a little bit
overweight once and that was it.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:36.236 align:middle line:90%
Her self-esteem was on the floor

00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:38.405 align:middle line:84%
and nothing I did
made any difference.

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:39.806 align:middle line:90%
Now I said that's a bit odd.

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:44.677 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that the gang rape
victim would be more difficult

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:48.048 align:middle line:84%
to help than the person who'd
just had this relatively throw

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.583 align:middle line:84%
away comment about
being overweight,

00:15:50.583 --> 00:15:51.785 align:middle line:90%
so what's the difference?

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:53.386 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to
do to make the change

00:15:53.386 --> 00:15:56.556 align:middle line:84%
because it's not the severity or
the complexity of the problem?

00:15:56.556 --> 00:15:58.858 align:middle line:84%
What needs to make
change happen?

00:15:58.858 --> 00:16:02.595 align:middle line:84%
So I started a research
program into what makes change?

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:04.564 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
lightning process came from.

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:07.934 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to do to help
people who've gotten stuck

00:16:07.934 --> 00:16:09.335 align:middle line:90%
and want to change?

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:12.272 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're resistant
to change or they don't want it

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:14.974 align:middle line:84%
or not committed to change but
they just don't know what to do.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.643 align:middle line:90%
They just got lost somewhere.

00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:18.912 align:middle line:84%
They've got lots of
evidence why nothing works

00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I designed
the lightning process.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.084 align:middle line:84%
It's a journey that takes
people from being stuck

00:16:24.084 --> 00:16:25.885 align:middle line:84%
through to opportunity
and possibility.

00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:32.058 align:middle line:84%
So over the three days they
fundamentally learn the process

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:34.227 align:middle line:84%
which allows them to
regain their power,

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:39.132 align:middle line:84%
to take full influence in their
health and their lives and--

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:41.201 align:middle line:84%
a lovely bee coming
to visit-- hello bee--

00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:45.839 align:middle line:84%
and the other thing it does
is it teaches them some steps.

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.608 align:middle line:84%
So the steps fundamentally
are recognizing

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:50.176 align:middle line:90%
when you've gone off track.

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.578 align:middle line:90%
So we call in the pit.

00:16:51.578 --> 00:16:53.446 align:middle line:84%
So when you're not
having a life you love.

00:16:53.446 --> 00:16:54.981 align:middle line:84%
So the book "Get
the Life You Love."

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It's all about get
the life you love.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.852 align:middle line:84%
The lightning process has
the same theme as well.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:01.754 align:middle line:84%
When you're not having the life
you love then you're in the pit.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:02.922 align:middle line:90%
Now what's interesting is

00:17:02.922 --> 00:17:06.658 align:middle line:84%
that if you ask people
what percentage

00:17:06.658 --> 00:17:08.061 align:middle line:84%
of the time do you
have a life you love?

00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:11.097 align:middle line:84%
They'll go, if you ask them what
percentage of the time are you

00:17:11.097 --> 00:17:12.532 align:middle line:84%
in the pit, they'll go,
"Oh, about 20 percent."

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.533 align:middle line:84%
And then you say,
"What percentage

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.702 align:middle line:84%
of the time do you
have a life you love?"

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:16.802 align:middle line:84%
And they'll go "About
20 percent."

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.272 align:middle line:90%
Well actually that means

00:17:19.272 --> 00:17:21.741 align:middle line:84%
if you're only 20 percent having
a life you love then 80 percent

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.909 align:middle line:84%
of the time you're in the
pit to one state or another.

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.311 align:middle line:84%
You're just not even
noticing it.

00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:29.282 align:middle line:84%
So we spend a lot of our time in
a kind of average, mediocre kind

00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:32.085 align:middle line:84%
of life state which
isn't very good for us.

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.155 align:middle line:84%
So it's spotting the pit,
becoming aware of what that is,

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:38.124 align:middle line:84%
then teaching us to make
choices and then teaching them

00:17:38.124 --> 00:17:41.327 align:middle line:84%
to start changing their internal
conversation with themselves

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:43.797 align:middle line:84%
and changing the state, the
mindset that they get into.

00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So we teach them that in
this three-day program,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.801 align:middle line:84%
give them feedback,
support them doing that

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.671 align:middle line:84%
and it's just really effective
at helping people make change.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:53.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Tell us more
now since we have time.

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
really good ones?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.281 align:middle line:84%
Like in that process, what is
the thing that can shift us

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:03.349 align:middle line:84%
like right now for
the people listening?

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:10.323 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: The things I've seen,
core things are you've got

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:15.094 align:middle line:84%
to develop an awareness
of when we're off track.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.964 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't have
a decent enough awareness.

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:20.099 align:middle line:84%
They think being
a bit pissed off

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.435 align:middle line:84%
in a supermarket
queue is reasonable.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well yeah,
it's reasonable.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.172 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are but
is it life enhancing?

00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:28.174 align:middle line:84%
So if you change
your conversation

00:18:28.174 --> 00:18:31.978 align:middle line:84%
to I'm having a great life
rather than is life shit?

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:32.812 align:middle line:90%
Those two are not--

00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:33.947 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's a normal thing

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.682 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: So like no, well come on.

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
There's a great quote
by George Bernard Shaw.

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:42.088 align:middle line:84%
"I want to burn my candle
all the way down to the end.

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:45.258 align:middle line:84%
I want to shine my light
brightly as I possibly can."

00:18:45.258 --> 00:18:47.026 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have that
oppression every day,

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:50.029 align:middle line:84%
every moment has to be
super magical but we do want

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:52.398 align:middle line:84%
to be moving towards having
as great a life as we can.

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:53.766 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:56.469 align:middle line:84%
Second thing is to know
you always have a choice.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.438 align:middle line:84%
In the work in dealing
with addiction,

00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:01.674 align:middle line:84%
what was really fascinating
was people finally recognizing

00:19:01.674 --> 00:19:03.543 align:middle line:90%
that they always had a choice,

00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:05.211 align:middle line:84%
which is the thing
they don't feel like.

00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
The drug leaps into
their system.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.582 align:middle line:84%
But we find this of course
with people who overeat.

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:11.584 align:middle line:84%
They say, "I went to the
supermarket and I don't know how

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:12.418 align:middle line:90%
that cake got in there.

00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:13.553 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:19:13.553 --> 00:19:14.821 align:middle line:90%
One minute it was on the shelf

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.055 align:middle line:84%
and the next minute it
was in the trolley."

00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Having no control.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.891 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Yeah, that sense
that we don't have a choice

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:19.993 align:middle line:90%
about things.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.795 align:middle line:84%
And then the next set
of things are things

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
like realizing how important
it is to be nice to ourselves,

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:32.805 align:middle line:84%
to love who we are, to have
deep compassion for ourselves

00:19:32.805 --> 00:19:35.675 align:middle line:90%
and to be congruent, to convey

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.477 align:middle line:84%
that to ourselves
in every moment.

00:19:37.477 --> 00:19:39.779 align:middle line:84%
Those kind of things are
really, really essential.

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's so essential, the
love that we have for ourselves.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:46.786 align:middle line:84%
That's what's missing really
in this whole process.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: In stress and fear
there's no place for love.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.891 align:middle line:90%
It's busy, busy, busy, busy.

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:53.593 align:middle line:90%
There's no looking inside.

00:19:53.593 --> 00:19:56.462 align:middle line:84%
Again with the nervous
system there's two bits

00:19:56.462 --> 00:19:58.531 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system
that control us.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:01.334 align:middle line:84%
The sympathetic which
is, where's the tiger,

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:04.337 align:middle line:84%
being on alert, being like
a meerkat constantly looking

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:06.673 align:middle line:84%
at things, being
busy, being out there.

00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:11.711 align:middle line:84%
And parasympathetic which is
the opposite part our physiology

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:17.717 align:middle line:84%
that switches us into calm,
meditative relaxation,

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:21.621 align:middle line:84%
digestion, having sex,
giving birth, all those kind

00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:25.325 align:middle line:84%
of nurturing, health-giving
behaviors.

00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:28.594 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in stress,
fear, arousal, alert,

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:32.965 align:middle line:84%
busy out there trying to
sort stuff you can't be

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:90%
in calm, peace.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.668 align:middle line:90%
Like with a smile.

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're smiling it's
very difficult to think

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.805 align:middle line:90%
about stressful thoughts.

00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:40.907 align:middle line:84%
If you're stressful it's
very difficult to think

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.409 align:middle line:84%
about calming nice
loving thoughts.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:44.844 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, there's a massive theme

00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:46.946 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just me
who talks about this.

00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.048 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
as I've done more

00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:53.486 align:middle line:84%
and more research is the ideas
I came up with are echoed

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:56.322 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhist literature,
in Christian literature,

00:20:56.322 --> 00:21:01.494 align:middle line:84%
in mindfulness, in so many
places you here the same themes.

00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:03.196 align:middle line:90%
There's a quote by Diogenes

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:05.898 align:middle line:84%
for instance who's a
Greek philosopher famous

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:07.033 align:middle line:90%
for two things.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.068 align:middle line:84%
He liked to drink a lot
and he lived in a barrel

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:11.671 align:middle line:84%
for a long time for no
good reason and that's

00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:12.839 align:middle line:90%
about all we know about him.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:14.741 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
he said was,

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.577 align:middle line:84%
"No man can be hurt
but by himself."

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:20.012 align:middle line:90%
Only us can hurt ourselves.

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:25.618 align:middle line:84%
Well that's like thousands
and thousands of years ago.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.755 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look you
see these same messages.

00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:31.791 align:middle line:84%
What's intriguing is how we
keep on avoiding these messages.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.026 align:middle line:84%
We fail to take them on
board and what I try to do

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:35.328 align:middle line:84%
with the lightning
process which seems

00:21:35.328 --> 00:21:39.265 align:middle line:84%
to be very successful is
say we shouldn't treat these

00:21:39.265 --> 00:21:42.268 align:middle line:84%
as high philosophical
constructs.

00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:43.669 align:middle line:90%
These are truths.

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:46.272 align:middle line:84%
These are real things that we
need to put into practical life.

00:21:46.272 --> 00:21:48.641 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to live in a
monastery to make this happen.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:53.379 align:middle line:84%
It's easy if you live in a
Zen environment with fresh air

00:21:53.379 --> 00:21:55.581 align:middle line:84%
and somebody cooking
you organic food for you

00:21:55.581 --> 00:21:58.184 align:middle line:84%
to stay relatively calm but how
do we do that in the real world

00:21:58.184 --> 00:21:59.419 align:middle line:90%
that most of us live in?

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:01.421 align:middle line:84%
Which is like that in a
particularly nice bit of it

00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:05.324 align:middle line:84%
but it's still noisy, polluted,
lots of people, lots of stuff.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:10.263 align:middle line:84%
How do we live the
good life and have fun?

00:22:10.263 --> 00:22:12.131 align:middle line:84%
And you know I think
fun is really important.

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:15.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Essential.

00:22:15.034 --> 00:22:16.035 align:middle line:90%
British know that.

00:22:16.035 --> 00:22:18.838 align:middle line:84%
The humor, how important,
laughing.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:22.275 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: I had a client who lived

00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:24.577 align:middle line:84%
on this little island
called the Isle of Wight.

00:22:24.577 --> 00:22:26.212 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know it.

00:22:26.212 --> 00:22:28.448 align:middle line:84%
It's a tiny island and they
were on the Gerson Diet.

00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:29.649 align:middle line:90%
You know the Gerson Diet?

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:33.019 align:middle line:84%
Which is like raw foods,
raw vegetables basically.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:38.858 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
was they got

00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:42.929 align:middle line:84%
so stressed sourcing
organic vegetables

00:22:42.929 --> 00:22:44.163 align:middle line:90%
on this little island.

00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:46.933 align:middle line:84%
They were like we've got
to find an organic avocado.

00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:90%
We've got to find one.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.801 align:middle line:90%
We've got to find one.

00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:49.969 align:middle line:84%
And they drove around
all week trying

00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:52.605 align:middle line:84%
to find an organic
avocado for their salad.

00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:55.608 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
organic avocado is great.

00:22:55.608 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:90%
They're lovely.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.443 align:middle line:90%
They're very good for you.

00:22:57.443 --> 00:23:00.012 align:middle line:84%
That's fantastic but
in terms of balance,

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:01.547 align:middle line:90%
being massively stressed,

00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
trying to source organic food
you're probably better off going

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.619 align:middle line:90%
to the local McDonald's.

00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:07.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Counter-productive.

00:23:07.887 --> 00:23:10.556 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: McDonald's isn't
probably the best thing for you.

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:14.961 align:middle line:84%
The amount of cost to you of
getting into that state in order

00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:18.264 align:middle line:84%
to get one organic avocado
probably doesn't balance out

00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:21.567 align:middle line:84%
and I think balance is very
important as well in this.

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:25.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are some of the
other elements or pit falls?

00:23:25.505 --> 00:23:28.374 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: There are millions and
we all have our own special one.

00:23:28.374 --> 00:23:29.575 align:middle line:90%
One of the things we do a lot

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.677 align:middle line:84%
in the lightning process
particularly is get people

00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to start to listen inside
and go what are you saying?

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.481 align:middle line:84%
What are you consistently
saying?

00:23:35.481 --> 00:23:39.252 align:middle line:84%
So for instance in stress the
almost consistent feature you'll

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:41.554 align:middle line:90%
find is people going what if.

00:23:41.554 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like what
if I won the lottery

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.158 align:middle line:84%
and had all the money
and a beautiful husband?

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.393 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what if
this goes wrong?

00:23:47.393 --> 00:23:48.761 align:middle line:90%
And then this goes wrong.

00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:53.432 align:middle line:84%
Sort of catastrophizing, as
I call it, comparing yourself

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:55.668 align:middle line:90%
to others is a complete no-no.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So many opportunities to
look at somebody else and go,

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.706 align:middle line:84%
she's a little bit more gorgeous
or slimmer than me or younger

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:03.442 align:middle line:84%
or attractive or French
or whatever it is.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.778 align:middle line:84%
There's so many ways
we can do that.

00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:08.814 align:middle line:84%
Another brilliant way of messing
up your life is perfectionism.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:12.218 align:middle line:84%
You know where you look
and you can see the flaws

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and particularly
in your own self.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.256 align:middle line:90%
So even if you get an A or first

00:24:17.256 --> 00:24:21.827 align:middle line:84%
in your degree you know why
it should have been better

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:23.729 align:middle line:84%
than it was so there's
no happiness

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.131 align:middle line:90%
or joy to be found anywhere.

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.767 align:middle line:84%
And we know happiness and joy,
I don't know if you know this

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:31.571 align:middle line:84%
but a recent study in
2011 by a couple of guys

00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:32.605 align:middle line:84%
who are well-known
for their research

00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:34.974 align:middle line:84%
into happiness called
Diener and Chan,

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:36.542 align:middle line:90%
found that on average people

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:39.979 align:middle line:84%
who were happy lived
an extra ten years.

00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:42.415 align:middle line:84%
So ten years, that's not just
ten years, it's ten years

00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:44.984 align:middle line:84%
of happy life and ten years
of healthy life because health

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.852 align:middle line:84%
and happiness are linked
and when you compare

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:51.057 align:middle line:84%
that to smoking, smoking costs
you an average ten years.

00:24:51.057 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So the government spends a lot
of money trying to get people

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:57.763 align:middle line:84%
to not smoke because they
know how bad it is for people

00:24:57.763 --> 00:24:59.665 align:middle line:84%
but don't spend much
time promoting happiness.

00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:00.866 align:middle line:90%
It's probably a good thing.

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.134 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't want
government happiness.

00:25:02.134 --> 00:25:03.436 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
that would look like

00:25:03.436 --> 00:25:06.272 align:middle line:84%
and probably the worst thing
there could be is a grumpy

00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:09.375 align:middle line:84%
smoker, if you're
an unhappy smoker

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.877 align:middle line:90%
that is really not good for you.

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:14.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Inaudible] Do you see
some recurring trends right now

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.082 align:middle line:84%
since you're meeting
a lot of people?

00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:18.551 align:middle line:84%
Is it getting more and more,
people are getting more and more

00:25:18.551 --> 00:25:22.054 align:middle line:84%
into those addictive
patterns or getting off faster

00:25:22.054 --> 00:25:25.224 align:middle line:84%
or what is the--
do you see a sort

00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:28.294 align:middle line:90%
of evolution of human beings?

00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:31.197 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: That's an
interesting question.

00:25:31.197 --> 00:25:34.834 align:middle line:84%
I think, I mean I've been doing
this for, since 1980-something,

00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:41.641 align:middle line:84%
'84 when I started and I
still have, in the old days,

00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:43.976 align:middle line:84%
before the Internet, used
to have an encyclopedia,

00:25:43.976 --> 00:25:46.712 align:middle line:84%
a book of facts, and I
got a one at Christmas

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.648 align:middle line:84%
and I remember it
saying osteopathy

00:25:48.648 --> 00:25:50.449 align:middle line:84%
and it had a little
definition of osteopathy

00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:52.051 align:middle line:84%
because I was just
becoming osteopath

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:54.286 align:middle line:90%
and it was defined as quackery.

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:57.523 align:middle line:84%
In this official book it
said this pretend made

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:01.427 align:middle line:84%
up health care system
that's nonsense.

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:07.466 align:middle line:84%
And in my period of professional
career I've seen a shift,

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:12.405 align:middle line:84%
a lot of shifts of alternative
medicine becoming more

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:16.742 align:middle line:84%
acceptable to more people,
less elitist, less you have

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:84%
to be a bit weird and you'll
get defined becoming much

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:90%
more commonplace.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
There's also been, more
recently, a rise in scientism.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.723 align:middle line:84%
So people who are obsessed
with the religion of science,

00:26:30.723 --> 00:26:33.492 align:middle line:84%
that science is the truth
and nothing else matters,

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:35.861 align:middle line:84%
forgetting of course
that science is done

00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
by real humans on real humans.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.032 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole bunch of
subjectivity that comes

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:43.235 align:middle line:84%
into science that
involves any health care.

00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:48.974 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a real upsurge,
certainly in the UK of attacks

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:52.645 align:middle line:84%
against alternative
practitioners

00:26:52.645 --> 00:26:54.647 align:middle line:90%
or contemporary thinkers.

00:26:54.647 --> 00:26:56.048 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.751 align:middle line:84%
It's like going back to medieval
times when the church was king.

00:26:58.751 --> 00:27:02.955 align:middle line:84%
When the church said this is
the way it is so Copernicus

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:06.492 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that the earth
was the center of the universe

00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:08.928 align:middle line:84%
and he found from his studies
that actually it looked

00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:11.097 align:middle line:84%
like the sun was the
center of the solar system

00:27:11.097 --> 00:27:13.966 align:middle line:84%
and the sun wasn't the center
of the universe and he was

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:17.203 align:middle line:84%
in real trouble for even
mentioning these heretical ideas

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:19.305 align:middle line:84%
and we're in a little bit the
same position at the moment

00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:84%
where the dominance of certainly
pharmaceutical companies,

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.313 align:middle line:84%
the dominance of the
medical profession

00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:31.517 align:middle line:84%
in defining what constitutes
good health care practice.

00:27:31.517 --> 00:27:35.588 align:middle line:84%
I mean for me doctors have an
amazing job, an amazing role.

00:27:35.588 --> 00:27:38.591 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a car crash
the doctor is exactly

00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:39.792 align:middle line:90%
where you'll want to go.

00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:40.926 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't want
to come and see me at all.

00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:43.996 align:middle line:84%
You'll want to go and
see accident emergencies

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.198 align:middle line:84%
and their very good at that and
they're very good at surgery

00:27:46.198 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're very good at certain
things and there's other things

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.336 align:middle line:84%
that my doctor friends
are very happy

00:27:50.336 --> 00:27:52.438 align:middle line:84%
to admit is they're
not very good at.

00:27:52.438 --> 00:27:53.806 align:middle line:84%
They're not very
good at anxiety.

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.641 align:middle line:84%
They're not very good at
helping people with stress,

00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:58.811 align:middle line:84%
with their marital problems,
with general symptoms

00:27:58.811 --> 00:28:03.449 align:middle line:84%
that don't have any real
specific cause and actually most

00:28:03.449 --> 00:28:07.553 align:middle line:84%
of the consultations for GPs
are for those kinds of issues

00:28:07.553 --> 00:28:11.257 align:middle line:84%
and they're not on the whole
for your accident emergency

00:28:11.257 --> 00:28:14.193 align:middle line:84%
or in a big trauma medicine
or even big disease medicine.

00:28:14.193 --> 00:28:18.631 align:middle line:84%
Most doctors' appointments
in the UK are for things

00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:20.366 align:middle line:84%
that are much more
difficult to pin down.

00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:23.269 align:middle line:84%
And in a seven to eight minute
consultation session you're

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.005 align:middle line:84%
really fighting against
making a change.

00:28:26.005 --> 00:28:29.942 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting
that medicine

00:28:29.942 --> 00:28:32.578 align:middle line:84%
and science is still seen
as being that's where you go

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:35.614 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you do
when actually it has failed

00:28:35.614 --> 00:28:37.316 align:middle line:84%
to produce answers
in so many areas.

00:28:37.316 --> 00:28:39.685 align:middle line:84%
And that's not having
a go at medicine.

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:41.587 align:middle line:90%
In some areas it does amazing in

00:28:41.587 --> 00:28:44.156 align:middle line:84%
but most doctors I know would
admit there are certain areas

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:47.026 align:middle line:84%
we're just not very good at
because we don't have the time

00:28:47.026 --> 00:28:48.294 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really
our training.

00:28:48.294 --> 00:28:49.795 align:middle line:84%
It's not what they're
trained to do.

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:51.497 align:middle line:90%
Their training is very specific

00:28:51.497 --> 00:28:53.532 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really
generally based

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
in helping people make
change in their lives.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do you go
into the gratitude

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.974 align:middle line:90%
and into the compassion?

00:29:01.974 --> 00:29:03.609 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: Yeah, I mean part

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:06.078 align:middle line:84%
of the lightning
process is there's a step

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:08.647 align:middle line:84%
within the lightning process
which is called the coach.

00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:13.018 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is and this again
is in the Life You Love book.

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:84%
You move from having a
conversation between you

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.322 align:middle line:84%
in the pit where
you're just talking

00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:18.691 align:middle line:84%
about shit all the
time basically.

00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.393 align:middle line:84%
You know the kind of
conversations we all have

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:26.031 align:middle line:84%
from time to time that don't
enhance our lives but they seem

00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:28.667 align:middle line:84%
to take a lot of brain
space, a lot of time.

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:31.971 align:middle line:84%
We stop that and then we
say well, unless we replace

00:29:31.971 --> 00:29:33.305 align:middle line:84%
that with something guess
what we're going to do?

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go back into
having those conversations.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:84%
So we create a structure where
you create new conversations

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.179 align:middle line:90%
between you and your coach.

00:29:40.179 --> 00:29:41.547 align:middle line:90%
So we generate a coach.

00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:44.016 align:middle line:84%
You train yourself
to talk to yourself

00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:47.219 align:middle line:84%
in a very particular way using
the concepts of coaching.

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:49.922 align:middle line:84%
So it's a self-coaching process
which makes it very unique

00:29:49.922 --> 00:29:52.424 align:middle line:84%
because it really gives
you the power back instead

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.993 align:middle line:90%
of the therapist fixing you.

00:29:53.993 --> 00:29:58.264 align:middle line:84%
It's like no, we're training you
in these skills so you can start

00:29:58.264 --> 00:30:01.033 align:middle line:84%
to really reroute your
brain and get things moving.

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:03.636 align:middle line:84%
You see another interesting
thing you might like to note

00:30:03.636 --> 00:30:06.772 align:middle line:84%
which is if everyone
watching, you can try this out.

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:09.308 align:middle line:84%
If you take your right
foot and you wiggle it

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:13.145 align:middle line:84%
in a clockwise, let
me show you, way.

00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:18.884 align:middle line:84%
And then, draw a six
with your right hand.

00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:25.491 align:middle line:84%
Notice what happens to
your foot when you do that?

00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:26.725 align:middle line:90%
So that's neuroplasticity.

00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:29.461 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere along the
way your brain wired

00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:90%
up two pieces of information.

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And the way neuroplasticity
works is it says,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.303 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to use a pathway
a lot I'll make it quicker

00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:38.504 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:40.372 align:middle line:84%
So if you use a pathway
that continually takes you

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:44.009 align:middle line:84%
into bad ways of thinking it
actually makes those nerves get

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:45.077 align:middle line:90%
closer together.

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:47.313 align:middle line:84%
So there's less of a
gap for them to jump

00:30:47.313 --> 00:30:50.316 align:middle line:84%
and the pathways you don't use,
so the pathways of calm start

00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:51.817 align:middle line:90%
to become farther apart.

00:30:51.817 --> 00:30:55.921 align:middle line:84%
So if you're using a pathway a
lot it becomes stronger and one

00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:57.122 align:middle line:84%
of the things you've got
to do if you're going

00:30:57.122 --> 00:30:59.124 align:middle line:84%
to make lasting change is
you've got to change it

00:30:59.124 --> 00:31:00.526 align:middle line:90%
so that the stress pathways

00:31:00.526 --> 00:31:02.928 align:middle line:84%
or the negative pathways
get farther apart

00:31:02.928 --> 00:31:06.231 align:middle line:84%
from the original nerve and the
happiness pathways get closer.

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:08.734 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this change
happening within days.

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:10.636 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
see the nerves move,

00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:12.638 align:middle line:90%
they physically move position.

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.873 align:middle line:84%
So with the lightning process
what we're doing is training

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.742 align:middle line:84%
people out of one set
of ways of thinking

00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:20.980 align:middle line:84%
into something much more
interesting and a core part

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.615 align:middle line:84%
of that is developing
compassion.

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:26.986 align:middle line:84%
So the first step of that
coaching is to be nice,

00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:30.656 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge, to thank, to
tell you, well the phrase we use

00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:31.957 align:middle line:84%
in the lightning
process and also

00:31:31.957 --> 00:31:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Life You Love
book is we get people

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.763 align:middle line:84%
to say you are a
powerful genius.

00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:40.099 align:middle line:84%
And we explain why that
is within the book.

00:31:40.099 --> 00:31:43.702 align:middle line:84%
But acknowledging that we are
extraordinary, we are the peak

00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:46.271 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, we're incredible,
we have the potential

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.439 align:middle line:90%
to do just about anything.

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.541 align:middle line:84%
The problem is this
cuts both ways.

00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:52.544 align:middle line:84%
If we're a genius and
we are and so are you.

00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:56.615 align:middle line:84%
If we're all geniuses, if you
take a genius mind and get it

00:31:56.615 --> 00:31:59.451 align:middle line:84%
to do something really, really
bad it will do it brilliantly.

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:03.689 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be really,
really good at stress,

00:32:03.689 --> 00:32:05.457 align:middle line:84%
if you have a genius
mind which we all do

00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:07.793 align:middle line:84%
because we are amazing
humans you can be really good

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:09.028 align:middle line:90%
at stress.

00:32:09.028 --> 00:32:10.729 align:middle line:84%
You could be like an Olympic
gold medalist at stress

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and I certainly know some people
who are that good at stress

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that if there was an Olympic
sport they would be on the team.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
to harness that genius

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.742 align:middle line:84%
to something more
interesting, more life enhancing

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:29.481 align:middle line:84%
and then you have-- if you think
about it, those people you know

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:34.053 align:middle line:84%
who are somehow unconsciously
doing depression or upset

00:32:34.053 --> 00:32:37.056 align:middle line:84%
or sadness or stuck they don't
know how they're doing it

00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:38.023 align:middle line:90%
but they are good at it.

00:32:38.023 --> 00:32:39.391 align:middle line:84%
They are really phenomenally
good.

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:40.492 align:middle line:90%
You can show them lots

00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:43.328 align:middle line:84%
of reasons why their
life could be better.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:45.164 align:middle line:84%
Look at-- you've got
a lovely boyfriend.

00:32:45.164 --> 00:32:47.399 align:middle line:84%
You've got a bank
balance with money in it.

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got children
who love you.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.303 align:middle line:90%
Nothing makes any difference.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:55.607 align:middle line:84%
They're able to turn that
information and make it mush.

00:32:55.607 --> 00:32:59.211 align:middle line:84%
If they could do the same
with bad information,

00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.413 align:middle line:84%
if they could take bad
information and turn

00:33:01.413 --> 00:33:03.882 align:middle line:84%
that into nothing and
focus on great information

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:06.318 align:middle line:84%
about how good they are their
lives would be transformed.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:07.719 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
how to switch that.

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:10.055 align:middle line:84%
And the lightning process and
the Life You Love Now talks all

00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:13.192 align:middle line:84%
about that, how you
switch from being a genius

00:33:13.192 --> 00:33:16.195 align:middle line:84%
at something dreadful to being
a genius at something fantastic.

00:33:16.195 --> 00:33:18.897 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're a
genius you can be a genius

00:33:18.897 --> 00:33:20.933 align:middle line:90%
at anything you want to be.

00:33:20.933 --> 00:33:23.969 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Inaudible] here he's
using the term how does it get

00:33:23.969 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:90%
any better than this?

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.039 align:middle line:84%
You know being in this
questions learn something

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.208 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
at too aren't you?

00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:33.178 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Absolutely, rather
than going for yes, okay.

00:33:33.178 --> 00:33:38.117 align:middle line:84%
One of the swear words
the F-word is fine.

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:38.617 align:middle line:90%
How is it?

00:33:38.617 --> 00:33:39.384 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.652 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you want.

00:33:40.652 --> 00:33:43.956 align:middle line:84%
You don't want at the end,
as they wheel your coffin

00:33:43.956 --> 00:33:48.093 align:middle line:84%
into a church and the person
gives the memorial service says,

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:50.028 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah, they had a
life that was fine.

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.897 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, their job was fine.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:53.265 align:middle line:90%
The kids were fine."

00:33:53.265 --> 00:33:55.567 align:middle line:90%
That's not what you want.

00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:56.135 align:middle line:90%
"It was awesome.

00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:57.369 align:middle line:90%
It was great."

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:02.141 align:middle line:84%
You want to have every
day like a party.

00:34:02.141 --> 00:34:05.811 align:middle line:84%
I often say life is too
short for bad cocktails.

00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:08.013 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure if
you're having a cocktail it's a

00:34:08.013 --> 00:34:08.714 align:middle line:90%
good cocktail.

00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:10.414 align:middle line:90%
It's a great cocktail.

00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:11.917 align:middle line:90%
You want to live life like that.

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:12.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Same as wine, huh?

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.019 align:middle line:90%
I would say that to the British?

00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:14.952 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: Yeah.

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:15.988 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
drink bad wine.

00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:17.689 align:middle line:90%
That's a waste.

00:34:17.689 --> 00:34:20.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Usually in pubs.

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:22.794 align:middle line:84%
Do you have anything else
that you would like to say,

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:26.999 align:middle line:84%
a part of this conversation,
a message, some advice?

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:30.903 align:middle line:90%
>> PP: So many things to say.

00:34:30.903 --> 00:34:37.843 align:middle line:84%
I mean my core principle
would be, be happy.

00:34:37.843 --> 00:34:39.945 align:middle line:90%
Find ways to be happy.

00:34:39.945 --> 00:34:43.148 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is being
talked about more

00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:84%
but it seems a bit
of a soft topic.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.084 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, that would be nice.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.053 align:middle line:84%
It's not nice it's
essential actually.

00:34:48.053 --> 00:34:51.856 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the most defining
factors of a great life,

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:56.595 align:middle line:84%
of a successful, fulfilled and
a long-lived, healthy life.

00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:59.264 align:middle line:84%
And considering those are
things we most value, yeah,

00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:02.734 align:middle line:84%
people value money until
they're ill and then they go,

00:35:02.734 --> 00:35:05.003 align:middle line:84%
actually I really
value health now.

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:06.371 align:middle line:90%
One of the things we lose

00:35:06.371 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
and that's not saying money
isn't something everybody wants.

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.378 align:middle line:84%
The research suggests we
all want money but it gets

00:35:13.378 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we have enough

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and having more doesn't
actually make us any happier.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.252 align:middle line:84%
Equally, if you live on
the street under a bridge

00:35:20.252 --> 00:35:22.187 align:middle line:84%
and you have no money that's
not great for you either.

00:35:22.187 --> 00:35:23.388 align:middle line:90%
It's somewhere in the middle

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:25.858 align:middle line:84%
but the more happiness
you have the better.

00:35:25.858 --> 00:35:27.559 align:middle line:90%
You can't have enough happiness.

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:31.029 align:middle line:84%
It's a defining factor that if
you have happiness then actually

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.732 align:middle line:84%
everything else becomes
brighter and lighter.

00:35:33.732 --> 00:35:35.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Well, that's
what I love about people

00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:84%
on Gaiam TV they're
looking for happiness.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.105 align:middle line:84%
You know they have all
those videos and access

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:43.108 align:middle line:84%
to all these things too make
their people because we have

00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:44.409 align:middle line:90%
to invest in happiness, huh?

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:48.814 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's a time looking
at videos, reading books,

00:35:48.814 --> 00:35:52.284 align:middle line:84%
going to seminars and
it's important to see

00:35:52.284 --> 00:35:53.552 align:middle line:90%
where we come from huh?

00:35:53.552 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Just kind of check in.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.256 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: I think it's
also important one

00:35:57.256 --> 00:35:59.658 align:middle line:84%
of the things I see a lot is
people spend a lot of time going

00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:03.829 align:middle line:84%
to seminars, reading books and
that's great but you've also got

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:90%
to put it into practice.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.098 align:middle line:90%
You've got to actually be happy.

00:36:06.098 --> 00:36:08.567 align:middle line:84%
So when I've read that
book then I'll be happy.

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:84%
No, be happy now because
the other core thing

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.939 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't really talked
about in the lightning process

00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:15.974 align:middle line:84%
and the Life You Love Now
is about being present,

00:36:15.974 --> 00:36:18.577 align:middle line:84%
being here now because
that's all there is.

00:36:18.577 --> 00:36:22.547 align:middle line:84%
And when I kind of thought
about this I wasn't aware

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.583 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddhist teachings that
say exactly the same thing,

00:36:24.583 --> 00:36:25.918 align:middle line:90%
but this is what I came across.

00:36:25.918 --> 00:36:28.887 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the one thing
that is most important is

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:32.591 align:middle line:84%
to actually be present, to
just tune in to where we are

00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and quite often when people make
the changes that we have them

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.728 align:middle line:84%
to make-- I got a
beautiful letter today

00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:40.399 align:middle line:84%
from somebody whose little boy
who had been in chronic pain was

00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:43.135 align:middle line:84%
on morphine which you
don't want when you're 11,

00:36:43.135 --> 00:36:46.405 align:middle line:84%
and the pain hadn't been
touched by the morphine,

00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:48.573 align:middle line:84%
did the lightning proceeding
and now he's learning to,

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.676 align:middle line:84%
he thinks he's going to
be championship boxer.

00:36:50.676 --> 00:36:53.478 align:middle line:84%
So he's like, he's back
to health and fitness

00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:56.214 align:middle line:84%
and being punched and in no
pain or the same amount of pain

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.116 align:middle line:90%
as he would after being hit

00:36:58.116 --> 00:37:00.886 align:middle line:84%
but he's completely
functioning normally.

00:37:00.886 --> 00:37:02.888 align:middle line:90%
And when people get well one

00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:05.891 align:middle line:84%
of the things they often say
is it's great to be well.

00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:07.292 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be happy.

00:37:07.292 --> 00:37:10.562 align:middle line:84%
One thing I notice is I notice
the trees and I notice the birds

00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:15.233 align:middle line:84%
and I notice my kids and I'm
breathing and I become aware

00:37:15.233 --> 00:37:17.035 align:middle line:84%
of that moment and I
talk about it in the book

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:19.104 align:middle line:84%
that very often we're
not present and the kind

00:37:19.104 --> 00:37:22.307 align:middle line:84%
of times we are present is
in those momentous events

00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:24.142 align:middle line:84%
like when somebody
has a kid, a new baby.

00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Wow, got a baby and then they
go home from the hospital

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.749 align:middle line:84%
or they go out for the first
time and everyone else seems

00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
to be carrying on like
nothing's happened,

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.554 align:middle line:84%
like they're just
going to work and going

00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:39.524 align:middle line:84%
to Starbucks eating their
food and I've got a baby.

00:37:39.524 --> 00:37:40.859 align:middle line:90%
The world should be stopped.

00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.528 align:middle line:84%
This is such a momentous event
and it's in those moments

00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:84%
when we're actually present
or another example is

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:51.003 align:middle line:84%
when you have a near
accident or near bad diagnosis

00:37:51.003 --> 00:37:54.639 align:middle line:84%
and you survive and you
suddenly realize how great it is

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to be alive again.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What a
gift, what a miracle.

00:37:57.509 --> 00:38:00.545 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Yeah, but we shouldn't
rely on those momentous events

00:38:00.545 --> 00:38:03.014 align:middle line:84%
to get us back in touch with
what it's like to be present.

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Those are the times
when we most notice it

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.153 align:middle line:90%
but what would it be like.

00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:09.755 align:middle line:84%
Like that question you
were asking, what more?

00:38:09.755 --> 00:38:12.057 align:middle line:84%
What would it be like
if we could actually be

00:38:12.057 --> 00:38:15.761 align:middle line:84%
in the present, in the
moment, in this moment, now,

00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:18.463 align:middle line:90%
here ongoingly, what then?

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.165 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of the
stress for instance,

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:23.068 align:middle line:84%
stress is not a present
moment then phenomenon.

00:38:23.068 --> 00:38:25.504 align:middle line:84%
It's all about what
will happen next?

00:38:25.504 --> 00:38:28.206 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is all about
the future tense.

00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:29.174 align:middle line:84%
We're note stressed
about the past.

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:30.675 align:middle line:84%
We can't be stressed
about the past.

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.978 align:middle line:84%
We can be regretful,
remorseful and guilty.

00:38:32.978 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We can't be stressed
about the past.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.715 align:middle line:84%
We can do stressed
about the consequences

00:38:36.715 --> 00:38:38.383 align:middle line:90%
into the future of that past.

00:38:38.383 --> 00:38:40.986 align:middle line:84%
So being in the present
actually allow us

00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to suddenly just put aside those
conversations about the past

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.158 align:middle line:90%
which are mainly irrelevant

00:38:46.158 --> 00:38:48.293 align:middle line:84%
because the past doesn't even
exist anymore and the future

00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:50.162 align:middle line:90%
which is yet designed by us.

00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:51.997 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, being present
is actually essential.

00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:55.267 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because we can't
really control other people

00:38:55.267 --> 00:38:56.368 align:middle line:90%
or change them.

00:38:56.368 --> 00:38:58.403 align:middle line:84%
Well there's only, we
have a feeling, oh,

00:38:58.403 --> 00:39:01.306 align:middle line:84%
this person is doing that
on me but no, no, no.

00:39:01.306 --> 00:39:03.442 align:middle line:84%
>> PP: Yeah, in the
book I say trying

00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:05.477 align:middle line:84%
to change another
person is like trying

00:39:05.477 --> 00:39:07.879 align:middle line:84%
to change the weather,
it's just ridiculous.

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:08.647 align:middle line:90%
We've all tried it.

00:39:08.647 --> 00:39:09.347 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:10.715 align:middle line:90%
We should get over it.

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:14.319 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to deal with
ourselves not try and find a way

00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:15.887 align:middle line:90%
to change other people.

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Well, thank you so
much Phil for, soon Dr. Phil

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:20.492 align:middle line:90%
for this delicious conversation.

00:39:20.492 --> 00:39:23.462 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate that and
my delicious co-creators

00:39:23.462 --> 00:39:29.334 align:middle line:84%
out there send you
much love from London.
