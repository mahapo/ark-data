00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.410 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Boulder,
Colorado for part two.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Because our conversation the
other day with Robert Ohotto

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.020 align:middle line:84%
was so juicy, so fulfilling
I wanted to get more of him.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure you do, too.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
So, as you might remember, he is
this intuitive life strategist.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:10%
He wrote this wonderful book
called "Transforming Faith

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:10%
into Destiny."

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to watch
this other video.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really,
thick, dense, amazing.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:90%
And light and wonderful.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:90%
Very practical.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We left this conversation
talking of authenticity.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I would love if you can
summarize just a little bit

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.058 align:middle line:84%
before we get into this
authentic conversation.

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to go on
a safari of consciousness.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:04.932 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:10%
We're going to get
there co-creators.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Because this has to be tangible.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.092 align:middle line:90%
This has to be embodied.

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT OHOTTO: Right.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Because this is time.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:90%
The time is now, isn't it?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a good
point about destiny.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
lived on the Earth.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot
of times we, right?

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: But a lot
of us think, like,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:10%
it's something I have to do
that gets me off the Earth,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: But I think that
you're here to engage.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is all God.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:10%
So you're going to rock
it here or you're not

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:10%
rocking it anywhere.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.113 align:middle line:84%
So it's how do you rock
it while you're here

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:37.107 align:middle line:90%
and bring your juiciness--

00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah!

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Forward and
live it in the world.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And give your gifts.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And connect.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.295 align:middle line:90%
And make connections.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:42.349 align:middle line:90%
And serve other people.

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy to continue
that conversation.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.455 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Because
that's kind of,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, all this inner
work, what's it for?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: What's it for?

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean if it's
coming from shame,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
then it's to get
out of a lifetime.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Or fix yourself.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Or redeem yourself
with some wrathful God.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But if that's not
true, then what

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:90%
are you doing your work for?

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen in my field
in terms of working intuitively

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:84%
with people and
tracking their psyche.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.924 align:middle line:84%
And entering into that
space and that territory

00:02:07.924 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you're here
to make connections.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.094 align:middle line:84%
You're here to serve others
and connect with them

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
through your talents,
your gifts, your skills.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And your authenticity.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Until we're hiding some stuff
and thinking of ourselves

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're not good
enough, and less than,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and comparing, and being
in this competitive world,

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and being shameful
of those things,

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.600 align:middle line:90%
we're never going to thrive.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:90%
And as a society either.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.945 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's a huge
shift to be made, right?

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I would even
say it differently.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.243 align:middle line:84%
I would say you're
not going to thrive

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:90%
until you accept even that.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all going
to be bouncing around

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.500 align:middle line:84%
in our insecurity and
comparing ourselves.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go compare myself
in five minutes to somebody.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.445 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So how about we just
learn how to be with it.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.024 align:middle line:84%
And then if we are with
it, maybe just maybe,

00:02:46.024 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
say, we're going

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.981 align:middle line:84%
to get a conscious
choice out of that

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.477 align:middle line:90%
on how to engage with our heart.

00:02:50.477 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: That's the goal.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.295 align:middle line:10%
Because, you know,
your heart shuts down

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:10%
when you're in comparison mode.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're in that
shame-based mode.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But to really love
yourself unconditionally

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.429 align:middle line:84%
with unconditional
presence, you have

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.845 align:middle line:84%
to be OK with the
part of you that

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:90%
does the comparing and all that.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.199 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to enfold
that into the love.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So once you do that,
I think you start

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to land in what authenticity
is really about.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: How do you define it?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.049 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I think
it's, you know,

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.445 align:middle line:84%
the Greeks called
it authenticos.

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's this
idea of authority,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and writing your own story,
and being able to-- I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.607 align:middle line:84%
would say, how does
that look in this life?

00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It looks like being able
to make conscious choice.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.189 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So what does that look
like on a given day?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, you stay and
you cultivate OK-ness.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
You have a crap day,
something triggers you,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
you're OK with it.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to like it.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to like stuff.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't a fake it til
you make it, Mary Kay like it.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, I
never understood that.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.333 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: This is I
don't really like this,

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to accept it.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And acceptance
doesn't mean you like things.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.792 align:middle line:84%
So if you can do that,
though, and the more

00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're able to,
the more that you're

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
going to stop fighting
your own experience.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And authenticity
to me is you being

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
present to your experience in
the moment without condition.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Like I am just here.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.949 align:middle line:84%
I'm just this dude sitting
here, having this experience

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:84%
of the moment without
any conditions.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.226 align:middle line:90%
I can just be me.

00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And if that means,
you know what,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.025 align:middle line:84%
you did something that just
pissed me off, or made me sad,

00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:90%
or I just lost my dog.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.539 align:middle line:84%
Well, then your
experience is you're sad.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.704 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But how about if
the sadness lasts too long

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're just stuck
there and depressed?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Well, I've
seen that people

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
think that's some
type-- it's like grief,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
for example, is what
you're talking about,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.450 align:middle line:90%
has its own cycle.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't tell
someone who lost their wife,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
or their husband, or partner,
or animal, get over it,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%
it's been a month.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to let your
own heart negotiate

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
the process of
loss and grieving.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
that you just allow,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.444 align:middle line:84%
it just somehow one day you're
like, I'm not so sad today.

00:04:40.444 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because we hold
onto stuff, don't we?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah and
then it's like you're

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
fighting your own experience.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
If your experience
is loss and sadness,

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%
that's your experience.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean you like it.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.933 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: There's a payoff.

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.897 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: But it is part of the
textures of OK-ness of living.

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And it can be,
anyway, if you let it be.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:10%
And authenticity can
emerge in that sense of I'm

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:10%
just going to be present with
my first genuine response

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:10%
to the moment.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It's amazing how when
one person is authentic or when

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:10%
we are authentic, we
feel the body expand.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:10%
There's a certain
experience in the body.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is like an amazing
temple, an amazing tool,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:15.707 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:05:15.707 --> 00:05:17.415 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: It's like
an intuitive antenna.

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.028 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And so what people
tend to do is they will,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll kind of tune out
of their own antenna.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.585 align:middle line:84%
Think about the things
we do in our culture.

00:05:23.585 --> 00:05:25.090 align:middle line:10%
You know, if we're
sad, we take a pill.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:10%
If we're anxious,
we take a pill.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm being extreme,
but I'm just making a point.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: And I'm
not saying there's

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:10%
anything wrong
with that, per se.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes you need
to take a pill.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, you know what I mean?

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
metabolize your life?

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:10%
How do you let
life into yourself?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:10%
And what are the conditions
that you'll put up and say,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.119 align:middle line:10%
I won't metabolize this,
but it's already there.

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're either going
to let it in or not.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Or fight or resist
your experience or not.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to suggest,
energetically, the more

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that you allow your experience
to be what it actually

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
is, let it in, you get moved by
greater forces, your intuition,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
by your guidance
squad, by your own life

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:90%
force to the next thing.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't mentalize or deny
and strategize grief away.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: It's not like you're
being 100% responsible either.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.499 align:middle line:10%
It's different.

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: There's
accountability and then there's

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.365 align:middle line:10%
responsibility.

00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, so you're
accountable, for example,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
to your choices you
make because they all

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
have karmic consequences.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's a technical
phenomena to me.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.129 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't make you bad
person if you choose something

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:10%
and it crash and burns.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all have that happen.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But that's just the
technical level of the karma.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And karma is something
that's even, that said,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:90%
outside of your own control.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
For example, I think a lot
of us would look something

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
like an event like 9/11 and if
we were to really take a bigger

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
picture step back at the
karmic nature of that event,

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:90%
that event was set in motion.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because if you
watch there's a lot of TV shows

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.045 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of books
been written by people

00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:56.503 align:middle line:84%
that lost loved
ones in that event.

00:06:56.503 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I personally was part
of that event at the time.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I worked for American Airlines.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I was a flight attendant
based in Boston.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oh la la.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And we were
coming in off of an aircraft

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
the night before from
San Diego to Boston.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And I still lived in Chicago.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So I commuted from
Boston to Chicago.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:90%
You gotta track this.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We had a code word that we
would use if we were hijacked.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I was working first class,
because that's how I roll.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.689 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Man!

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.575 align:middle line:90%
This guy's got some--

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I was
up in first class

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is back when you could
draw the opaque curtain, right?

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:84%
There was an opaque
curtain between cabins.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And this flight attendant
from coach came up

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and she used the code word
out of the blue of hijacking.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:90%
This is the night before 9/11.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
That event was in the
psychic field karmically

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
long before those
guys got on the plane.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I went to flight
attendant training

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
with somebody who died in the
plane that hit the first tower.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.207 align:middle line:84%
And a colleague of mine
that I flew with later

00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
was with him that morning as
he was boarding that flight

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.373 align:middle line:84%
and he was depressed
and he didn't know why.

00:07:56.373 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a guy that
was gregarious and funny.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.189 align:middle line:84%
And she went up to him and she
said, what's wrong with you?

00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:03.896 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I don't
know, there's just

00:08:03.896 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:90%
something really wrong.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So this flight attendant
comes up the night

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
before, I'm on the
flight, and she

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.514 align:middle line:84%
uses this code
word for hijacking.

00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that alerted me and I went,
why did you just say that?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm starting to
think are we being hijacked.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.415 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You don't joke
about these kind of things.

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: You do not.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I don't even
know why I just said that.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.832 align:middle line:84%
And that, I intuitively
went, something's up.

00:08:21.832 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking
about what would I

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.706 align:middle line:90%
do if there was a hijacking.

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, flash forward,
the next day,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm waking up in Chicago
having flown in, commuted

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:10%
in from the night,
and 9/11's happening.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:10%
And what I intuitively
feel about that event

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:10%
karmically, for example,
is that the forces that

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:10%
set that event in
motion were hundreds

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.831 align:middle line:10%
of years in the making.

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
On the level of Earth school,
on the level of the patterns,

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
on the level of the god,
my god, my Islamic god

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.039 align:middle line:84%
versus your Christian
god, those were

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of years in the
making that led to that event.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
People look at it as, oh, this
just happened out of the blue.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:54.865 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand karma.

00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You don't understand karma then.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Those forces-- so
karma is impersonal.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's also human in that
sense of the psychic field

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and how things
move and how things happen here.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.975 align:middle line:90%
So look at choice.

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
If you bring shame
to it, you think

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a sense of
hyper responsibility.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
could make a decision,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
but there's other forces set in
motion maybe hundreds of years

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
ago already influencing
what the karmic consequence

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:90%
of your choice will be.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: You can't-- it's
enormous to understand

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.352 align:middle line:90%
the hologram of energy in that.

00:09:28.352 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at this
from the point of view

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
of choice and
empowerment and destiny.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And from an
intuitive perspective, too.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: An
intuitive perspective.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because
this is awesome.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're talking on
the practical level here.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.706 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Right.

00:09:38.706 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Practical level.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to do your best.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Come from your truest
intention, come

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
from your heart, and the rest
is up to the gods, if you will.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.773 align:middle line:90%
Or up to life.

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Or up to the other karmic forces
that you don't even know about.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, and that's where, I
mean, I'm guilty of this, too,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
like we get so
frustrated with timing.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
We want things to happen now.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oh, but that's doubt.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: But it's
also a sense of urgency

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.352 align:middle line:84%
that can also be you
saying to the universe,

00:10:00.352 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
believe this'll ever

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
happen for me because
you don't love me enough.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have
to make it happen.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, it's this law of--

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.775 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: But that's
paradigm shift, isn't it?

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.799 align:middle line:10%
This is the paradigm
shift, it's beginning

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:15.409 align:middle line:10%
to say, look, what's destined
for me, it's on, man.

00:10:15.409 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:90%
This is going to happen for me.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I will not be blocked from
giving my grace to life.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- anything
else is an illusion.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
If you believe anything,
I will not be blocked.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The doors that are meant to
open for me, they're opening.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.402 align:middle line:84%
The doors that are meant to
shut for me, they're shutting.

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, it goes both ways.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
But I will not be-- it's not all
on every single micro choice I

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
make whether or not I fulfill
a sense of grace delivery

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, doors open for me
that I could have never planned.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, there's kind
of like this existence,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.982 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and like
this bliss, isn't there?

00:10:54.982 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: This is the thing
about the destined life, right?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so dynamic, there's
so many levels and layers.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.845 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the truest
compass is your authenticity.

00:11:03.845 --> 00:11:05.449 align:middle line:90%
The truest compass is this.

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things I
would say about authenticity

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
is if you move from let's say
your urgency to get worthiness,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:90%
then you won't be nourished.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an insecure ambition.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.507 align:middle line:84%
Insecure ambition
is always going

00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to be attached to outcome.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Because that outcome has
to give you worthiness.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It has to validate you.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're moving
from that place in life,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:90%
it's like chasing a carrot.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And even if you get the
carrot, it's allusive.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Because my point being
you never get down

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:10%
to eating a nourishing
meal of living

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.352 align:middle line:10%
a loving and
self-appreciated life.

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you're always feeling
like worthiness is out there,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I gotta go get it
and make it happen.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Versus I move from
power and worthiness

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.945 align:middle line:84%
and therefore I'm not in
servitude, I'm in service.

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:90%
You know that other--

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Very different.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: --way of
going is insecure.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.439 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because it feels
we're slaves of our own lives.

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:10%
I mean this is really feels like
this is part of the paradigm

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:10%
shift, breaking free
from those chains.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.462 align:middle line:10%
They're invisible,
but they're there.

00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: They're
there and they're

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.050 align:middle line:10%
very insidious
and sometimes very

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.150 align:middle line:10%
hard to detect because
of it's so natural for us

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:10%
to default to shame.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And to default to I'm not
worthy, I'm not good enough.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.790 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of what we know.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:10%
So to really live in a
different zone of real true,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and how do you
get to worthiness?

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean how do you
actually get there?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think it's
like Buddha saying,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
you know what, you're already
enlightened, just wake up.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:90%
That's it, wake up.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
You know there's nothing
to do for worthiness.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to
be for worthiness.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.517 align:middle line:84%
If you leave that truth,
now you're in duality.

00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in the
right, wrong choice.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:10%
Now you're in the if I
don't make this choice,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.078 align:middle line:10%
if this doesn't happen for
me, then all bets are off.

00:12:52.078 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:10%
My destiny's lost.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:10%
There's no truth in that at all.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:10%
There's higher forces.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:10%
Everyone has, I call
it your guidance squad.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Like this team.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: How about angels?

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Same thing, really.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.396 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Just how I
like to look at it.

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Like this team of peeps.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual peeps around
you in the energy world.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Watching out for you, speaking
through your intuition,

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:90%
guiding you along.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Helping you feel
your choices and make

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:90%
choices that serve your truth.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how can
we start communicating

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
or having their help?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I'll tell you one of
the first things you got to do,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
you have to be willing
to feel your feelings.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't willing
to feel their feelings

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:25.950 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
They're conditional
with how they feel.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But you know, who wants to
sit down and feel anxiety?

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.826 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I have enough of that.

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Or fear.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, yeah,
can I just sit down

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and feel some fear for a while?

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But my point being, the
more unconditionally

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
you can be with your feelings,
the more unconditional

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:90%
you can be with your guidance.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: So then your intuition
can flow more directly.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Because your feelings are
part of your intuitive system.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to locate
destiny, or destined,

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
or truth choices, or the next
true choice for themselves,

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:90%
what do you feel?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:58.849 align:middle line:90%
Start with--

00:13:58.849 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: The heart?

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.345 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Move
out of here, down.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd even say, like, how do
your feet feel about it?

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
How does your butt feel about
what you're going to do?

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: That's a good one.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.526 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Right?

00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do your arms feel?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Tune in to the rest of you.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Because you are this
energetic antenna.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.959 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: And when you're up
in the either/or thinking,

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:17.250 align:middle line:10%
you're not going to get useful
information or guidance.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:10%
It's all either/or,
it's all black or white,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:10%
it's all I'm wrong or right.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.360 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.644 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah, so it's a
shift of matter to energy.

00:14:23.644 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: You could look
at it that way, yeah.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a shift from--
into the emotional--

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Or fear to love.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Emotional body.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Emotional body.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah,
the emotional body.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But you know fear
sometimes is guidance too.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I live in Boulder where we have
mountain lions in my backyard.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I have rattlesnakes.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:90%
I have coyote packs.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Right.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I mean so I'm glad I'm
a little afraid sometimes when

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%
I take my dog out at night.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Fear is not a bad thing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.532 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But you're not
shaking or in such a trance

00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can't, you're
not present to it.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:84%
You're like OK, I'm not
going to go out there.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: There's real
fear which guides you.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
trauma fear which

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.590 align:middle line:10%
is fear that's been
the byproduct of trauma

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:10%
from the past that's not real.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.650 align:middle line:10%
You know, and that's when
you're afraid of something

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.060 align:middle line:10%
that actually isn't threatening.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.089 align:middle line:84%
It's like your body having a
histamine reaction to pollen.

00:15:07.089 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Pollen's not going to hurt you.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Your body's mistaking
it as if it would.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we have an
allergic reaction;

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.320 align:middle line:84%
our body generates its defenses
and the immune system amps up.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.969 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of fear
that's a toxic level of fear.

00:15:21.969 --> 00:15:23.010 align:middle line:90%
But there's healthy fear.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:10%
You know, I'm glad I'm
afraid of mountain lions.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:10%
Just saying.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.673 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So in the
part one, we talked

00:15:27.673 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:10%
of the shadow work and the
solace team and all of that.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But really I feel, I mean
what's your forte obviously,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:90%
you're an intuitive.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And here we're speaking
of authenticity

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:10%
because the more
we're authentic,

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:10%
the more we're really
hearing this clear

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:10%
it becomes really pure then.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a really, it's a
really quick, how does it--

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.840 align:middle line:10%
because we hear some
people are clairvoyant,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:10%
other-- what is the difference?

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: I think your intuition
can speak to you in many ways.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:10%
A lot of us have a
particular kind of forte.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:10%
So I'm very claircognizant,
I just know stuff.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
But I also feel things.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.099 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of mix both together.

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that I
would also add to that

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is no matter what
your forte is, you

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
have to look at what is eating
up your bandwidth of guidance.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.282 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a trauma
that hasn't been resolved,

00:16:17.282 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
well, your guidance
is going to get

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
filtered through that trauma.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.809 align:middle line:84%
You know, for example,
there was a psychic

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I knew once who
would read people

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and she would tell them if
their parents were abusive

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.115 align:middle line:84%
that their mother or
father was a dark spirit.

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wait
a minute, my father

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
was insanely abusive to me.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Like he threatened
my life a few times,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
tried to shoot me with a gun.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went
through some crap.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Wow.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And I never saw
my father as a dark spirit,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I saw him as a wounded man.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And someone who was in pain.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:90%
But not a dark spirit.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Right.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.243 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: And so I can see that.

00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
I can perceive that that way
because I'm not cluttering up

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
bandwidth with
victim consciousness.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, right,
wrong, good, or bad.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:90%
And you're evil or good.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not in that paradigm.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:90%
That's not where I live.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.883 align:middle line:84%
That's not where I read
soul contracts from.

00:16:55.883 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Because we just are living.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.205 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're just having
experiences in awakening.

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's no right
or wrong or good about it

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:90%
really at the end of the day.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.538 align:middle line:84%
There's pain and
suffering, there's

00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:84%
disconnection and
connection, maybe perhaps.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, if you want clarity,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:90%
what clutters up your bandwidth.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you start to
go what trauma would create

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.203 align:middle line:84%
a filter of
perception in my life.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
You know, like that psychic.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.035 align:middle line:84%
She would never be
able to read somebody

00:17:21.035 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of clarity of
what was the soul contract.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The soul agreement in some
way to experience maybe abuse

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.202 align:middle line:84%
or absorb pain from this parent
and transmute or transform it

00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:90%
to destiny.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.122 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because you have
to hear beyond the chatter.

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
The chatting earthy thing.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess you kind of
raise your vibration.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.312 align:middle line:10%
Can we say that?

00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: I think it's
about, shadow work

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.440 align:middle line:10%
is actually going down though.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm going to
go down into the dark.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.199 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, but for
you to hear the up.

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Oh, yeah for when
I do a reading on somebody,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:90%
there is a vibrational shift.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
I actually get hot and I feel
my nervous system amp up.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I get, actually,
I sometimes have

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to walk around a
little bit because I

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:84%
feel this voltage
kind of coming in.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.875 align:middle line:84%
That's in like if I'm reading
someone's soul contract.

00:17:58.875 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Wow

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And there's different
levels of reading, I think,

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.449 align:middle line:90%
we can engage in.

00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:02.031 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:18:02.031 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: That's a whole other
kind of level of intuition.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I think there's different
types of intuition.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Because those
antennas, some people

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
say they're out so much
that it's draining them.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And you have to kind of learn.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Some shut their power.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah, to boot down.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
To take your receptivity down.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's happened.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
That's something I've had to
continually practice and master

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
for myself so that I can stay
in my personal zone, as well.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness,
there's some energy

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.055 align:middle line:90%
vampires out there, aren't they?

00:18:33.055 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: And we allow it.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah, we
have fascination

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
with that archetype,
the vampire.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's why all those
vampire movies are out there.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I think that's interesting.

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that always
speaks about where

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.820 align:middle line:84%
we're going through and
growing through as a culture.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I think we're kind
of ready to start

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
looking beyond a
narcissistic idea of destiny

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
into one that's really
about connection.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
that's for, you know?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the vampire,
the vampire is

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.119 align:middle line:84%
part of a wounded
energy in us that

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:90%
can't see itself in the mirror.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It can't see its light.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It needs to take life force
from other people to feel alive.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:90%
To sustain its life.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like a black hole in space.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It can suck light out of space.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, people can be like that.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.041 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a
narcissist complex.

00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But I think the journey of
destiny and one levelness field

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is also how do we
illumine and create

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:90%
a nuclear fusion from within?

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.697 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I don't need
you to necessarily tell me

00:19:26.697 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
how awesome I am, I'm just
going to give you light

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.738 align:middle line:90%
because it's my nature.

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
power of prayer.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Precious, because we're
used to those texts that

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:90%
were already written.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.474 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I feel it's
quite spontaneous thing.

00:19:39.474 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah, I think and
I have to say in my life,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.076 align:middle line:10%
I've had moments where
I've said soul prayers.

00:19:45.076 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a recent one.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
We had a massive
flood here in Boulder.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I luckily live a little
bit in the foothills,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:90%
so I felt pretty safe.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But everyone was taking
a hit by the time

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.121 align:middle line:90%
it was all said and done.

00:19:55.121 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Because it just was that bad.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.336 align:middle line:84%
And I had a moment
where I had to go out

00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and I had to start clearing
the gutters of my house

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:84%
off because water was starting
to seep down some of my walls

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.793 align:middle line:84%
and it was going to
cause some damage.

00:20:04.793 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So I get out there and
I go out my back garage

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of those doors
that locks on its own.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then once I'm
locked, I'm locked out.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I swear to you, I
walked out the back

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.006 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as that door shut,
I knew I'd been locked out.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
really, seriously?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Life?

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
God?

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:10%
Angels?

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:10%
And I said a prayer to my
father who has passed on.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I need you
to open my front door.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: That practical!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.739 align:middle line:90%
My god.

00:20:28.739 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: But that
came from here.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's happened
before where I've

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:84%
had those moments where
something, it came from this.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Right.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And I
just said, I need

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.924 align:middle line:84%
to walk and open
that front door.

00:20:38.924 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I cannot be out
here in the rain.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to break a window.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I walked around and that
front door was open.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was locked before
I left that house.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.064 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I felt
sick in my stomach

00:20:50.064 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
because I kept thinking
what if it's not open.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.938 align:middle line:90%
But I knew it would be.

00:20:52.938 --> 00:20:54.471 align:middle line:90%
I could feel the soul prayer.

00:20:54.471 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:90%
I call it a soul prayer.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Because we say ego prayers.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:10%
Wounded ego prayers.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:10%
And it's make this
person stay and love me.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:10%
Don't let them leave me.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:10%
You know, and we
all have said them.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:10%
And I'll probably say one later.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:07.716 align:middle line:90%
So you know it's--

00:21:07.716 --> 00:21:09.367 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Instead of, you know
what, if it's meant to be,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
let us find a common
new connection

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:90%
in this relationship.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.036 align:middle line:90%
That's a soul prayer.

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's I give
up the need for things

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to be a certain way and I
move into guidance and the way

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:90%
that they are meant to be.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So those are little destiny
bits that are there already.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah,
prayer is powerful.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's like
it's coming out,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
but it's already
there as you say.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.171 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: You can summon.

00:21:33.171 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I really believe you can summon
higher and greater forces

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.185 align:middle line:84%
through an engaging
and invocation of them.

00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I know that's true for me.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.475 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Do we have
to do meditation

00:21:41.475 --> 00:21:42.350 align:middle line:90%
to get to that state?

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:43.336 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I think you just
have to come from here.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:44.377 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Do you meditate?

00:21:44.377 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: I do meditate.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I try to
meditate every day.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:90%
I do yoga.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.567 align:middle line:10%
I think--

00:21:51.567 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You watch Gaiam videos?

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah, hello.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:10%
So I have my own practice
that kind of keeps me

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:10%
kind of in the zone
for my own self.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.203 align:middle line:10%
But I think, you
know, really there

00:22:02.203 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:10%
is no substitute for just
getting out in the world,

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.254 align:middle line:10%
and connecting, and
risking connection,

00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:10%
and living, and getting messy.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
That's where destiny's
going to happen.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen to us-- I always,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
when I used to teach yoga,
because I used to teach yoga

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.797 align:middle line:84%
back in the day, and I
used to tell the students--

00:22:14.797 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How many lives
did you have in one?

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I was a DJ, flight
attendant, taught yoga.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.665 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.665 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:10%
I used to tell
the yoga students,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:10%
you know, the real yoga happens
once you leave this classroom.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:10%
This is preparation for that.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:10%
Don't confuse this.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.780 align:middle line:10%
So that, to me, is
how I try to live.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Like those meditative
practices are

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.649 align:middle line:84%
to locate myself so I
can then take me to life.

00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And say,
hi, Lilou, hi, Gaiam.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.675 align:middle line:84%
You know, and kind
of engage people.

00:22:44.675 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Beautiful, Robert.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for this part two.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.055 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: That's authenticity.

00:22:48.055 --> 00:22:49.305 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, taking yourself to life.

00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
this beautiful interview.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Another great interview
with you, Robert.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.227 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: It was my pleasure.

00:22:57.227 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I look forward
to meeting you maybe

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:10%
next time en France.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Oui.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.142 align:middle line:90%
