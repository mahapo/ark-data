>> Lilou: Hello, my delicious
co-creators Lilou here.

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:17.051 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road this time near
Santa Barbara with you, Gary.

00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.018 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.255 align:middle line:90%
And we have our friend here.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.291 align:middle line:84%
>> Gary Douglas: [foreign name]
his real name was [foreign

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.793 align:middle line:90%
name], which means undesirable.

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:27.261 align:middle line:84%
And it's like that
doesn't fit him

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
because he is the most
desirable horse I've ever had

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.664 align:middle line:90%
in my entire life.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.266 align:middle line:84%
I've been riding
since I was two.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:37.004 align:middle line:84%
I'm 70. And so it's like
this horse does everything

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:84%
that I ever wanted
in a horse he has.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.042 align:middle line:84%
Besides the fact
that he's pretty.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: He is so
beautiful a real Pegasus.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to do this
interview with you, Gary,

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:84%
because you're known
for being the founder

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.416 align:middle line:90%
of Access Consciousness.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.385 align:middle line:84%
You're also a bestselling
author.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.221 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled to have
these open possibilities --

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
infinite possibilities
conversation, right?

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Gary Douglas:
Cool absolutely.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So tell us how can
we live from that living,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.832 align:middle line:90%
this infinite beautiful life.

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Gary Douglas: Well, the first
step as far as I'm concerned is

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:10.471 align:middle line:84%
to realize that your life is
supposed to be a celebration.

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.173 align:middle line:84%
And if you aren't
celebrating your life,

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:13.741 align:middle line:90%
why the heck are you alive?

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:16.277 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
you're just wasting air

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:17.478 align:middle line:90%
that other people could use.

00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like life
should be a celebration.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.447 align:middle line:90%
It should be a joy.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.248 align:middle line:84%
I have this friend
who lived with us

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.951 align:middle line:90%
for a while her name was Mary.

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.553 align:middle line:90%
And she was 96 years old.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:27.988 align:middle line:90%
She died when she was 97 or 98.

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:30.824 align:middle line:84%
I forget. And she
was living with us.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.495 align:middle line:84%
And she asked for Christmas
she wanted a pair of 600 count,

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:35.962 align:middle line:90%
you know, sateen sheets.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.397 align:middle line:90%
And I went, okay.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.365 align:middle line:90%
So I got them for her.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.934 align:middle line:84%
And she's, oh, these
are so lovely.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.702 align:middle line:84%
I'll keep them for
a special occasion.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Mary, if you wake

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning it's
a special occasion.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen
anybody sneaking

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:90%
into your room at night.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.543 align:middle line:84%
So let's just use
the darn things,

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:50.878 align:middle line:84%
will you because
this is ridiculous.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:52.947 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, your life
should be a celebration.

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:56.083 align:middle line:84%
Why do you save your
best stuff until later?

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.321 align:middle line:84%
Why do you save -- have your
best china and your, you know,

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.756 align:middle line:84%
your best silver,
and your best stuff

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:04.291 align:middle line:90%
that you don't use every day.

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:90%
I use my best china every day.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:07.928 align:middle line:90%
I use my best silver every day.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:10.097 align:middle line:90%
I use my best crystal every day.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.066 align:middle line:90%
I use everything every day.

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.667 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, I
could be dead tomorrow.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like today needs to
be the best day of my life.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.107 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't, why
the heck am I alive?

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:22.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You love horses
obviously, and here we're

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:26.113 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful ranch
with very special horses.

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:28.115 align:middle line:84%
Though you had an
accident with a horse,

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:84%
and you had all those
challenges.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.851 align:middle line:90%
And this is part of --

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.586 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Yeah, but it's like,
you know, you have an accident

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:84%
with a horse is like,
okay, fine.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.489 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.291 align:middle line:84%
It's like, okay, that's
part of what we do.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.593 align:middle line:84%
It's, you know, it's like
for most of us it's how most

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.262 align:middle line:84%
of us learn is with
the accidents.

00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:45.266 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like -- and
it's like for me I realized

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:46.699 align:middle line:90%
like this finger, okay?

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:51.472 align:middle line:84%
I broke it because I was riding
a horse that went up to a fence.

00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:55.209 align:middle line:84%
It was a brick wall,
and he stopped.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.345 align:middle line:84%
And then he decided to
jump it after he stopped.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.882 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't willing to
be aware enough to realize

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:03.484 align:middle line:90%
that he was going to do that.

00:03:03.484 --> 00:03:06.687 align:middle line:84%
And when I got aware enough
is when I realized, hey,

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:84%
there's a different
possibility here.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.491 align:middle line:84%
And I started riding
from awareness.

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:12.426 align:middle line:84%
And using awareness
as the source

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:14.328 align:middle line:90%
of what I rode and how I rode.

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:16.764 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, a whole
different universe opened up.

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:20.234 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when you ride from
awareness when you do your life

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:21.969 align:middle line:84%
from awareness, everything
gets better.

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.103 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So what is awareness?

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:24.471 align:middle line:90%
How do you define awareness?

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.707 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well awareness is
the knowing that you know.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:29.643 align:middle line:84%
And it's like one of the
things that always cracks me

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:33.247 align:middle line:84%
up is people will go, you know,
it's like I knew I shouldn't go

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:35.282 align:middle line:84%
out with this person, but I
went out with them anyway.

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:39.687 align:middle line:84%
I said so why did
you go out with them?

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:41.855 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I thought it
would turn out this way.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:90%
Or I thought it would do this.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.458 align:middle line:90%
Or I thought it would do this.

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's like the reality
was they knew it wasn't going

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.995 align:middle line:90%
to work.

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:50.097 align:middle line:84%
But instead of going, okay,
it's not going to work.

00:03:50.097 --> 00:03:53.334 align:middle line:84%
They went how do I make
this work, you know?

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like -- okay,
no, you can't eat her hair.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.805 align:middle line:90%
.

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:58.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it [inaudible].

00:03:58.472 --> 00:03:59.773 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D. He can't no.

00:03:59.773 --> 00:04:01.175 align:middle line:90%
It's okay.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.345 align:middle line:84%
But it's like literally, it's
like when you are with somebody

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:06.313 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
you're not --

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:09.283 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't be doing
this stop yourself.

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:12.419 align:middle line:84%
But I think most people if
they go back to their lives,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.787 align:middle line:84%
they'll be able to
see those places

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:15.255 align:middle line:84%
where they knew they
shouldn't do something.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:16.223 align:middle line:90%
And they did it anyway.

00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:17.423 align:middle line:90%
And it's like and it turned

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
out exactly the way they
knew it would turn out.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.862 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's because you know.

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:24.365 align:middle line:84%
But it's like everybody
acts like I don't know.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:27.167 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hear more
people say I don't know

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.304 align:middle line:84%
than any other phrase
I hear ever.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, I
go that's a lie.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.041 align:middle line:90%
You do know.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.277 align:middle line:84%
So what do you know
you don't want to know?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.979 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing
to me because it's

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.748 align:middle line:90%
like people go, I don't know.

00:04:40.748 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I go, you're infinite being,
how could you not know?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.184 align:middle line:90%
[sound effects].

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:48.222 align:middle line:84%
They don't have an
answer for that.

00:04:48.222 --> 00:04:50.457 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're talking about
intuition then or instinct.

00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.392 align:middle line:90%
What are we

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:52.326 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: It's more
than intuition.

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:53.394 align:middle line:90%
It's more than instinct.

00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.963 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is where
you know something --

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.164 align:middle line:84%
you know something's
not going to work

00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.065 align:middle line:84%
or something's wrong
or something's bad.

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:02.169 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know how or why.

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
But I'm talking about that place

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.606 align:middle line:84%
where you know you shouldn't do
something, and you do it anyway.

00:05:05.606 --> 00:05:07.007 align:middle line:84%
Thinking, well, I'll
get away with it.

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:08.175 align:middle line:90%
Or it'll work out.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:11.578 align:middle line:84%
Or it can't be that
bad or whatever.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You come to all these
conclusions instead

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.681 align:middle line:90%
the question.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.683 align:middle line:84%
And it's like if people started
to function from the question,

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.285 align:middle line:90%
life would get easier.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:20.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: In life there's so
many possibilities that come

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:22.923 align:middle line:90%
to us so many choices to make.

00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:25.459 align:middle line:90%
And we go certain paths.

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:27.161 align:middle line:90%
So how do we choose really?

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:29.096 align:middle line:84%
How do we shift to the
best possibilities?

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.732 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: The best way to do it
is every time you have a choice

00:05:31.732 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:90%
to make you go, okay,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
if I choose this what will my
life be like in five years?

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.606 align:middle line:84%
If I don't choose it, what will
my life be like in five years?

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:41.141 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to
function from that,

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:44.912 align:middle line:84%
you start to notice a certain
kind of energy that comes

00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.014 align:middle line:90%
up which is more expansive.

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.749 align:middle line:90%
You can see the possibilities.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.317 align:middle line:90%
You can feel the possibilities

00:05:50.317 --> 00:05:51.618 align:middle line:84%
when you ask what
will my life be

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.587 align:middle line:84%
like in five years
if I choose this.

00:05:53.587 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And you start to function
from that awareness.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.625 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the world
just gives you one gift

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.727 align:middle line:90%
after the other.

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:02.296 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thanks.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.165 align:middle line:90%
See, he agrees.

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:09.736 align:middle line:84%
So it's like it's really
that wondrous possibility

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:10.838 align:middle line:90%
that we could live from.

00:06:10.838 --> 00:06:12.873 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like from
our perspective it's

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.441 align:middle line:90%
like you have a choice in life.

00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.876 align:middle line:90%
You can ask a question.

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:19.079 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of a question is
to gain awareness not an answer.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:22.449 align:middle line:84%
And if you start doing
question from possibilities

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.087 align:middle line:84%
and from the awareness
you can get, then you end

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:28.856 align:middle line:90%
up with multiple choices.

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:30.924 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask on each
choice what will my life be

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
like if I choose this in five
years, and it's like you start

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.729 align:middle line:90%
to create more possibilities.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you notice
that the choices you make

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:42.102 align:middle line:84%
like interweave with different
possibilities to create this,

00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:45.038 align:middle line:84%
you know, the lineage
of your life.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.406 align:middle line:90%
The way it's going to work.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.809 align:middle line:84%
The way you're going to get
the things you really want.

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:51.378 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, the reality
is when you ask a question

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:54.481 align:middle line:84%
and you make a choice and
you create a possibility,

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:55.616 align:middle line:90%
the quantum entanglements

00:06:55.616 --> 00:06:57.784 align:middle line:84%
of the entire universe
do everything they can

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:58.986 align:middle line:90%
to contribute to you.

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.021 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love that word
quantum entanglements.

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:02.289 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Quantum
entanglement is how --

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.457 align:middle line:90%
it's the strength theory

00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:05.325 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
interconnected, which it is.

00:07:05.325 --> 00:07:07.628 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you ask,
and you shall receive.

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:09.162 align:middle line:90%
It's like you, you know, you ask

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:11.932 align:middle line:84%
for something you ever
notice how often you get it?

00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:14.268 align:middle line:84%
And yet you go how
did that happen?

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:18.705 align:middle line:84%
Because you were stupid enough
to ask [brief laughter].

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:19.840 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.408 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You've created --

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:25.279 align:middle line:84%
you founded 25 years
ago Access Conscious.

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well, first I
started out I was channeling.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.452 align:middle line:84%
And I was, you know, I
thought that was my calling.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You were
in real estate.

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.355 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: I was in real
estate before I'd started

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:90%
the channeling.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:84%
Then I started channeling,
and I thought, oh,

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:41.028 align:middle line:84%
that'll be perfect then I can
just close my eyes and say stuff

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.596 align:middle line:90%
and people will pay me money.

00:07:42.596 --> 00:07:44.865 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got so bored with it.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:46.333 align:middle line:90%
People would come and say, okay,

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:49.736 align:middle line:84%
so will my next half
have [inaudible].

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:50.938 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Will my boy -- my next
boyfriend have blue eyes?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.708 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:55.709 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you freaking go out

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.811 align:middle line:84%
and create your life,
you stupid cow?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.414 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like -- and
I said you know what?

00:08:00.414 --> 00:08:02.916 align:middle line:84%
If I can't get somebody in here
who wants something greater

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.419 align:middle line:84%
than a new boyfriend or
a new house, I don't want

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
to do this ever again.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.056 align:middle line:84%
And for six months I had
no channelings [phonetic].

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:10.591 align:middle line:84%
And then I had somebody
who came,

00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:12.659 align:middle line:84%
and they started
asking questions.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.462 align:middle line:84%
And that was when the stuff
about access began to show up.

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.297 align:middle line:84%
And it's like --
but they were asking

00:08:17.297 --> 00:08:18.632 align:middle line:90%
about how to get more aware.

00:08:18.632 --> 00:08:20.467 align:middle line:90%
How to get more consciousness.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:84%
How to create more
possibilities in life.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.504 align:middle line:84%
How to create something
that would be greater

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.073 align:middle line:90%
than what they currently have.

00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:28.709 align:middle line:84%
And that was the kind of people
that I wanted to deal with.

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:32.546 align:middle line:84%
And so I did the first
few classes, you know,

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:34.982 align:middle line:84%
with my eyes shut
and channeling it.

00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:36.383 align:middle line:90%
And then all of a sudden --

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How [inaudible]
technology showed up.

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: It showed up, yeah.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.787 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden
one day they went away,

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.523 align:middle line:84%
and they said you're on your
own get to work [yelling].

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.828 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it
was like [yelling].

00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, but the good news
is that the worst person

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.265 align:middle line:84%
who ever came to access who
couldn't tell the difference

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:55.068 align:middle line:84%
between body heat
and energy was me.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.771 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't tell the difference
between body heat and energy.

00:08:57.771 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was like everybody
else would, you know,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.508 align:middle line:84%
do this I see the
blah, blah blah.

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And this is -- and I go, okay.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But what it did is it
required me to ask a question.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.982 align:middle line:90%
Okay, how does this feel to you?

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:10.017 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be doing the bars.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say how does
this feel to you?

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.253 align:middle line:84%
And they go if you pull
any harder, you're going

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:14.421 align:middle line:90%
to suck me right out of my body.

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:15.288 align:middle line:90%
Okay, cool.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.256 align:middle line:90%
And I go down the feet.

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'd stand there
and, you know,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.625 align:middle line:90%
have no clue what was happening.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:19.926 align:middle line:84%
And I go, okay, how
does this feel to you?

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.029 align:middle line:84%
And they'd go if you pull
any harder, you're going

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:23.163 align:middle line:90%
to pull me out of my body.

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:24.965 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And then I'd go
to the next position.

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:26.199 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I started.

00:09:26.199 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Because it's like literally

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
for the first three
months I did this stuff.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.739 align:middle line:84%
I literally could
not feel anything.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.841 align:middle line:84%
I had no awareness
of what was going on.

00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:38.445 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know
what [sound effect].

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:90%
How come I can't do this?

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.148 align:middle line:90%
You know, and it's like --

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:43.817 align:middle line:84%
and I had the most
amazing experiences.

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:46.453 align:middle line:84%
And slowly but surely
I begin to trust

00:09:46.453 --> 00:09:47.421 align:middle line:90%
that I was doing something.

00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:48.722 align:middle line:84%
There was one lady
who came to me,

00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:51.291 align:middle line:90%
and she did a session with me.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.427 align:middle line:84%
And it's like about
the fourth session.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:56.163 align:middle line:84%
I thought nothing has
happened with this woman.

00:09:56.163 --> 00:09:57.631 align:middle line:90%
I'm just stealing her money.

00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.465 align:middle line:90%
I'm a charlatan.

00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm a terrible person.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.501 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this.

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:04.705 align:middle line:84%
So that day she came
in and I said, okay,

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.473 align:middle line:90%
so what do you want to do today?

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:07.674 align:middle line:84%
She said well, the
first thing I want

00:10:07.674 --> 00:10:08.875 align:middle line:90%
to do is tell you something.

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:10.544 align:middle line:90%
And I said, okay, what's that?

00:10:10.544 --> 00:10:14.314 align:middle line:84%
The first time I came to
you I've had terrible pain

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:84%
in my feet for the
last 15 years.

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.919 align:middle line:84%
And it's like --
and I'm a therapist.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:22.823 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit down and I, you
know, I roll around on my stool.

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.991 align:middle line:84%
And then when I get
up, I can barely walk

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.061 align:middle line:84%
for the first five
minutes it hurts so bad.

00:10:28.061 --> 00:10:30.397 align:middle line:84%
After the first session,
the pain all went away.

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:32.398 align:middle line:90%
I said it did?

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:33.934 align:middle line:90%
She said, yeah.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.502 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell you earlier

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.437 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
it might come back.

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.473 align:middle line:84%
But after the third session
and it hasn't come back.

00:10:39.473 --> 00:10:40.807 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
ever going to come back.

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.909 align:middle line:90%
And I went, all right.

00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.679 align:middle line:84%
But it's like those are the
kind of validations I got

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.747 align:middle line:90%
from what I was doing.

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:48.381 align:middle line:84%
People wouldn't tell
me up front.

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:49.683 align:middle line:90%
They'd wait for it to come back.

00:10:49.683 --> 00:10:51.585 align:middle line:84%
They'd try to find out if
it was going to come back.

00:10:51.585 --> 00:10:54.955 align:middle line:84%
They'd try to find out if
the pain still existed.

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.357 align:middle line:84%
And it's like -- and
that's when I learned

00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:58.892 align:middle line:84%
that most people are
not willing to give

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:00.794 align:middle line:90%
up their pain and suffering.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.632 align:middle line:84%
Why would pain and
suffering be more real to us

00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:10.337 align:middle line:84%
and more valuable to us than the
joy of our bodies and our lives

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:14.541 align:middle line:84%
and our, you know, our
infinite being and our choices?

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:18.812 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to ride a
horse like this, you know?

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.414 align:middle line:90%
These things are great.

00:11:21.414 --> 00:11:24.184 align:middle line:84%
And this is -- we
all have this place

00:11:24.184 --> 00:11:25.552 align:middle line:84%
where life should
be a celebration,

00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:90%
and we're not celebrating.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.022 align:middle line:84%
We're acting like
it's a bad party.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.257 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:33.827 align:middle line:84%
So how did you define Access
Consciousness, though?

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:35.028 align:middle line:90%
Because I hear energy.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.396 align:middle line:90%
I hear --

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:38.432 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Okay, so access is a
set of tools and techniques.

00:11:38.432 --> 00:11:40.133 align:middle line:84%
It's the weirdest,
wildest, wackiest,

00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:42.536 align:middle line:84%
thing you'll ever
do, and it works.

00:11:42.536 --> 00:11:43.336 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:11:43.336 --> 00:11:44.738 align:middle line:90%
That's my explanation of it.

00:11:44.738 --> 00:11:47.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because there's also
questions and practical aspect

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:51.111 align:middle line:84%
to hear you speak of body and of
energies so how is that related?

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:54.114 align:middle line:84%
How do you see first of all
human beings on this planet?

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:54.981 align:middle line:90%
What are we here for?

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:56.817 align:middle line:90%
What is the nature of reality?

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:57.651 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: Okay.

00:11:57.651 --> 00:11:58.785 align:middle line:90%
So first of all, I'd like to say

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that people say what's
the purpose of my life?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.354 align:middle line:90%
And I go to have fun.

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:03.023 align:middle line:90%
And they go what?

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:05.392 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, the purpose
of your life is to have fun?

00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean the birds don't
get up in the morning

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.763 align:middle line:84%
and go I'm having
a bad feather day.

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:12.699 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
sing for you all.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:14.901 align:middle line:84%
They get up in the morning and
go tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet,

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.236 align:middle line:90%
and they have a good time.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.905 align:middle line:84%
The horses get up and they
go, wow, what can we do today?

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:19.439 align:middle line:90%
Let's run.

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's kick.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:90%
Let's play, you know?

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The cows go, oh, we'll chew our
cuds until somebody comes along

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.212 align:middle line:90%
and has us for hamburger.

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:27.247 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like they
don't have this point of view

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:29.282 align:middle line:90%
that there's a bad anything.

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:32.319 align:middle line:84%
The judgment of bad is
something we do to ourselves,

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.621 align:middle line:90%
and it's such a wrongness.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:37.757 align:middle line:84%
You know we make ourselves
wrong for all the wrong things.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.359 align:middle line:90%
What we should do is be happy.

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:41.294 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
and if the joy

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:45.799 align:middle line:84%
of your life is your target
then your life expands.

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:49.069 align:middle line:84%
If getting rid of your
misery is your target,

00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:50.637 align:middle line:90%
you get more misery.

00:12:50.637 --> 00:12:53.974 align:middle line:84%
Because what you focus
on is what you get.

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:55.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how
do you define this?

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:57.911 align:middle line:84%
How do you [horse
sounds] I hear you.

00:12:57.911 --> 00:12:59.312 align:middle line:90%
[horse sounds].

00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:06.519 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, settle down.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.855 align:middle line:90%
Stop it. Listen to me.

00:13:08.855 --> 00:13:09.422 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:10.056 align:middle line:90%
Come here.

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:11.424 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet. Be calm.

00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:13.994 align:middle line:84%
Come on you're not going
to get a mare right now.

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:15.395 align:middle line:90%
It's breeding season.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:18.231 align:middle line:84%
So he thinks he should
be out there doing it.

00:13:18.231 --> 00:13:19.299 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, he
wants to have fun too.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:20.133 align:middle line:90%
He wants to play.

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:20.767 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: He wants to have fun.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:21.568 align:middle line:90%
He wants to play.

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:22.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That's his thing.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Gary Douglas:
Yeah, that's his --

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.204 align:middle line:90%
he wants to play with his thing.

00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Right. [brief laughter] yeah.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.377 align:middle line:84%
It's like he has a point of view
that his job is to make babies.

00:13:30.377 --> 00:13:32.345 align:middle line:90%
I know. And it's like and --

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:34.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Good wrong just it is.

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:35.949 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: It's just
his job, yeah.

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:37.317 align:middle line:84%
And he has no point
of view about it.

00:13:37.317 --> 00:13:39.886 align:middle line:84%
It's like, okay, can
I make a baby now?

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:42.656 align:middle line:90%
Not, I don't get to make a baby?

00:13:42.656 --> 00:13:45.125 align:middle line:84%
Not, what's wrong with me that
I don't get to make a baby?

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:48.128 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, okay,
when can I make a baby?

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:90%
He's always in question.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.564 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
way to function.

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:54.901 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- and people don't
realize that just by functioning

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.671 align:middle line:84%
from that question, okay, so
what's really possible today?

00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.606 align:middle line:84%
What could I be or
do different today

00:13:59.606 --> 00:14:02.475 align:middle line:84%
that would change my
life totally right away?

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:05.345 align:middle line:84%
And that's the question I ask
people and ask all the time.

00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
What can I be or
do different today?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.714 align:middle line:90%
Not differently.

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:09.115 align:middle line:90%
Because differently is trying

00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:12.185 align:middle line:84%
to take something you're already
doing that isn't working well.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:84%
And tweaking it so
it works better.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:84%
No, it's like what can
you be or do different?

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.259 align:middle line:84%
It will create a
totally different realty.

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:22.329 align:middle line:84%
If you start to function from
what you can be or do different,

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:25.398 align:middle line:84%
you start to open the doors
to all the possibilities

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:27.734 align:middle line:84%
that exist throughout
the entire universe.

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:30.136 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
like unfortunately been

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:31.604 align:middle line:90%
in training to this realty.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:35.175 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this reality is
about, you know, work hard.

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:39.179 align:middle line:84%
Have 2.5 children, a white
picket fence, 2.4 cars,

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:40.981 align:middle line:84%
and a dog and live
in the suburbs.

00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:42.482 align:middle line:90%
And live happily ever after.

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:44.484 align:middle line:84%
Except how many people have
you met are actually happy

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:46.553 align:middle line:90%
with that?

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:50.056 align:middle line:84%
No. It's like they don't end
up being happy with that.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.727 align:middle line:84%
They end up feeling like
somehow their life is stifled.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:56.229 align:middle line:84%
It's like they know there's
got to be something greater.

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:58.498 align:middle line:84%
And I knew as a kid there
had to be something greater.

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:00.266 align:middle line:84%
When I was a little
kid they used to ask me

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.202 align:middle line:84%
so what do you want to
be when you grow up, son?

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
I go, I want to be happy.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.573 align:middle line:84%
And they go, no, son, what do
you want to be when you grow up?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:09.109 align:middle line:84%
Happy. No, son, do you
want to be a doctor,

00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:11.745 align:middle line:90%
a lawyer, or Indian chief?

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Any of those as long
as I'm happy.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.949 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's like -- and
it was always about happiness

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:17.617 align:middle line:90%
for me and the joy of it.

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Because somewhere
in my universe,

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.955 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that happiness
was the greatest gift

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.289 align:middle line:90%
that we have on planet earth.

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:25.091 align:middle line:90%
And the one thing we don't do.

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:26.459 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's interesting is

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:28.294 align:middle line:84%
like I keep trying to
tell people, you know,

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:32.365 align:middle line:84%
if you actually live in the
question, make your choices,

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:33.733 align:middle line:90%
have the possibility,

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:37.837 align:middle line:84%
and request of the quantum
entanglements to help you.

00:15:37.837 --> 00:15:40.373 align:middle line:84%
And you laugh a lot
you heal the planet.

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:42.742 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's trying to
save the freaking planet.

00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:44.511 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't want
to save the whales,

00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.345 align:middle line:90%
I want to go educate them.

00:15:45.345 --> 00:15:47.047 align:middle line:90%
When you hear this noise run.

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:51.284 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm sorry, were
out trying to save the whales.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:52.786 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we educating
the whales

00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.621 align:middle line:84%
on when you hear
these guys coming,

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
when you feel this
energy, get lost?

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.326 align:middle line:84%
You know, disappear
because they can do it.

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.062 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know
they can do it.

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:06.599 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have a point
of view about being harpooned.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.401 align:middle line:84%
Their point of view
is live in the sea.

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.169 align:middle line:90%
We have a good time.

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.738 align:middle line:90%
And when we stop, we stop.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Death doesn't mean
anything to them.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.342 align:middle line:84%
Death is a very meaningful
thing to us.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how do you remove
all of those layers and layers

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:21.614 align:middle line:84%
of beingness [phonetic]
of being a certain way

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:25.051 align:middle line:84%
or thinking a certain way
and this voice and this sound

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that just goes on and
on and on like a tape?

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:27.887 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: Yeah, it is a tape.

00:16:27.887 --> 00:16:29.355 align:middle line:90%
Is what it really is.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] heard some of
those people who talk to you,

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.359 align:middle line:84%
and it's like you know this
is tape number 255 heard

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.828 align:middle line:90%
that story 800 times.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:39.466 align:middle line:84%
Okay, it's tape number 452, and
we've heard that story 27 times.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like most people live their
lives from this tape library

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.072 align:middle line:84%
that they think equals
something.

00:16:46.072 --> 00:16:49.476 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that
I've developed in access,

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:53.179 align:middle line:84%
that we've developed in access,
is these tools and techniques

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.448 align:middle line:84%
that are ways to
unlock that place

00:16:55.448 --> 00:16:59.552 align:middle line:84%
where you've decided something
is so that actually isn't.

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:04.557 align:middle line:84%
Because like what we think is
so, isn't actually correct.

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:06.793 align:middle line:84%
And it's like what
we're taught here --

00:17:06.793 --> 00:17:09.529 align:middle line:84%
you know it's like you're
taught when you're a little kid.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.164 align:middle line:90%
Don't touch that thing.

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:15.902 align:middle line:84%
Then now that you're 18, you're
supposed to touch that thing.

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:17.102 align:middle line:90%
And it's like [sound effects].

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:20.139 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like you're
just -- you're confused.

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:22.908 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we are
taught so many things

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.145 align:middle line:84%
about what we're not
supposed to be or do or have

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:26.379 align:middle line:90%
or create or generate.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Ah, ah, don't you eat that.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.448 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat it.

00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:29.582 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat it.

00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:31.117 align:middle line:90%
No, don't do that.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:35.922 align:middle line:84%
Be good. You're not
allowed to eat it, okay?

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.424 align:middle line:90%
No don't eat.

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.093 align:middle line:90%
Okay, thank you.

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:41.728 align:middle line:90%
So -- gotcha [brief laughter].

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:50.803 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if we
started to look at --

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.341 align:middle line:84%
okay, so what's really
true for us?

00:17:55.341 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And most of us never
ask that question.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.549 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like -- and it's

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle line:84%
like in access we say
there's two kinds of people

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.252 align:middle line:84%
in the world the humans
and the humanoids.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:08.388 align:middle line:84%
The humans always make you
wrong for everything you do.

00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.456 align:middle line:84%
And tell you how you can't
do it, and you won't do it,

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:11.824 align:middle line:90%
and you shouldn't do it.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And the humanoids are
always the ones that go

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.296 align:middle line:84%
if we did this it would
be so much better.

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:17.564 align:middle line:84%
And it's like and
can't we do this?

00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:19.832 align:middle line:84%
And humanoids are always
the ones that take a job,

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.034 align:middle line:90%
and it's like within three days

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.635 align:middle line:84%
to three weeks they
know everything.

00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:25.238 align:middle line:84%
And they want to change
it to make it better.

00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:27.507 align:middle line:84%
Humans always go, no,
you can't do that.

00:18:27.507 --> 00:18:28.708 align:middle line:90%
We've always done it this way.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:29.976 align:middle line:90%
We'll always do it this way.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:31.444 align:middle line:90%
This is just the way it's done.

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:32.979 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.049 align:middle line:90%
And you go, but -- and they go,

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:40.119 align:middle line:84%
don't give me your buts just
do it the way I tell you.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.822 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they don't
want to change things.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they want
to change their underwear,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle line:84%
and that's about all
they want to change.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.162 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, they are
not going to change anything.

00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:52.165 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like with the
humanoids they've created all

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.733 align:middle line:84%
the great art, all
the great literature.

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.969 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like the
people who do the kind

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.203 align:middle line:90%
of stuff you're doing.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:58.171 align:middle line:90%
You got to be a humanoid.

00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.339 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't ask questions.

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:02.108 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a humanoid
and do something unique.

00:19:02.108 --> 00:19:05.278 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a humanoid and
create a different realty.

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:09.782 align:middle line:84%
If you're, you know, it's like
if you're human, you have no --

00:19:09.782 --> 00:19:11.784 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like you don't
want to change anything.

00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:14.254 align:middle line:84%
If you're a humanoid you
have to change everything.

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:15.922 align:middle line:84%
And you're always
looking for more.

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.657 align:middle line:84%
And it's like if you've
always had the point of view

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.627 align:middle line:84%
that there ought to be
more there should be more,

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:22.228 align:middle line:90%
than you're a humanoid.

00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:25.265 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's not a wrongness,
it's just a difference.

00:19:25.265 --> 00:19:27.367 align:middle line:84%
But you're the kind of person
that will go try things

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.868 align:middle line:90%
and go do something different.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:31.204 align:middle line:84%
And search the world
for a greater answer,

00:19:31.204 --> 00:19:32.839 align:middle line:90%
a greater possibility.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:37.677 align:middle line:84%
Where the humans will go,
well, that's a waste of time.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like -- I was
working on a lady that's

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:90%
in my family a few years ago.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle line:90%
And I worked on her.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, that was
a glorious waste of time.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.055 align:middle line:90%
Okay, cool.

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:51.791 align:middle line:84%
And it's like and she doesn't
ask me a question ever.

00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We talk on the phone
about once a month.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.296 align:middle line:84%
But she never asks me a
question about me, my life,

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:57.497 align:middle line:90%
my horses, or anything.

00:19:57.497 --> 00:20:00.333 align:middle line:84%
She tells me about her,
her friends who are dying

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.436 align:middle line:84%
and her horses and
her dogs and cats.

00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.305 align:middle line:90%
But never asks a thing about me.

00:20:05.305 --> 00:20:06.539 align:middle line:90%
She has no interest.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:09.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you deal
with the humans then?

00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:12.178 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: You just recognize that
with a human you got to ask them

00:20:12.178 --> 00:20:13.646 align:middle line:90%
to do certain things for you.

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:16.049 align:middle line:84%
Because humans are really
good at doing certain things.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:19.285 align:middle line:84%
They can do the same thing
over again a thousand times

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:21.321 align:middle line:90%
and not change anything with it.

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:26.059 align:middle line:84%
You, as a humanoid, always
have to change everything.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.995 align:middle line:84%
Ever notice, I mean,
you put on a dress.

00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:33.466 align:middle line:84%
You don't wear the same shoes,
the same hat, the same anything.

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.867 align:middle line:84%
You got to have something
different.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.136 align:middle line:84%
Okay, well, these earrings will
look really good with this.

00:20:37.136 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, I'll wear these
shoes that'll make it look

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:40.707 align:middle line:90%
so different.

00:20:40.707 --> 00:20:42.508 align:middle line:84%
You know because that's
the way you function

00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:43.643 align:middle line:90%
when you're a humanoid.

00:20:43.643 --> 00:20:45.511 align:middle line:84%
You're always wanting to
have something different

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:46.746 align:middle line:90%
and change something.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.548 align:middle line:84%
And you're never happy
with doing it the same way.

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:84%
But the humans, they'll wear
the same dress with the same,

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:53.586 align:middle line:90%
you know, the same outfits,

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.122 align:middle line:84%
the same clothes
over and over again.

00:20:56.122 --> 00:20:59.192 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing to
me to watch them do it

00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:01.794 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen
them again, and again.

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:05.064 align:middle line:84%
They come into the office, and
they've got on the same outfit

00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:08.067 align:middle line:84%
that they had two weeks ago
with exactly the same earrings,

00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:10.203 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same shoes,
exactly the same purse.

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:12.171 align:middle line:84%
And it's like everything's
exactly the same.

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:14.741 align:middle line:84%
But they don't see any reason
to do anything different.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:18.811 align:middle line:84%
For them, it's about
sameness is the best.

00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:21.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So humans can
transform into humanoids?

00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:23.616 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: No, they can't.

00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like --

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: No awakening possible?

00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:26.753 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: No.

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:27.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Ever?

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:28.855 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: Ever.

00:21:28.855 --> 00:21:30.256 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like you
wouldn't expect a monkey

00:21:30.256 --> 00:21:32.525 align:middle line:90%
to become a guerilla would you?

00:21:32.525 --> 00:21:35.361 align:middle line:84%
Why would you expect a
human to become a humanoid?

00:21:36.396 --> 00:21:37.663 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
they're, you know,

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.766 align:middle line:84%
it's like the monkey's
an infinite thing,

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.033 align:middle line:84%
the guerilla's an
infinite being.

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
But they ain't going to
take those other bodies.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:43.903 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, you know,

00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:47.273 align:middle line:84%
it's like in only humans
will actually choose to take

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:49.275 align:middle line:90%
on a different body form.

00:21:49.275 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like, you know,

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.348 align:middle line:84%
monkeys would never
bother to be a human.

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:56.449 align:middle line:90%
You guys are stupid.

00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:58.484 align:middle line:84%
You got to work and
all that stuff instead

00:21:58.484 --> 00:21:59.786 align:middle line:90%
of having some fool feed you.

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:05.925 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like they
don't work that hard.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:07.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So there's
no possibilities

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:11.798 align:middle line:84%
of transformation though you
bring abscess consciousness

00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:12.799 align:middle line:90%
so I'm sure --

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: There's
great possibilities --

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Would you say
that you only attract them

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
in Access Consciousness
[inaudible].

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: It used to be
only humanoids came.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.142 align:middle line:84%
Now humans are starting
to show up.

00:22:23.142 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
But the humanoids are
starting to value the fact

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:26.746 align:middle line:90%
that they're different.

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:29.415 align:middle line:84%
And that's the gift that
recognizing your difference

00:22:29.415 --> 00:22:32.318 align:middle line:90%
and not making it wrong is.

00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:34.587 align:middle line:84%
When you're willing to be
the difference you are,

00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:37.023 align:middle line:84%
it's like then you no
longer make yourself wrong

00:22:37.023 --> 00:22:38.257 align:middle line:90%
for being different.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:40.493 align:middle line:84%
You go, okay, I'm
just different.

00:22:40.493 --> 00:22:42.462 align:middle line:90%
Not wrong, just different.

00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is a whole lot

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.965 align:middle line:84%
of humans are showing
up to access now.

00:22:45.965 --> 00:22:48.634 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting results,
and they're changing too.

00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:50.036 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, will they
ever become humanoids?

00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:53.539 align:middle line:84%
I doubt it because they have
a tendency to sit in judgment.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:55.708 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
it's like the thing

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.276 align:middle line:84%
about humans is they
will always judge you

00:22:57.276 --> 00:23:00.213 align:middle line:84%
as if you just didn't do that
everything would be fine.

00:23:00.213 --> 00:23:03.382 align:middle line:84%
Humanoids are going, oh, my
god, I'm such a terrible person.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:04.784 align:middle line:90%
I'm so judgmental.

00:23:04.784 --> 00:23:06.385 align:middle line:90%
If you think you're judgmental,

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:10.156 align:middle line:84%
you are 99 percent
chance humanoid.

00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:13.259 align:middle line:84%
Humans never assume
that they're judgmental.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:17.296 align:middle line:90%
They always assume their right.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:21.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And so the purpose of
being a humanoid on the planet,

00:23:21.934 --> 00:23:23.336 align:middle line:90%
what does that come with?

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:25.705 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: It's like not so much
that there's a purpose to it,

00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:27.874 align:middle line:84%
it's a recognition
you need to have

00:23:27.874 --> 00:23:30.243 align:middle line:84%
that you don't function
like other people.

00:23:30.243 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:84%
Then you won't make
yourself wrong

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
for not functioning
the way they do.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.983 align:middle line:84%
You'll look at how what you
do can be a valuable product.

00:23:36.983 --> 00:23:40.152 align:middle line:84%
And how to create your life
from that valuable product.

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:43.022 align:middle line:84%
It's like one of the things that
access has done is allowed a lot

00:23:43.022 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
of the people who always thought
themselves wrong have learned

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.862 align:middle line:84%
that they're not wrong,
they're different.

00:23:49.862 --> 00:23:51.731 align:middle line:84%
And now they've learned
how to use that difference

00:23:51.731 --> 00:23:52.832 align:middle line:90%
to make a lot of money.

00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:54.233 align:middle line:90%
It's working.

00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:56.736 align:middle line:84%
You know because
most of us, you know,

00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:58.871 align:middle line:84%
it's like I was taught
you have to work hard.

00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:01.007 align:middle line:84%
You save your money, and
then some day you'll be able

00:24:01.007 --> 00:24:02.308 align:middle line:90%
to retire.

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:05.711 align:middle line:90%
And I went what?

00:24:05.711 --> 00:24:08.014 align:middle line:90%
First of all, I didn't

00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
like working hard
unless I was enjoying it.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.588 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, saving my
money seemed just pointless.

00:24:15.588 --> 00:24:19.625 align:middle line:84%
And third of all,
retire to do what?

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:23.529 align:middle line:84%
Sit in my driveway and judge
the neighbors like, you know,

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:27.099 align:middle line:84%
all my neighbors were
doing that were retired?

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:28.901 align:middle line:84%
They would sit in their
driveways in their garages

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:31.137 align:middle line:84%
and judge everybody
else who drove by.

00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:35.575 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, this is what you
want to do with your life

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:37.076 align:middle line:90%
at the end of your life?

00:24:37.076 --> 00:24:39.412 align:middle line:84%
So retirement is
valuable based on what?

00:24:39.412 --> 00:24:42.248 align:middle line:90%
I don't ever plan on retiring.

00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:46.352 align:middle line:84%
It's like when I retire, it'll
because I'm six feet under.

00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:49.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are
some of those questions

00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:51.924 align:middle line:84%
that deepen the experience
of life?

00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:53.059 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well, you
know, it's like one

00:24:53.059 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
of the questions I
always ask people.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.662 align:middle line:84%
Just ask how does it get
any better than this?

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:59.465 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lady who came to
one of my classes in New York,

00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:01.867 align:middle line:84%
and she walked outside the
door and she found a dime.

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.369 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, how does
it get any better than this?

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:05.438 align:middle line:84%
And she's walking down to
the subway in New York,

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:07.573 align:middle line:90%
and she found a $10 bill.

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:10.109 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, wow,
flag down a cab,

00:25:10.109 --> 00:25:12.178 align:middle line:84%
and said how's it get
any better than this?

00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.314 align:middle line:84%
She was driven to her
destination right in front

00:25:15.314 --> 00:25:16.449 align:middle line:90%
of her apartment building.

00:25:16.449 --> 00:25:17.883 align:middle line:84%
And as she opened
the door to get out,

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:19.952 align:middle line:84%
she saw something
sparkling down in the gutter.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:22.355 align:middle line:84%
And she picked it up, and
it was a diamond bracelet.

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:27.393 align:middle line:84%
She went from dimes to
diamonds with three questions.

00:25:27.393 --> 00:25:30.496 align:middle line:84%
And then she went, ah, can't
get any better than this,

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:31.897 align:middle line:90%
and that ended it all.

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:33.866 align:middle line:84%
If she kept asking does it
get any better than this,

00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:35.234 align:middle line:84%
she might have had
something even greater

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:36.402 align:middle line:90%
than just a diamond bracelet.

00:25:36.402 --> 00:25:38.504 align:middle line:90%
You never can tell.

00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does that
play in changing the world?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.843 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well, the thing is
that when you are in question

00:25:43.843 --> 00:25:47.546 align:middle line:84%
of things, you don't
come to the conclusions

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:49.215 align:middle line:84%
that make things
stop and not work.

00:25:49.215 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So a conclusion, a
judgment, a decision,

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.886 align:middle line:84%
a computation are always
things that are judgments

00:25:53.886 --> 00:25:56.522 align:middle line:84%
that stop the world,
detract the world.

00:25:56.522 --> 00:25:58.991 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when you ask a
question, you open the doors

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:90%
to other possibilities.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.598 align:middle line:84%
I went to the airport one time
and I asked for, you know,

00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I said I've got seats on
this plane at this time.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.103 align:middle line:84%
And the guy goes I don't
have you in here, sir.

00:26:11.103 --> 00:26:12.738 align:middle line:84%
I said but here,
here's the ticket.

00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:14.774 align:middle line:84%
So he looked at it
and goes, sir,

00:26:14.774 --> 00:26:16.575 align:middle line:84%
you're plane trip
is for tomorrow.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:17.777 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, Jesus.

00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:20.312 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than this?

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:26.085 align:middle line:84%
I said can you do anything
for me [horse sounds] stop,

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:28.387 align:middle line:90%
stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:29.455 align:middle line:90%
Can you do anything for me?

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:32.591 align:middle line:90%
[horse sounds] Stop.

00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:33.492 align:middle line:90%
It's a gelding.

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:34.927 align:middle line:90%
It's not a mare.

00:26:34.927 --> 00:26:37.363 align:middle line:90%
Just because she's yelling,

00:26:37.363 --> 00:26:39.465 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean she can
do anything for you.

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:42.034 align:middle line:84%
So it's -- anyway, so
it's like, you know,

00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:43.369 align:middle line:90%
it's like it was very funny.

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, ouch,
that was not nice.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.279 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, it's like I ask him
can you do anything for me?

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well,
let me see here.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.183 align:middle line:84%
You know it's going to cost
you $75 to change this ticket.

00:26:57.183 --> 00:26:58.484 align:middle line:90%
And I said, okay, that's fine.

00:26:58.484 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- that's less
expensive than the embarrassment

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
of calling my friend up and
going back to his house to stay

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.592 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
I had it all right.

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:08.928 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it's very
embarrassing to stay

00:27:08.928 --> 00:27:10.229 align:middle line:90%
at somebody's house and then

00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:12.164 align:middle line:84%
when you leave you
have to come back.

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:14.266 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's good.

00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:15.234 align:middle line:90%
So I said I'll pay it.

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:16.936 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, okay, fine.

00:27:16.936 --> 00:27:18.037 align:middle line:90%
And then he goes [sound effect].

00:27:18.037 --> 00:27:20.372 align:middle line:84%
And he goes you know
what, here it's on me.

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:21.774 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:27:21.774 --> 00:27:24.043 align:middle line:84%
And I got on the plane, and it
didn't cost me anything extra.

00:27:24.043 --> 00:27:25.644 align:middle line:84%
And just from asking the
question how does it get any

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:26.579 align:middle line:90%
better than this.

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And a lady who went to Paris,

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.449 align:middle line:84%
and she had no hotel
reservations.

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:35.221 align:middle line:84%
And she walked in, and she says
can I get a room for the night?

00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:39.058 align:middle line:84%
And the receptionist says,
oh, we are fully booked, lady.

00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:42.128 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, how does
it get any better than that?

00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And the woman looked
at her confused.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.866 align:middle line:90%
And she goes one moment.

00:27:46.866 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And she goes in the back room
and the manager comes out

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.606 align:middle line:84%
and says, madam, we
are fully booked.

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:55.374 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, how does
it get any better than that?

00:27:55.374 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do have
the penthouse suite,

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
which is normally this amount.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.512 align:middle line:90%
But we'll give it to you

00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:01.447 align:middle line:84%
at our regular rate
since nobody's there.

00:28:01.447 --> 00:28:02.648 align:middle line:84%
How long -- you know,
it's like as long

00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:04.683 align:middle line:84%
as you don't stay
more than two days.

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.185 align:middle line:90%
And she goes no problem.

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:10.656 align:middle line:84%
And so she got a penthouse
suite for the same price

00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:12.892 align:middle line:84%
as a regular room in a
hotel that was fully booked.

00:28:12.892 --> 00:28:15.327 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than that?

00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:18.297 align:middle line:84%
But those kind of questions, if
you ask those kind of questions,

00:28:18.297 --> 00:28:20.966 align:middle line:90%
the universe takes care of you.

00:28:20.966 --> 00:28:23.803 align:middle line:84%
It looks at, okay, so
what might be possible.

00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:25.204 align:middle line:90%
And will rearrange things

00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:28.307 align:middle line:84%
so you get a better choice,
a better possibility.

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:31.677 align:middle line:90%
And it's bizarre, but it works.

00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:33.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And for
changing the world?

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:36.315 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: For changing
the world, laugh.

00:28:36.315 --> 00:28:39.118 align:middle line:84%
The more laughter, the more
joy you bring into the world,

00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:42.354 align:middle line:84%
the more you change the world
to a better place to live.

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like happiness is
the greatest gift you can give

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.425 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's like if people will
function from the happiness

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.564 align:middle line:84%
and the joy they have and the
possibilities that get created

00:28:51.564 --> 00:28:54.200 align:middle line:84%
from that, everything
begins to work.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.535 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
I never get bummed.

00:28:56.535 --> 00:28:58.103 align:middle line:84%
Well, I do get bummed
occasionally, you know,

00:28:58.103 --> 00:28:59.205 align:middle line:90%
but it's usually about --

00:28:59.205 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:84%
like I have about a ten
minute bad hair day.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.042 align:middle line:90%
You know, and that's about it.

00:29:03.042 --> 00:29:06.345 align:middle line:84%
And it's like there was a point
at which I was like, oh, my god,

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:07.379 align:middle line:90%
what's wrong with my money?

00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:08.714 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
money in the bank.

00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:10.082 align:middle line:90%
And I go something's wrong.

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.251 align:middle line:90%
And I went -- nice yawn.

00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:15.421 align:middle line:84%
I went, okay, so who do I need
to call to find out about this?

00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:17.056 align:middle line:90%
And I thought of three people.

00:29:17.056 --> 00:29:18.791 align:middle line:90%
And I called those three people.

00:29:18.791 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:90%
No. I called the three people.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.829 align:middle line:90%
And within 20 minutes I found

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:27.533 align:middle line:84%
out that this credit card
company had been keeping $61,000

00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:28.934 align:middle line:90%
of my money without telling me.

00:29:28.934 --> 00:29:32.538 align:middle line:84%
And I went -- I knew
something was not right.

00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:33.873 align:middle line:84%
But it's like literally
it's [inaudible].

00:29:33.873 --> 00:29:36.575 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when you start
to function from that level

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:39.278 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and when you know
something's funky you start

00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:42.615 align:middle line:84%
asking questions, instead
of going I feel like crap.

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:45.117 align:middle line:84%
If you go I feel like crap,
guess what you get to do?

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:46.218 align:middle line:90%
Feel like crap.

00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:47.453 align:middle line:90%
But if you're not feeling --

00:29:47.453 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:84%
if things are not
feeling quite right, okay,

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:50.489 align:middle line:90%
what is it I need here?

00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:52.524 align:middle line:84%
And it's like one of the
things I teach people is

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:53.893 align:middle line:90%
that if you're confused,

00:29:53.893 --> 00:29:56.996 align:middle line:84%
always ask what information do
I need that I'm not getting.

00:29:56.996 --> 00:29:58.831 align:middle line:84%
Because literally, the only
time you're confused is

00:29:58.831 --> 00:30:00.566 align:middle line:90%
when you lack information.

00:30:00.566 --> 00:30:02.801 align:middle line:90%
Don't bite me either.

00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:05.971 align:middle line:90%
Not me, not the bench.

00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:08.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Money conversation
a big one for a lot of us.

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
How do you view money
or how do you --

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
because there's a big
conversation around the crisis

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.183 align:middle line:84%
or on the financial -- like
how can I do really my dreams

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
if I can't handle
the regular stuff?

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.188 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well, the thing is it's
like you got to realize, okay,

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:25.157 align:middle line:84%
so what would it take for
-- what would I have to be

00:30:25.157 --> 00:30:27.259 align:middle line:84%
or do different today that would
create more money right away?

00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:28.761 align:middle line:90%
And use that question.

00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:31.597 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how
much it changes things.

00:30:31.597 --> 00:30:35.901 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the one thing I
realized is money's the gasoline

00:30:35.901 --> 00:30:37.336 align:middle line:90%
that makes your car go.

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:39.471 align:middle line:90%
It's not your life.

00:30:39.471 --> 00:30:41.707 align:middle line:90%
And it's not the be all end all.

00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:47.413 align:middle line:84%
And I met lots of people who
have serious amounts of money,

00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:48.814 align:middle line:90%
but they're not happy.

00:30:48.814 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I've met a few
people that are happy,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.652 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have a lot
of money, but they're happy.

00:30:53.652 --> 00:30:55.287 align:middle line:84%
I go, okay, so what's
the difference?

00:30:55.287 --> 00:30:57.489 align:middle line:84%
And they always manage
to pay all their bills,

00:30:57.489 --> 00:30:59.625 align:middle line:90%
even those still due bills.

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:02.828 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that if you --
you know, it's like if you --

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:05.998 align:middle line:84%
the other thing you want to do
is make sure you pay you first.

00:31:05.998 --> 00:31:08.033 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I noticed
is people have a tendency

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:10.269 align:middle line:84%
to pay their bills
first and them last.

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:12.738 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I
tell people put 10 percent

00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:15.908 align:middle line:84%
of every dollar that comes
into your life put it away.

00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:17.776 align:middle line:90%
Put it away and never spend it.

00:31:17.776 --> 00:31:20.713 align:middle line:84%
And with most people
within six months,

00:31:20.713 --> 00:31:23.449 align:middle line:84%
their whole financial
situation is turned around.

00:31:23.449 --> 00:31:26.318 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing a
simple thing like that.

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:29.221 align:middle line:84%
You know, but it's sort of like
tithing to the church of you.

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.424 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that you're the
valuable product in your life

00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:34.526 align:middle line:90%
and letting that occur.

00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:36.729 align:middle line:84%
And you start functioning
from that,

00:31:36.729 --> 00:31:38.831 align:middle line:84%
and a whole different
universe opens up for you.

00:31:38.831 --> 00:31:42.067 align:middle line:84%
And money starts to flow in your
life in ways you never thought.

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:44.203 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us has a
certain amount of money

00:31:44.203 --> 00:31:47.072 align:middle line:84%
that once we hit
that, we think --

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:49.308 align:middle line:84%
at that point we
feel we have money.

00:31:49.308 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then money just starts
to flow in our lives.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.979 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you think,
oh, my god, I have no money,

00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:56.615 align:middle line:84%
let's see what are you
telling the universe with that?

00:31:56.615 --> 00:31:57.616 align:middle line:90%
You have no money.

00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:58.817 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:31:58.817 --> 00:32:00.386 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get, no money.

00:32:00.386 --> 00:32:02.321 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
I was talking

00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:03.455 align:middle line:90%
with a lady the other day.

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:04.957 align:middle line:84%
And I said so what
are you asking for?

00:32:04.957 --> 00:32:06.258 align:middle line:90%
She said more money.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.693 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's not
going to get you anything.

00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:09.428 align:middle line:90%
You want more paying clients.

00:32:09.428 --> 00:32:10.729 align:middle line:90%
She goes what?

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:12.197 align:middle line:84%
I said are you asking
the universe

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:13.399 align:middle line:90%
for more paying clients.

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I said ask the universe.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.935 align:middle line:84%
Okay, universe, what would it
take for ten new paying clients

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:19.204 align:middle line:90%
to show up in my life this week?

00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:21.807 align:middle line:84%
And she went, but
that's too easy.

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.509 align:middle line:90%
And I said that's the problem.

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:25.911 align:middle line:84%
You think that money that
comes easy is somehow wrong.

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:29.081 align:middle line:84%
No, money that comes
anyway is fine.

00:32:29.081 --> 00:32:31.917 align:middle line:84%
You know, people don't get
that they don't invite money.

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like if you were
having a party and you said,

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.822 align:middle line:90%
come over to my party.

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:39.224 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to sing.

00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:40.592 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to dance.

00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:42.327 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
have any music.

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:45.597 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to have
any food, but we'll try

00:32:45.597 --> 00:32:47.933 align:middle line:90%
to have some fun maybe.

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:49.034 align:middle line:90%
Would you go?

00:32:49.034 --> 00:32:51.136 align:middle line:90%
No. Well, money's the same way.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:54.039 align:middle line:84%
Money goes to the
party of happiness.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:56.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So when
there's no lack

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:58.977 align:middle line:84%
and when there is
just the gratitude

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:01.013 align:middle line:84%
of what's already
there or it's --

00:33:01.013 --> 00:33:03.382 align:middle line:84%
I think your taking
it a step further.

00:33:03.382 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Yeah, this is a
step further because it's not

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.385 align:middle line:84%
about the gratitude
for what's there.

00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:09.988 align:middle line:84%
It's a recognition that as
you ask, so shall you receive.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.758 align:middle line:84%
So if you are going
I have no money,

00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:14.426 align:middle line:84%
then that's what going
to show up, no money.

00:33:14.426 --> 00:33:18.464 align:middle line:84%
If you go, wow, I'm getting
rich and richer every day.

00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:22.301 align:middle line:84%
And what would it take
for that to show up?

00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:24.636 align:middle line:84%
And live in that question
of what am I going to have

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.138 align:middle line:90%
to be or do different?

00:33:26.138 --> 00:33:29.074 align:middle line:84%
I ask every day, what do I have
to be or do different today

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:31.243 align:middle line:84%
to create a whole lot
more money right away?

00:33:31.243 --> 00:33:32.811 align:middle line:90%
And weird things happen.

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:39.384 align:middle line:84%
Like recently my secretary said
you've got to join Medicare.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.954 align:middle line:84%
I said I'm not going
to ever use it.

00:33:41.954 --> 00:33:44.623 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't believe in
regular doctors number one.

00:33:44.623 --> 00:33:46.525 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to use Medicare.

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:48.026 align:middle line:84%
It's like why do
I have to do it?

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.595 align:middle line:84%
Because you're insurance
company's going

00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:50.629 align:middle line:90%
to cancel you if you don't.

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:52.097 align:middle line:90%
Okay, fine.

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So she made an online
thing for me.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.502 align:middle line:90%
A guy calls me and he, you know,

00:33:56.502 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
he wants me to tell
him something.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.572 align:middle line:84%
Okay, fine, yep, yep,
yep, that, that, that.

00:34:00.572 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:90%
He says and have you signed

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.775 align:middle line:84%
up for social security,
and I said no.

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:04.776 align:middle line:90%
I make too much money.

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.145 align:middle line:90%
I'll just -- you know, it's

00:34:06.145 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
like I'm already
paying taxes who cares?

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.117 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, it's like
the realty is - you're right now

00:34:12.117 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
at your particular thing your
scheduled for $1,600 a month.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.289 align:middle line:84%
And I can back date
that for six months

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:20.191 align:middle line:90%
which means you'll get $16,000.

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Nice. Say what?

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.062 align:middle line:90%
Okay. I'll take it.

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.298 align:middle line:84%
But it's like I was
not looking at Medicare

00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:28.100 align:middle line:84%
because I know I'm
not going to use it.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.169 align:middle line:84%
I was not looking
at social security

00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:31.937 align:middle line:84%
because I'm making
lots of money.

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:34.238 align:middle line:84%
So those things weren't
a necessity

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.208 align:middle line:90%
for me so I didn't bother.

00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:38.376 align:middle line:84%
But when he started asking the
questions then he told me I was

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:39.411 align:middle line:90%
going to get $16,000.

00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:41.113 align:middle line:90%
I can use $16,000 thanks.

00:34:41.113 --> 00:34:42.447 align:middle line:84%
But I'd been asking
what would it take

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
for a whole lot more
money to show

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.685 align:middle line:90%
up in my life two days before.

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:48.019 align:middle line:90%
And the day before.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.086 align:middle line:90%
And that day.

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.488 align:middle line:90%
And I got a call.

00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:53.392 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, okay,
thank you universe

00:34:53.392 --> 00:34:56.428 align:middle line:90%
for showing me how it works.

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:57.629 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And even though --

00:34:57.629 --> 00:35:00.532 align:middle line:84%
even a bad situation
can be transformed

00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:01.567 align:middle line:90%
so everything is useful.

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:02.834 align:middle line:90%
Basically everything that comes

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.236 align:middle line:84%
to us there's a good
reason for that.

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.972 align:middle line:84%
Let's deepen that experience
or let's open that experience.

00:35:06.972 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Open the door to
different possibilities.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.676 align:middle line:84%
See one of the things that
I do is I always ask, okay,

00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:12.544 align:middle line:84%
so how does it get
any better than this?

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:14.613 align:middle line:84%
And it's like with the
question how's it get any better

00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:17.049 align:middle line:84%
than this all kinds of
amazing things show up.

00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:19.484 align:middle line:84%
So like I was in New
York, and I was trying

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.919 align:middle line:90%
to get a rent control apartment.

00:35:20.919 --> 00:35:23.288 align:middle line:84%
And I kept going,
okay, so I'm going

00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:24.623 align:middle line:84%
to get this rent
control apartment.

00:35:24.623 --> 00:35:27.259 align:middle line:84%
And I kept going -- I kept
trying to find this place,

00:35:27.259 --> 00:35:30.028 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't find it, okay?

00:35:30.028 --> 00:35:32.497 align:middle line:84%
And this time I didn't ask
how does it get any better

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:33.332 align:middle line:90%
than this.

00:35:33.332 --> 00:35:34.666 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't find this apartment.

00:35:34.666 --> 00:35:38.437 align:middle line:84%
I had to go by it ten times
before I was able to see it.

00:35:38.437 --> 00:35:43.041 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't ask what's right
about this I'm not getting.

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I went in, and I
rented the apartment.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.412 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
to be a disaster

00:35:47.412 --> 00:35:50.249 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
ask what's right

00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:51.783 align:middle line:90%
about this I'm not getting.

00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:54.987 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't ask what
else is possible here.

00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's like had I done that,

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.425 align:middle line:84%
I would never had
gotten into that.

00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:01.793 align:middle line:90%
But I had made up my mind.

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:03.862 align:middle line:84%
I decided, I concluded that
that was the right thing.

00:36:03.862 --> 00:36:09.935 align:middle line:84%
And it's like after that I
started asking questions.

00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:11.336 align:middle line:84%
What's right about
this I'm not getting?

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:12.571 align:middle line:84%
What's right about
me I'm not getting?

00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:13.839 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's like
how many times have you said

00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:16.675 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, oh,
I'm so wrong here.

00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:17.809 align:middle line:90%
What if you're not wrong?

00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:19.344 align:middle line:84%
What if what your
choosing is exactly right?

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:23.315 align:middle line:84%
And it's like my passing
this apartment ten times was

00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:24.683 align:middle line:90%
exactly right.

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.551 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't ask what's right
about this I'm not getting.

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:29.054 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had really
gotten that passing it

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:30.756 align:middle line:84%
up was what I really
needed to do,

00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:33.392 align:middle line:84%
I would not have had the
financial disaster I had

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:37.929 align:middle line:84%
as a result of it --
different possibilities.

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Your latest
book are "The Keys

00:36:39.898 --> 00:36:41.166 align:middle line:90%
to Freedom," is that right?

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:43.368 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: "Ten Keys to
Total Freedom," yeah.

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What was that freedom?

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Well, freedom
is the ability to choose.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.977 align:middle line:84%
And freedom is the
ability to do anything.

00:36:51.977 --> 00:36:55.147 align:middle line:84%
And it's like these
keys are things like --

00:36:55.147 --> 00:36:57.716 align:middle line:84%
the first one is would
an infinite being truly

00:36:57.716 --> 00:36:58.984 align:middle line:90%
choose this?

00:36:58.984 --> 00:37:01.286 align:middle line:84%
Are you functioning as infinite
being or a finite being?

00:37:01.286 --> 00:37:02.888 align:middle line:90%
How are you functioning in life?

00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:04.389 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know a lot
of people who function

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:07.759 align:middle line:84%
like they're some kind of weird
[inaudible] in the universe

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:09.661 align:middle line:90%
that nobody cares about.

00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:12.531 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like what are you
going to create from that?

00:37:12.531 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So you got to get that there's
a whole different universe

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.435 align:middle line:90%
that's available.

00:37:16.435 --> 00:37:17.969 align:middle line:84%
And we got to ask
those questions.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.005 align:middle line:84%
And we got to look at would
an infinite being truly

00:37:20.005 --> 00:37:21.106 align:middle line:90%
choose this.

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:23.508 align:middle line:84%
Would an infinite being
truly be devastated

00:37:23.508 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:90%
about a relationship that ends?

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.845 align:middle line:84%
No, they'd probably look
around and go, okay,

00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:28.246 align:middle line:90%
what else is possible?

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this morning
a man that you met --

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.220 align:middle line:84%
it's like he'd just broken
up, and he was all depressed.

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.621 align:middle line:90%
You know and I said to him --

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:38.523 align:middle line:84%
I said, okay, so would you let
me do a little processing on you

00:37:38.523 --> 00:37:39.458 align:middle line:90%
to make you feel better?

00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I said so how many
lies did you buy

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.929 align:middle line:90%
to make this relationship work?

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.063 align:middle line:90%
He goes one.

00:37:45.063 --> 00:37:46.798 align:middle line:90%
I said no you didn't.

00:37:46.798 --> 00:37:47.933 align:middle line:90%
About a gazillion.

00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:49.134 align:middle line:90%
So we just [inaudible].

00:37:49.134 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And he goes okay, yes.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.339 align:middle line:84%
I go okay, everything
[inaudible].

00:37:54.339 --> 00:37:59.077 align:middle line:84%
And I said so when did you
realize this relationship wasn't

00:37:59.077 --> 00:38:00.445 align:middle line:90%
going to work?

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:02.581 align:middle line:84%
Three months before you got
together or three months after?

00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
He went, oh, three
months before.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So you'd gotten into
it for what reason?

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.156 align:middle line:90%
Because she wanted me to commit.

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:14.226 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Is that your best choice?

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:15.827 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that to yourself.

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:18.263 align:middle line:84%
Don't, you know, don't lock
yourself up with those kind

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:20.065 align:middle line:90%
of decisions and choices.

00:38:20.065 --> 00:38:22.367 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you got
to look at what is.

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:24.369 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's like
and then, you know,

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.605 align:middle line:84%
everything's just an
interesting point of view.

00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:29.174 align:middle line:84%
If you look at your lover's
life as an interesting point

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:31.276 align:middle line:84%
of view whether they're
right or wrong,

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:33.011 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
to make them wrong.

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:33.945 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make them right.

00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:34.946 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make you wrong.

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:37.215 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
make you right.

00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:39.584 align:middle line:84%
All you do is see and go,
wow, that isn't working.

00:38:39.584 --> 00:38:41.052 align:middle line:90%
Why would you choose that?

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.387 align:middle line:84%
Would an infinite
being choose that?

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:43.622 align:middle line:90%
Okay, are you having fun?

00:38:43.622 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like if
somebody's doing trauma

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.259 align:middle line:90%
and drama is it fun for them?

00:38:47.259 --> 00:38:50.295 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I had somebody call me
I'm going to commit suicide.

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Good. What kind of
gun you going to use?

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.198 align:middle line:90%
I'm not using a gun.

00:38:53.198 --> 00:38:55.567 align:middle line:84%
So what are you going
to use poison?

00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:58.236 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
they go, well, maybe.

00:38:58.236 --> 00:38:59.971 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, do you need
some help on figuring

00:38:59.971 --> 00:39:03.475 align:middle line:84%
out which ones going to be the
easiest and the less painful?

00:39:03.475 --> 00:39:05.444 align:middle line:84%
What? You're not going
to try and stop me?

00:39:05.444 --> 00:39:08.713 align:middle line:84%
No. If you want to commit
suicide, I'm all for it.

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:09.748 align:middle line:90%
I hate you.

00:39:09.748 --> 00:39:13.385 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Did they commit suicide?

00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
No. They were looking
for sympathy.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.522 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, I don't
give sympathy.

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:18.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I get that.

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So no compassion?

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.596 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: Compassion
is superiority.

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:26.198 align:middle line:84%
You always have to judge
somebody as less than you

00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
to be compassionate
towards them.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou:.

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.369 align:middle line:90%
Awesome. The present moment.

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.538 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people speak about
being in the present moment.

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.840 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: Yeah, good luck.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.975 align:middle line:84%
You know, 99 percent of the
people couldn't be present

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:38.944 align:middle line:84%
in their lives if their
life depended on it.

00:39:38.944 --> 00:39:40.145 align:middle line:90%
You know it's like, yeah,

00:39:40.145 --> 00:39:41.346 align:middle line:84%
it's great to be
present in the moment.

00:39:41.346 --> 00:39:42.581 align:middle line:84%
But the only way you're
going to get that is

00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:44.950 align:middle line:90%
by practicing something.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.052 align:middle line:84%
Everything is only
good for ten seconds.

00:39:47.052 --> 00:39:49.855 align:middle line:84%
If you make every choice
for only ten seconds,

00:39:49.855 --> 00:39:51.189 align:middle line:90%
then you can change it.

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:53.658 align:middle line:84%
If you try to make it more
than ten seconds, then you try

00:39:53.658 --> 00:39:56.261 align:middle line:84%
to hold on to the
rightness or wrongness of it.

00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So if you start functioning

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.832 align:middle line:84%
in ten second increments you
can be present with everything.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:03.134 align:middle line:84%
But it's like as long as
you have a point of view

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's something right or
wrong about what your choosing

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:09.007 align:middle line:84%
or what has to be
chosen, you're dead meat.

00:40:09.007 --> 00:40:12.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The horses -- I want
to finish with the horses.

00:40:12.477 --> 00:40:15.881 align:middle line:84%
What did they teach you,
because you love them obviously?

00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:17.282 align:middle line:84%
You have so many
around here and --

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:20.819 align:middle line:84%
>> G.D.: The thing
about horses is they

00:40:20.819 --> 00:40:22.854 align:middle line:90%
communicate telepathically.

00:40:22.854 --> 00:40:24.756 align:middle line:84%
So what you think
is what you get.

00:40:24.756 --> 00:40:27.092 align:middle line:84%
So if you think you're
afraid or if you're angry,

00:40:27.092 --> 00:40:29.694 align:middle line:84%
the horse will give you
anger or it'll give you fear.

00:40:29.694 --> 00:40:31.496 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you want to
be present with the horse.

00:40:31.496 --> 00:40:34.266 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing a horse does
is require you to be present.

00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:36.635 align:middle line:84%
You can't checkout
while riding a horse,

00:40:36.635 --> 00:40:38.203 align:middle line:90%
otherwise you'll get hurt.

00:40:38.203 --> 00:40:42.541 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing about horses
is there's a kindness in them.

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:43.875 align:middle line:90%
They want to take care of us.

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:44.976 align:middle line:90%
You know it's like --

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:46.912 align:middle line:84%
and they're infinite
beings who have chose.

00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:48.046 align:middle line:90%
So before I get on a horse,

00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:49.514 align:middle line:84%
I say will you take
care of me today?

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:51.917 align:middle line:90%
And the horse goes sure.

00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:53.585 align:middle line:84%
You know, because they
know that's their job is

00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:54.619 align:middle line:90%
to take care of us.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:55.554 align:middle line:90%
But people don't ask.

00:40:55.554 --> 00:40:56.688 align:middle line:90%
They decide to get on them.

00:40:56.688 --> 00:40:58.356 align:middle line:84%
And they kick them, and
they do all this stuff.

00:40:58.356 --> 00:41:00.091 align:middle line:90%
I never kick my horse.

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:01.927 align:middle line:90%
I ask of him can we do this?

00:41:01.927 --> 00:41:02.761 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this?

00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:03.428 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this?

00:41:03.428 --> 00:41:04.796 align:middle line:90%
Can we do this?

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:07.632 align:middle line:84%
And it's like -- and he always
does it because I'm asking.

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:08.934 align:middle line:90%
And that's the other thing.

00:41:08.934 --> 00:41:11.303 align:middle line:84%
Horses are a great way to
learn how to be in question.

00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:13.705 align:middle line:84%
Because if you function from
question, what they will do

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:16.007 align:middle line:84%
for you will knock
your socks off.

00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:17.609 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, you're in trouble.

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I watched a lady at this
jumping competition.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.252 align:middle line:84%
And she -- and it's like
before the competition she said

00:41:27.252 --> 00:41:29.988 align:middle line:84%
that bicycle jump it's
going to be really bad.

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:31.556 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's the
one your horse is going

00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:32.591 align:middle line:90%
to refuse on.

00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:33.925 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:41:33.925 --> 00:41:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The horse refused on it because
she had already decided it

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.861 align:middle line:90%
was bad.

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So the horse looked at it and
goes what's wrong with this --

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.465 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like the horse
functions from, you know,

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:41.566 align:middle line:90%
what do you want from me.

00:41:41.566 --> 00:41:44.469 align:middle line:84%
And it's like -- and
she's going this is bad.

00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:45.804 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:41:45.804 --> 00:41:47.372 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the horse
is going to see it.

00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:48.740 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.776 align:middle line:84%
And if the horse sees it as
bad do they want to go over it?

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:54.546 align:middle line:84%
No. So it's like she wondered
why she didn't do well

00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:90%
in the show?

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.615 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd already
decided she was going

00:41:56.615 --> 00:41:58.717 align:middle line:90%
to do bad by her point of view.

00:41:58.717 --> 00:41:59.517 align:middle line:90%
She didn't ask me a question.

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:00.852 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell her.

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:04.456 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned over time
don't tell people what they

00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:05.657 align:middle line:90%
can't hear.

00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:07.459 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I really enjoyed
this conversation, Gary.

00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.028 align:middle line:90%
>> G.D.: Thank you this was fun.

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:12.364 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for inviting my
friend to be with us.

00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:13.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:42:13.365 --> 00:42:14.766 align:middle line:84%
You were lovely [inaudible
comment].

00:42:14.766 --> 00:42:23.708 align:middle line:84%
[Background Music] Much, much
love my delicious co-creators.

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Bye.
