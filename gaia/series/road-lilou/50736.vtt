00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Lilou, I'm on the road.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
On the road.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Always on the road there's
so many beautiful people

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:90%
to speak to and discover.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.801 align:middle line:84%
It's such a delight to be
sitting next to you, Pierre,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Really, very, very much so.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I feel already
this is going to be

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
an amazing, beautiful
conversation from the heart.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.859 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being you.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PIERRE PRADERVAND:
Thank you, Lilou

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
for inviting me to
do this with you.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
I knew before meeting
you that we're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:10%
going to have a
fantastic contact.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:10%
And it just happened the
second we saw each other.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:10%
So it's great to be doing
an interview with someone

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:10%
with whom one feels quite
on the same wavelength.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You have been
traveling the world,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:10%
and did so many things in your
life, and wrote many books.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.529 align:middle line:90%
Over 15 books, is that right?

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:84%
You're passionate
about human beings.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe
even your work?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: Oh, I would say
that-- if I had to summarize,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
the whole aim of
my life is working

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
towards a world
that works for all.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean that is the goal of my
life at the present moment.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:90%
A world that works for all.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And that implies, of course,
huge changes in so many areas,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and especially on
the spiritual level.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I think ultimately,
the whole goal,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
the whole aim of humankind is
towards greater and greater

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
spiritualization of
everything-- of activities,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:90%
of our way of being, thinking.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Going beyond
the material world.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PRADERVAND: Yes.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the real reality is
of a purely spiritual nature.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I've been a spiritual
seeker for over 40 years,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and I've had, what
one might call,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:90%
about 40 mystical experiences.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.205 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were so
powerful that I cannot doubt

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
a second that there's another
reality beyond the appearances

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.642 align:middle line:90%
of everyday.

00:02:29.642 --> 00:02:31.594 align:middle line:84%
I could, for instance,
share one I shared--

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah, please.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely want
to get into that world.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.249 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: The one I shared
in our French interview,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:10%
if you don't mind, because it's
the most powerful experience

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:10%
in my whole life.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:10%
I've lived 11 years
in Africa, and I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:10%
was on the board of,
what was in the '90s,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:10%
the largest peasant farmer
organization in Africa,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:10%
based in Burkina Faso.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And I was attending a board
meeting of this organization.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:10%
And the last day-- I was
living then in Switzerland.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.992 align:middle line:10%
The last day I caught
dysentery, which it's not

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:10%
dangerous at the beginning,
but it's a great nuisance

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:10%
because you have to run
to the loo the whole time.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did my spiritual
work, because for 40 years

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I healed myself solely
by spiritual means.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
everything was cleared up.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning
when I went to airport,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:90%
it started all over again.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.745 align:middle line:84%
And on the plane I was working
with my spiritual text,

00:03:37.745 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:84%
my affirmations, my mantras,
meditating, praying.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Doing all the right things.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting next to
a little boy, unaccompanied

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
little boy with
this little board

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
with his name, phone
and everything.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And the stewardess taking care
of him was so loving, so sweet,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
as if you were his mother.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And at one moment she
came to speak to him

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:84%
with special tenderness,
and suddenly I

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
felt this incredible influx of
gratitude towards this woman.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And just as suddenly,
this gratitude

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:90%
was transformed into feeling.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean a feeling of cosmic love.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was suddenly outside
the plane, outside of time,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:90%
in a space out there.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the only sense I had
of anything was love.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I felt this love as the
only cause, the only means,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the only end, the
only substance,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
the only everything
of the universe.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.012 align:middle line:84%
And I no other consciousness,
but that of love.

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And the most wonderful thing.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Any sense of existing
as Pierre Pradervand

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%
had totally disappeared.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
It was an egoless state.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And the divine consciousness
was my consciousness.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
That's why it was the most
powerful experience in my life,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
because I no longer
had any sense of ego.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I came back into
the plane, back into time,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and I felt something
adjusting in my bowels,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and in a matter of
seconds, the dysentery

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.139 align:middle line:90%
had completely vanished.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
power of the experience

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.304 align:middle line:84%
was not the
healing-- the healing

00:05:30.304 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:90%
was a nice secondary effect.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But the power was
this sense that love

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:90%
is the ultimate ground of being.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I love Paul
Tillich's expression,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
"the ground of being--"
something very solid,

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
very firm.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Paul Tillich was one of the
great writers who inspired me

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.455 align:middle line:84%
when I was a
journalist in my 20s,

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and I always acknowledge
my debt towards him.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.125 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What do you
think provoked that?

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Did you try to really
analyze this moment

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:90%
when you lived that situation?

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Was that the suffering was
at this moment of gratitude?

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.065 align:middle line:10%
I mean would you try
on a regular basis

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:12.439 align:middle line:10%
to relive those experiences?

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: These
experiences, when

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.240 align:middle line:10%
you study the lives
of spiritual seekers,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:10%
are pure moments of grace.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:10%
You cannot concoct them.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say I'm going to
prepare myself by three hours

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
of meditation and then I will
receive a great revelation.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
It is total grace.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But what opened me up
to grace was gratitude.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.035 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible to
feel gratitude and have,

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:41.963 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, any
negativity in your mind.

00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude eliminates
automatically.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I read magazines
on spiritually healing,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and there are
constantly healings

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.987 align:middle line:84%
which have come
through gratitude.

00:06:57.987 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You were in the
space, so you describe it

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as cosmic love, this
place where you were?

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more because
this quite divine.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I hear people having near
death experience also go

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:90%
through this place, huh?

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, there
really aren't any words

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
from the normal
language because it

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
is in a completely
different space, where

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
words, even thinking
is totally unnecessary.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
That is something
that I've just started

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
discovering, in part thanks
to Joel Goldsmith who's

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I think a respected spiritual
thinker in the states,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that when you are on that level
of a divine transcendence,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:90%
thinking automatically stops.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The brain, the mind function,
rational, Cartesian function

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
disappears
completely, and one is

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:90%
on the level of pure feeling.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Not emotion.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Feeling, which is something
much more deep, much deeper.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And it's like we're
all connected, this infinite?

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:10%
Like there's all knowing,
all love, all connection?

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:10%
Because we have those
moments, not quite as maybe

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:10%
perfect and pure, but
we have those moments

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.719 align:middle line:10%
when we look at nature,
when we look at a child.

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PRADERVAND: Yeah.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I think many people have
little glimpses of this,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
little flashes of
this in everyday life.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:84%
It can be on the bus just
feeling compassion for someone.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
It can be the song of a child,
or a music you hear suddenly.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
There's so many ways this grace
operates in people's lives.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:10%
Thank God, you don't
have to be a great mystic

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.610 align:middle line:10%
to have these little
intuitions of something

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:10%
else, of another level,
of another reality

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.933 align:middle line:10%
behind the material appearance.

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Is that
what's behind a veil?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:10%
Or does it get really
thinner and thinner?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And how do you live right
now, because you speak,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.985 align:middle line:10%
you're all about living, I
would say, vivre autrement.

00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:06.735 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Yes.

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:07.901 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Living differently.

00:09:07.901 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND:
Living differently.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:10%
I like the image you
used of the veil,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:10%
because it's an
image that is used

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:10%
by many mystics and
spiritual thinkers.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:10%
That we live in a world
which is somewhere,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:10%
has nothing to do
with real reality.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:10%
Real reality is behind the veil.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And this real reality is
totally harmonious and whole

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:10%
and joyful and perfect
and infinite love.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:10%
So what I've been doing
for the past 50 years,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:10%
exactly, this year-- I started
working 50 years ago-- what

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing, at least
consciously for the past 30

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:10%
years, is working towards
a world that works for all.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Because either we build a
world that works for all,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:10%
or soon it will work for nobody.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:10%
Even I saw it recently
on internet TV

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.270 align:middle line:10%
of one of the 85 richest
men on the planet.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Oxfam, the British
organization, calculated

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:10%
for the famous meeting
they have in Davos of world

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:10%
deciders every winter.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:29.140 align:middle line:10%
They calculated that 85
people, men, on this planet

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:10%
have wealth equivalent to
that of half the world's

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:10%
population-- 3.5 billion people.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:45.720 align:middle line:10%
And this was the interview
of one of the 85 richest men.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:10%
And the woman interviewing
him said, "Well,

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:10%
how do you react to this
idea, to this fact--

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:10%
you and your friends."

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "Oh, I thought
that was absolutely wonderful.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:10%
It proves that you just have to
pull your socks up and decide

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:10%
to work for it."

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:10%
And she said, "But
in the shantytowns

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:10%
they don't have any
socks to pull up."

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:10%
And I felt great
compassion for this man,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:10%
because he's so in a
world of total artifact.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:10%
I mean can you think
you have, I don't

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.200 align:middle line:10%
know how many
billions of billions

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:10%
of, maybe hundreds of
billions of dollars, he has.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:10%
And he's still
trying to get more.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:10%
He's passing aside from life.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine
he's really living

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
if his only aim is
accumulating more.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Where is beauty?

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Where is poetry?

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Where are warm,
loving relationships?

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So I feel great compassion
for someone like that.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:10%
So to come back to
my basic thrust,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:10%
creating a world
that works for all,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:10%
I think it is one aim
that could ultimately

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:10%
unite all of humanity.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:10%
We've, for so many
centuries, looked

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:10%
for goals that
could unite people.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:10%
Religions have
attempted to do this.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:10%
At the same time,
they've divided

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:10%
people more than
maybe anything else.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:10%
So we have to find
a common ground,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:10%
and for me a world that
works for all could

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:10%
be common ground where
absolutely everyone agrees

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:10%
upon the aim.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:10%
It's been my privilege to travel
or work or do research or live

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.411 align:middle line:10%
in over 40 countries
of the five continents.

00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:49.910 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Now you
are in Switzerland,

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:10%
but that wasn't always the case.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: No.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:10%
And I really think
it's been my privilege

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:10%
to talk to so many people
of so many different kinds

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:10%
of backgrounds, from
prostitutes, to presidents.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:10%
And I think that is one
idea that could really

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:10%
enable the whole of
humanity to pull together

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:10%
to work towards a world
that works for all.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:10%
There would be quite
a, I think, opposition

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:10%
from some economic powers,
because the inequality seems

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:10%
to advantage a small handful
of the world's population.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:10%
But that's just the seeming.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:10%
I really believe that this
is the most pressing agenda

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:10%
for the world today.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:10%
Because, again, as
I said a moment ago,

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:10%
if we don't create
a world that works

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:10%
for all, well, one of these
days, it'll work for nobody.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking of possible
major financial crisis,

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:10%
economic challenges,
ecological-- huge ecological

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.345 align:middle line:10%
challenges if we don't
rapidly change our lifestyles.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: If you had the
President of the United States,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:10%
for example, in
front of you and you

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.760 align:middle line:10%
wanted to convey that
message or like a shift maybe

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:10%
in the population, or
something that will really

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:10%
switch his mind and start
to really support America

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and the rest of the world
in a different way, what

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:10%
conversation would you
have with him really?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well,
that's a really tough one.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
First, I--

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: But on the
human being side.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: First,
I-- Barack Obama,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't want
to be in his shoes.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I pray for him very, very often.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I've admired him from the
very first day he took office.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think he came into an
extremely difficult situation.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But to be honest, I don't
think he's pulling the strings,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
powers in the shade,

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:84%
be they political or
economic, especially,

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
who are really
pulling the strings.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would tell him--
he's a good communicator,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and I think he could maybe
try to communicate this idea.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would say to any
president in the world today.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Put this as a number one aim
of your country's policies,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.070 align:middle line:84%
be it nationally
or internationally.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:10%
That's my key
message, if you want.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And at the
core, how do you

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:10%
convey this to a large public?

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.130 align:middle line:10%
Like if you wanted
to say that, how

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:10%
do you get people from this
pessimism and this way of being

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:10%
in the, seeing themselves in a
crisis and this material world,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:10%
to opening up to seeing
that we're really all there,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:10%
all together, and there
is another reality?

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:10%
How do you do this, this jump?

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, I think
you are doing part of it.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:10%
I think communication is one
of the most important things

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:10%
in the world today.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:10%
And internet has completely,
and I mean completely

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:10%
transformed world history.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:10%
It's difficult to see this
in a historical perspective,

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:10%
but I'm quite sure that in a
few decades, not to mention

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:10%
centuries, when people
analyze our time,

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:10%
they will say "before
and after internet."

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:10%
And all those who are working
to communicate new ideas, ideas

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:10%
of hope, and optimism,
and goodness,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:10%
like you do the
whole time, Lilou,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:10%
are creating this world
that works for all.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.745 align:middle line:10%
That's why positive
communications is so essential.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:10%


00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.515 align:middle line:10%
I functioned as a
journalist in Africa,

00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:10%
and I had the
experience that you

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:10%
can create another
kind of journalism.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:10%
Normally speaking,
journalists, it

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:10%
is believed that the
popular press has--

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.100 align:middle line:10%
to have the three S's
to thrive-- sports, sex

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.241 align:middle line:10%
and scandal.

00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And I believe you can create
something completely different.

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And with an outstanding
African woman,

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:10%
we created a magazine in
French-speaking Africa, which

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.505 align:middle line:10%
in three years became the
bestselling international

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:10%
magazine without
sport, sex or scandal.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:10%
For instance, we were the
first magazine in Africa

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:10%
to, in the whole of Africa, to
mention female circumcision.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.640 align:middle line:10%
The first one to, in
French-speaking Africa,

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:10%
to speak of family planning,
sex education, the environment,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:10%
and other topics.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.205 align:middle line:10%
So it is possible, but there
has to be a vision and a will.

00:17:46.205 --> 00:17:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Tell us about
those big yeses in life,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:10%
to really say yeses.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about that
moment that you

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:10%
had where you really
had to switch there.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, I'd start
by saying that Dr. David

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:10%
Hawkins, who recently
passed on, for me

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.185 align:middle line:10%
was one of the great, great
seers of the United States

00:18:08.185 --> 00:18:10.935 align:middle line:10%
in the second part
of the last century.

00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I really revere this man
who was a non-dualist

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
in his vision of spirituality.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote that yes is
the most powerful word

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:90%
in the English language.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said the
English language.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you can say that
of language in general.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered this in
a very special experience,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote a whole book
on just the power of yes.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I, at one moment
in my life, I was

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.815 align:middle line:84%
living in one of the most
beautiful spots in Switzerland,

00:18:48.815 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
a little mountain above
the City of Vevey.

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a lovely
balcony overlooking

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.650 align:middle line:84%
the lake, the Alps, forest to
do my jogging just next by.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean it was absolute
complete paradise.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And I moved at one moment
into the center of Geneva

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
onto one of the most
polluted and noisy streets

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:90%
in the whole city.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And doing my jogging there in
winter wasn't very pleasant.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So I purchased one of
these machines which

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:84%
imitates cross
country skiing, and it

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
came with a whole lot
of little brochures,

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
including one on
medical things saying

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.065 align:middle line:84%
make a check-up of
your heart if you

00:19:32.065 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
fear you might
have any problems.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:10%
So I just threw that
into the waste basket,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:10%
and threw myself
into my exercise

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.124 align:middle line:10%
with my usual enthusiasm.

00:19:41.124 --> 00:19:43.820 align:middle line:10%
And after two or three
weeks, I suddenly

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:10%
started to have very
acute chest pains,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:10%
waking up in the middle of the
night with difficulty breathing

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:10%
and feeling of anguish.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:10%
And complete loss of energy.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:10%
Just getting up from an
armchair was a major effort.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:10%
In our family, we had a family
history of angina pectoris,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:10%
and this is typical symptoms
of this problem, which

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:10%
is, you know,
serious, medically.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.060 align:middle line:10%
And for three days I
just dragged myself

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:10%
across the apartment.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was
sitting in an armchair,

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
and we had a beautiful view
over Lake Geneva and the Alps

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, something in
the depths of my being, and I

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:10%
can't give it a word,
a term to describe it,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:10%
just something in
me propelled me up,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:10%
and I stood for four or five
minutes with arms outstretched

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:10%
just saying yes, yes, yes
to everything in my life.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.075 align:middle line:10%
And I was
instantaneously healed.

00:20:55.075 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:10%
And I mean instantaneously.

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:10%
I resumed my cross
country skiing

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:10%
on this machine
immediately, but especially

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:10%
for at least a
year or two, when I

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:10%
walked in the streets,
every second step I

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:10%
would say yes, yes, yes.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:10%
It had become so powerful.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And that's what propelled
me to write a whole book

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.107 align:middle line:10%
on the power of saying yes.

00:21:21.107 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:10%
And does yes-- and we mentioned
that in the French interview,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:10%
but I think it's
important to say it;

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:10%
those no's can be yeses.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes it is important
from self respect, self love,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:10%
and all that, to say no, also.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: I quite agree.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:10%
I think that in the
field, for instance,

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:10%
of when you are faced with a
major social injustice or even

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:10%
a personal one, you have
to say no, of course.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:10%
But that no is a yes
to a hidden value.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Your no to grave injustice,
social injustice,

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.445 align:middle line:10%
is a yes to the value
of justice and equality.

00:22:06.445 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:10%
A no to demand the totally
unreasonable, unconscionable

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:10%
demand put upon you by maybe
a family member or anyone,

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:21.970 align:middle line:10%
or your boss, who knows, is
a yes to your own dignity

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and sense of who you are.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:10%
So of course you have
to say no, but a real no

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.530 align:middle line:10%
is always a yes
to something else.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Hmm.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I would love you to speak
of the art of blessing--

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a gentle
word in there, huh?

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Why so?

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.422 align:middle line:84%
What is that, and what's the
impact, and how does it work?

00:22:43.422 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: Well,
as you say it's

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
called the gentle
art of blessing.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It happened to me-- let me
explain a bit how it happened.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:84%
I was working for
a group of NGOs,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.415 align:middle line:90%
nongovernmental organizations.

00:22:56.415 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That was 30 years ago, over
30 years ago in Switzerland.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was so totally
dedicated to my work.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I even had a camp
bed in my office.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:10%
And I'd often, if I'll miss
the last train to go home,

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:10%
I would sleep there.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:10%
And I wanted to create a roving
exhibit on hunger for schools,

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and there was no
money in the budget.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:10%
And I invested what today
would be at least $25,000

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:10%
of my own pocket because there
was no money in the budget.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And this had never
happened in the history

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:90%
of these organizations.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And the exhibit was very well
accepted, it was acclaimed,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:90%
spoke about it in the press.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I was really utterly
dedicated to my work.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time I
joined a world campaign which

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:84%
started in the United States
called The Hunger Project--

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: --which has the
aim the elimination of hunger.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And the slogan of
The Hunger Project

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
was "the end of hunger
by the year 2000."

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Which if they had really
been real political will

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
on the world level,
would have been possible

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
in the early '80s.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the organizations I worked
for just tested this campaign,

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for-- and
they explained why,

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
but they forbid me to
speak it, mention it

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
in my work in schools.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.335 align:middle line:84%
And I was very sad because
it had a tremendous power

00:24:28.335 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:90%
of mobilization on young people.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But I obeyed because
they were my employers.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But I did continue using the
slogan, "the end of hunger

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
by the year 2000," because I
had close contact with peasant

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.955 align:middle line:84%
organizations in Africa which
had that very same slogan.

00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So I thought if it's good
enough for peasant farmers,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:84%
well, I can use it in
my work in schools.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was
convened to a meeting,

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and this meeting was totally
abnormal, and, in fact,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
it was organized by one fellow
in these organizations who

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:90%
wanted my head.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:90%
He just couldn't put up with me.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And the meeting was convened,
and I was facing this tribunal.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
There were no notes
taken whatsoever.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It was completely,
in terms of it,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
mystery procedures,
completely illegal.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was told
that either I stop

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
saying one can put an end
to hunger by the year 2000,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
just because The Hunger Project
said that, has the same slogan,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:90%
or I quit my job.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And I was just dumbfounded.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.505 align:middle line:84%
I'd never been faced in
such a situation in my life

00:25:46.505 --> 00:25:50.210 align:middle line:84%
where I had to choose between
my work and my conscience.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I said,
no to their demand,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:90%
which was a yes to my integrity.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.580 align:middle line:90%
And I quit my job.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But I developed, in
the following weeks,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.770 align:middle line:84%
the most incredible resentment
towards these people.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It was eating me
up night and day.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd wake in the
morning, start showering

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking about
it, going to the office.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
What psychologists
call an obsession.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:90%
It had become a pure obsession.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing all my
right spiritual disciplines

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.640 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of it,
reading sacred text,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.560 align:middle line:84%
repeating mantras,
praying, meditating.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:90%
And I was getting desperate.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And one day reading the
Sermon on the Mount,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:90%
"Bless those who curse you."

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:90%
Ah, well of course!

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It was so evidently the reply.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And on the spot, I started
blessing these people

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
in their health, in their
joy, in their finances,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.365 align:middle line:84%
in their family life, in
their deepest yearnings.

00:26:54.365 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:90%
In every conceivable way.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.960 align:middle line:84%
At first it was in
the head to obey

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:84%
what I thought was
a revealed command,

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
but then it went down
very rapidly to the heart,

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
because blessing is
100% heart energy.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I insist on this.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, a
few weeks later, I

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:84%
started blessing people in the
street, at the post office,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%
at the supermarket.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I used to take
trains quite often.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I used to go the whole
length of the train

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
both ways just to
be sure to bless

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
every person on that train.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been asked
to give a talk

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to an international
meeting of-- youth meeting

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
in Zurich-- this was in '87,
by the way-- on the theme,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:90%
healing the world.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was preparing
my talk, writing it.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I received
a gust of inspiration.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was literally like
a scribe under orders.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
My pen could hardly
follow the ideas

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that were pouring into me.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote this
one page text called

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.300 align:middle line:90%
"The Gentle Art of Blessing."

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And I started sharing
it in my correspondence,

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
including with a man called
Dr. Gerald Jampolsky, who's

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:84%
an old friend, who
was one of the fathers

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of the self-development
movement in the United States.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
He wrote that incredible
international bestseller,

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Love Is Letting Go of Fear.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And I sent the text
to Jerry, and he

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:84%
started sharing it in his
worldwide correspondence.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I started, in the months
and the years to come,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
receiving letters from
people all over the world,

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and it continues now with
internet 25 years later,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:90%
People just telling me it works.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.870 align:middle line:90%
And it is so simple.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Even children can do it.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite stories
was I received this email

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:84%
from a woman who read
one of my articles

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.880 align:middle line:84%
in "Cygnus" magazine, which
is put out by Cygnus Books.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a superb little magazine
on books published in England.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:10%
And I had wrote about the
gentle art of blessing.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.610 align:middle line:10%
She said look, I am a
mother of two children,

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:10%
and I was pregnant
with a third child.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was having
health challenges,

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and at times I was
getting very short

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:90%
tempered with my two children.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:10%
And I was very upset about
this, but I just sometimes

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:10%
just blew up.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:10%
And I read your article,
and I went into my room

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.090 align:middle line:10%
and just took a few
moments to myself,

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:52.100 align:middle line:10%
something I rarely
was able to do.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:10%
And I heard my young
boy, three-year-old,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:10%
calling to me from the garden.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.560 align:middle line:10%
And I went out and
he ran up to me.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:10%
He threw his arms around my
legs, looked up into my face

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and said, "Mommy, I bless you."

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And I had never pronounced the
word blessing in front of him,

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:10%
she said.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:10%
And I have amazing stories.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:10%
I think of this
friend in Africa who's

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.635 align:middle line:10%
a devout Muslim,
very devout Muslim.

00:30:29.635 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:10%
And who took on to this
blessing thing so immediately.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.690 align:middle line:10%
It was just wonderful.

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.640 align:middle line:10%
And he shared with me
just amazing stories.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.780 align:middle line:10%
He had, I think, one
story of this polygamous

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:10%
woman he meets in
the streets in Mali

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:10%
and other countries of
the area, with a very

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:10%
strong Muslim population.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Mali must be at least
95% Muslim or 90%.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:10%
Men very often take a second
or even third or fourth

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.570 align:middle line:10%
wife, after a certain
number of years.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:10%
And this man was in his 50s and
he had a wife who was aging.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:10%
Excuse me.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:10%
[COUGH] A wife who was getting
on in years, and certainly

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:10%
wasn't as sexy as when he
married her 30 years earlier.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.790 align:middle line:10%
So he just married a young
20-year-old or 22-year-old lady

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:10%
who was, of course, much more
fun for him, quote, unquote,

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.040 align:middle line:10%
"fun."

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.135 align:middle line:10%
And he had started insulting
his wife, beating her.

00:31:37.135 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:10%
And the young wife was
doing the same thing,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.590 align:middle line:10%
being very rude with her
co-wife, whereas she should

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:10%
have respected her for her age.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:10%
And this woman was
absolutely desperate.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.095 align:middle line:10%
And she met my friend
Mamado in the street

00:31:53.095 --> 00:31:55.805 align:middle line:10%
and poured out her
tale of woe to Mamado.

00:31:55.805 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:10%
And who said, "Look,
Fatima, all you have to do

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:10%
is just bless him.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.040 align:middle line:10%
This is how you go about
it," and he explained to her

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:10%
briefly.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:10%
And in Africa,
people who are not

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.970 align:middle line:10%
part of the
westernized elite are

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.190 align:middle line:10%
extraordinarily
receptive to new ideas.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:10%
So receptive, because they
don't have their minds totally

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.145 align:middle line:10%
cluttered up with all
the stuff we have.

00:32:18.145 --> 00:32:22.010 align:middle line:10%
And she went home that evening
and she started sincerely

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:26.780 align:middle line:10%
and honesty blessing her
husband and her co-spouse.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:10%
The next morning the
husband came to her

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:10%
and apologized for
the behavior he'd had.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Promised her not to start.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.870 align:middle line:10%
Started respecting her
and treating her like he

00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:10%
had always done.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:10%
And the co-spouse also
changed completely.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And now the two women are
given as examples of harmony

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.962 align:middle line:10%
in a polygamous marriage in
the whole section of that city.

00:32:57.962 --> 00:32:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: There's no
forgiveness there,

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:10%
or does it instantly happen?

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well,
I think the woman

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.290 align:middle line:10%
didn't feel the need to forgive.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:10%
She just wanted to be
rid of this harassment.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.481 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Free.

00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:13.230 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Be freed
of this harassment.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:17.420 align:middle line:10%
And so she had such a
trust in my friend, who's

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:10%
a very respected person in
that small town called Mopti

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:10%
that she just went ahead
and the miracle happened.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.330 align:middle line:10%
Again, you don't
explain miracles.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:10%
They are movements of grace.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:39.690 align:middle line:10%
But the movements of grace, no
one can foretell or explain.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Intentions
are very powerful if we

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:10%
say at the beginning
of the day, I

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:10%
would love to
experience miracles

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:10%
or I'm living miracles.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:10%
All of a sudden we
kind of witness them.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:10%
How come?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: You pronounced
a word, intention.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:10%
That brings up to me one of
the most powerful stories

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.760 align:middle line:10%
I could share with the viewers.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:10%
I had a very dear
friend in London

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:10%
who was called Doris Henti,
and she was Christian science

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:10%
practitioner.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:10%
She was born in a suburban,
rich suburban area of London

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:10%
in the late 1800s.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And her mother suffered
from chronic depression.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:10%
Her brother had-- I don't
remember what he had,

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:10%
but he was constantly ill.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:10%
And she had a disease of
the bones of the skull.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:10%
And her whole face and skull
were completely distorted.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:84%
She had one eye
higher than the other.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:90%
A nose completely askew.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.939 align:middle line:84%
And her mouth distorted
because of the distorted--

00:34:53.939 --> 00:34:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Chin?

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PRADERVAND: And
her mother discovered

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.350 align:middle line:84%
this book called Science
and Health with Key

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
to the Scriptures, which has
healed thousands of people

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
around the globe
just by reading it.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And she started reading it
and she was instantaneously

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:90%
healed of her depression.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:90%
And the son was healed.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And the progression of
Doris's disease stopped.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:90%
She stopped progression.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.110 align:middle line:84%
She'd had at least
12 operations,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.530 align:middle line:90%
she told me, before that.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And so the whole family
started studying this book.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:10%
And one day she read in a local
newspaper, a London newspaper,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:10%
that a cousin of hers
had won a beauty contest.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can imagine
that in the late 1800s,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.000 align:middle line:10%
they weren't in bikinis, OK?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:10%
They were probably in crinolines
right down to the ankles.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:10%
But still she won the
first beauty contest.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:10%
And Doris told me
the story directly,

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.330 align:middle line:10%
like you are speaking to me.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Doris thought, well, I'm never
going to win a beauty contest.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.740 align:middle line:10%
But I would like to express
the beauty of holiness.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a verse
in the song which

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.330 align:middle line:10%
is repeated three
times about expressing

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:10%
the beauty of holiness.

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:10%
And I would like to remember,
viewers, that holiness,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.279 align:middle line:10%
wholeness and health
are the same root.

00:36:33.279 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:10%
They mean the same thing.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, it means a
state of complete wholeness,

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.580 align:middle line:10%
a balanced harmony
and wholeness.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:10%
She went into her room,
and that was her intention.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:10%
The whole day she held
firm to that intention.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:10%
I wish to express the
beauty of holiness.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.650 align:middle line:10%
The whole day she just
held onto that one idea.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:10%
When she came down
that night for dinner,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.965 align:middle line:10%
the whole bone structure of
her head had adjusted itself.

00:37:07.965 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:10%
I know that's just incredible.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:10%
And this story is told in a book
of her association addresses,

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.912 align:middle line:10%
so people can find
it in writing.

00:37:18.912 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:10%
But I find that to illustrate.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.180 align:middle line:10%
Wayne Dyer who's one
of the great gurus

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.100 align:middle line:10%
of the American personal
development scene, whom

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:10%
I respect greatly has
written a whole book

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:31.490 align:middle line:10%
on the power of intention.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:37.340 align:middle line:10%
It is one of the most
powerful forces in the world.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And again, this is
happening behind the veil.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.720 align:middle line:10%
There is something there
behind in the unseen world

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.020 align:middle line:10%
that is, as soon as
we're connecting,

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:10%
as soon as we're setting an
intention, it's bridging?

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.570 align:middle line:10%
Can we say we receive the help.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:10%
As soon as we ask for help from
life, too, from the cosmos,

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.630 align:middle line:10%
from the universe, from God,
there is-- something happens.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.690 align:middle line:10%
I mean this is quite incredible.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.580 align:middle line:10%
I know scientists
invited on Gaiam,

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.520 align:middle line:10%
everything explained
all this scientifically.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:10%
But for us to express
that and to see it

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.269 align:middle line:10%
and to witness it in our daily
life is of pure beauty, huh?

00:38:14.269 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Absolutely.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And I've had so many experiences
myself of this invisible power

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:10%
acting in one's life for good.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.210 align:middle line:10%
Again, I've had 40
years I healed myself

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:32.475 align:middle line:10%
with this purely
spiritual approach taught

00:38:32.475 --> 00:38:34.760 align:middle line:10%
by this book,
Science and Health.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.400 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm reading
Joel Goldsmith

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:42.290 align:middle line:10%
who's a well-known metaphysician
in the United States

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:47.710 align:middle line:10%
who is in the same frame of
mind of positing that there's

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:10%
another reality behind
the material veil, which

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:10%
is the ultimate reality
of the universe.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So our relationship
to time, money, all of that

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:10%
is really an illusion
could we say?

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, I think
material life, as we live it

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:10.080 align:middle line:10%
today, however real
it may appear is,

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.370 align:middle line:10%
compared to the other level
of reality, totally illusory.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:10%
Many of the great
mystics and saints

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:22.000 align:middle line:10%
speak of the veil that hides
from our view, the real world.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.682 align:middle line:10%
The real world, being
the world of the spirit.

00:39:25.682 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Did you have sometimes
visions or the occasion

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:10%
to live some things or
see it, or do you feel it?

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.420 align:middle line:10%
What is your experience of it?

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.520 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, I
think it has to be felt.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:10%
I shared this one experience I
had of this experience of love,

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:48.130 align:middle line:10%
which for me is the
clearest message

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:10%
I received on the reality of
another level of existence,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:10%
another level of reality
beyond the screen.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:03.140 align:middle line:10%
And I've had maybe 40
experiences during my life

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.703 align:middle line:10%
that you might call,
quote, "mystical,"

00:40:06.703 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that
they refer, again.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:10%
But it's always on
the level of feeling.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.800 align:middle line:10%
I want to insist on that.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:10%
And Joel Goldsmith
in his writings

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:10%
also insists a great
deal on the fact

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:10%
that this true reality is beyond
the level of the mind stuff.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:10%
The mind has to stop
its little bicycle

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.880 align:middle line:10%
and constantly churring, and you
have to go down into the heart

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:10%
and listen.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.330 align:middle line:10%
Listening is the first step.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:10%
And when you've got into a
deep enough level of science

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:10%
then you can start hearing
another message, another voice,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:10%
and feeling, feeling the
existence of another world.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I know when I had the
opportunity to interview Wayne

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Dyer, with Ram Dass
as well in Maui.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.010 align:middle line:10%
During that interview
he's in a wheelchair,

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:04.680 align:middle line:10%
and he was saying that
this is a blessing.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And you really have in front of
you a human being that feels it

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and that means it is you
get that this is really

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:90%
a blessing for him.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And when he says, "I
am loving awareness,

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:90%
I am loving awareness."

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we drop into
this loving awareness,

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
it's like the experience
alters, like a human

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:90%
being can bring another.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:10%
I guess in your workshops
and in your talks,

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:10%
people get into this
space, but sometimes might

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.270 align:middle line:10%
be a little bit harder to live
it on a regular basis for them.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:38.580 align:middle line:10%
But that is a glimpse.

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.410 align:middle line:10%
It's like a seed that
is planted maybe?

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.735 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Last weekend I
had a workshop on forgiveness.

00:41:45.735 --> 00:41:48.850 align:middle line:10%
It was something happened
I never experienced before

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:10%
in 22 years of
running workshops.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:10%
I'd just shared with
the participants

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.535 align:middle line:10%
my favorite prayer.

00:41:58.535 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:10%
It's a little prayer
I made up for myself.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:10%
"Shine as me, and may I be so
thee that all those I encounter

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.360 align:middle line:10%
experience me, as
thy radiant presence,

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.440 align:middle line:10%
thy unconditional
love and forgiveness.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.090 align:middle line:10%
May they no longer see
me, but only, only thee."

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And I just shared
this with the group,

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.490 align:middle line:10%
and told them that this was
my ultimate spiritual goal.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And there was one
woman in the group

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:39.790 align:middle line:10%
who had suffered all
kinds of abuse as a child,

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.340 align:middle line:10%
as a young woman.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.530 align:middle line:10%
And she was in
great, great pain.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:46.710 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly my
little voice said,

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:10%
bring her in to the
middle of the room.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And we formed a
circle around her,

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:10%
and we all put our hands on her.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And then for 20 minutes,
grace took over.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:10%
I don't even
remember what I said,

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:10%
but it was just so amazing.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.510 align:middle line:10%
And everyone felt
what was happening.

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.080 align:middle line:10%
That was the amazing thing.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Everyone was into that energy.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.970 align:middle line:10%
And it was an
awesome experience.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:10%
So when we listen,
when we manage

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.580 align:middle line:10%
to put aside a little
ego a little bit,

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.225 align:middle line:10%
then these things
can be manifested.

00:43:30.225 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Is there a last thing
you want to leave us with,

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:10%
something important to mention
within this conversation

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:10%
about this other way of
living and how we can really

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:10%
live our full
potential, I guess?

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:45.450 align:middle line:10%
But beyond the potential, just
be who we are, really truly?

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:10%
>>PRADERVAND: Well, I would like
to say have a clear intention.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:10%
A really clear intention.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.810 align:middle line:10%
And let nothing,
and I mean nothing

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:10%
get in the way of
that intention.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a lot of hard work.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:07.240 align:middle line:10%
It's not a three
week easy to change

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.920 align:middle line:10%
into a happy being
program that you

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.640 align:middle line:10%
can buy for $40 on internet.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.680 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:10%
It's a long, long road, and
that long road might take you

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:10%
occasionally through
valleys, but there will also

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:10%
be many, many heights
and many summits.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, it's,
for me, the only road

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.040 align:middle line:10%
that's worth treading.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.780 align:middle line:10%
The road towards
a world that works

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.015 align:middle line:10%
for all, built on
harmony and love.

00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'm absolutely
convinced humanity

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:10%
will get there one day.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:10%
I think we might have
some tremendous tsunamis,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:57.450 align:middle line:10%
be they economic or
ecological, but I'm

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:10%
deeply convinced we
will pull through them,

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:10%
and we'll create this world
that works for all one day.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Thank you, Pierre, for
those wise words and words--

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.110 align:middle line:10%
