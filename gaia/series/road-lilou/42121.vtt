>> Lilou: Hello,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:84%
my juicy co-creators, Lilou
here.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.484 align:middle line:84%
I am on the road in England,
in London because there's

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:19.787 align:middle line:84%
so many great teachers and such
a great energy in this big city

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that I have to come back
quite on a regular basis

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.426 align:middle line:84%
and do those videos for Gaiam
TV, a wonderful TV, you know,

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:28.295 align:middle line:84%
online, and I'm excited
to interview you, Charlie.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.097 align:middle line:90%
I heard of your work.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.298 align:middle line:90%
You're a Hay House author.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.969 align:middle line:84%
You wrote "Dreams of
Awakening" and I'm excited

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:90%
to speak of lucid dreaming.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, for all
the lucid dreamers,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.275 align:middle line:84%
the out-of-body experiencers,
you know,

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.512 align:middle line:84%
the conscious sleeping,
my goodness.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:47.415 align:middle line:84%
So, what, how, you know,
I'm very interested to hear

00:00:47.415 --> 00:00:51.185 align:middle line:84%
about your own journey to
this and how it's evolving

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:53.821 align:middle line:84%
and your new approach to
it, etc. But I would love

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.957 align:middle line:84%
to first hear what is actually
lucid dreaming so we're all

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:00.227 align:middle line:84%
on the same page, the
obvious question.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Charlie Morley: So a
lucid dream is a dream

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:03.497 align:middle line:84%
where you know that
you're dreaming.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.633 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a
really vivid dream.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.235 align:middle line:84%
It's not a dream that
you remember very well.

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.004 align:middle line:84%
It's specifically
being in a dream

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.939 align:middle line:90%
and you're, aha, I'm dreaming.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.208 align:middle line:84%
Now once you have that moment
you will often remember the

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
dream very well and the dream
will often be very vivid

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what
makes it lucid.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:20.448 align:middle line:84%
The definition of a lucid
dream is a dream where you go,

00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:23.184 align:middle line:84%
ah I know I'm dreaming as
the dream is happening.

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:25.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you
can ignite it too?

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can want
to dream and you dream

00:01:29.023 --> 00:01:30.723 align:middle line:84%
and that's also called
a lucid dreaming.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
You can do that basically
anytime, day or night?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, yeah,
that's what I do.

00:01:34.462 --> 00:01:36.229 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so teach people
how to have that at work

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.232 align:middle line:84%
because most people might
have had that occasionally,

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:39.567 align:middle line:90%
a spontaneous, lucid dream

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.202 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure most people
watching must say, oh yeah,

00:01:41.202 --> 00:01:42.336 align:middle line:90%
I know that experience.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:43.604 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's happened
once or twice.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I teach is the
techniques to allow people to do

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.509 align:middle line:84%
it at will, so a certain
meditation technique,

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.478 align:middle line:84%
self-hypnosis techniques
and a lot obviously

00:01:50.478 --> 00:01:51.846 align:middle line:90%
from Tibetan Buddhism.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:55.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, how is that
approach different to other ones

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.551 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of
people that teach that,

00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:59.253 align:middle line:84%
obviously you're
a young teacher.

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:90%
How old are you?

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Ah, 30.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:03.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: 30, my
goodness, you look like 20.

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:05.693 align:middle line:90%
Anyway that's awesome.

00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:08.162 align:middle line:84%
Tell me how is your
approach new?

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:15.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well, I combine the
practices of Tibetan Buddhism

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.539 align:middle line:84%
but in a way that's totally
accessible for non-Buddhists.

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.208 align:middle line:84%
So, there's seen to be two
major camps in lucid dreaming,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:25.045 align:middle line:84%
the Western psychological field
which teaches the technique

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.981 align:middle line:84%
to become lucid and
then kind of say, oh,

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:28.448 align:middle line:84%
when you're lucid then
you can fly about.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:29.984 align:middle line:90%
You can meet movie stars.

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:32.253 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can do a bit of
shadow integration stuff

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:35.322 align:middle line:84%
but it's quite, kind
of base level stuff.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:36.757 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the
Tibetan Buddhist stuff

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:38.792 align:middle line:84%
which can sometimes
seem quite inaccessible.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.095 align:middle line:84%
It's about going to the lucid
dream state, transforming

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:43.063 align:middle line:84%
yourself into this deity and
this archetype of compassion --

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:45.432 align:middle line:84%
That can seem quite far
out for a lot of people.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:47.234 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to deal with
something in the middle.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people who want to go
beyond the often-limited scope

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.007 align:middle line:84%
of the Western psychological
view of lucid dreaming

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.377 align:middle line:84%
but aren't quite ready
perhaps or aren't interested

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:58.946 align:middle line:84%
in committing to the full-on
Tibetan dream yoga practices

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.014 align:middle line:90%
but somewhere in the middle,

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:01.749 align:middle line:84%
to make lucid dreaming
a spiritual path,

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
Buddhist, non-Buddhist

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.552 align:middle line:90%
or anything in between.

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:07.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, it's even, what
do you mean by spiritual path?

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:08.923 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like
there's also some growth,

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:13.193 align:middle line:84%
some real personal, you know,
growth and spiritual expansion

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.663 align:middle line:84%
and all of that within because
you can change your life

00:03:15.663 --> 00:03:16.664 align:middle line:90%
through lucid dreaming.

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:17.865 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:19.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah, absolutely,

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.235 align:middle line:84%
I mean once you're lucid you're
conscious in the unconscious

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:23.037 align:middle line:84%
which is a state most
people will only enter

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.774 align:middle line:84%
into in deep-level meditation
and of course in hypnosis.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:30.177 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice metaphor to use
that the hypnotic trance state

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
where the hypnotherapist
will guide an element

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.748 align:middle line:84%
of your conscious mind
into the subconscious

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:36.884 align:middle line:84%
and plant a suggestion
of healing intent.

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Now in a lucid dream you're
doing the same thing but you're

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.055 align:middle line:84%
in the depths of
the unconscious.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:43.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can't get more
unconscious than a sleep.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.259 align:middle line:84%
So if you plant a
suggestion of healing intent

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.862 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream it can work
with often far greater efficacy

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:51.732 align:middle line:84%
than if a hypnotherapist
implanted the suggestion.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Now in no way am I saying

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.735 align:middle line:84%
that makes lucid dreaming
better than hypnotherapy.

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had many years
training in self-hypnosis

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.072 align:middle line:90%
with a wonderful teacher

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:00.708 align:middle line:84%
and actually hypnosis
is more accessible.

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.943 align:middle line:84%
You know, right now we could go
into hypnotic trance within 20

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.179 align:middle line:84%
or 30 minutes, to have
a lucid dream you've got

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.513 align:middle line:84%
to be tired enough
to go to sleep.

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got to go
through the deep-sleep stages.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.183 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got to
enter the dream.

00:04:09.183 --> 00:04:10.484 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know
the practices.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do this, that,
so it's not as accessible

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.155 align:middle line:84%
as hypnosis but once
you're in there,

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.157 align:middle line:84%
because you're planting
the seed of the suggestion

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:84%
so deep it works
very, very powerfully.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.495 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had
somebody just,

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:25.866 align:middle line:84%
coming up to his fifth
month now, of no cigarettes

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:27.001 align:middle line:90%
after six years smoking.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.669 align:middle line:90%
He had one lucid dream and in

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.337 align:middle line:84%
that lucid dream he
planted the suggestion.

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:32.306 align:middle line:84%
He no longer was
addicted to cigarettes

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.308 align:middle line:84%
and that the addiction
no longer served him

00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:35.409 align:middle line:90%
and he lived a healthy,

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.511 align:middle line:84%
beneficial lifestyle,
free of cigarettes.

00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:39.747 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't smoked since that day.

00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:41.482 align:middle line:84%
You know, I bring that
guy out to workshops

00:04:41.482 --> 00:04:42.683 align:middle line:90%
to kind of tell his story.

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:43.917 align:middle line:90%
People don't believe me.

00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:45.719 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's so, so powerful.

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.089 align:middle line:84%
If you can have that lucid dream
you can make lasting changes

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.026 align:middle line:84%
and direct interventions
within your own psychology.

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:55.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes, did you go
into the work with scientists

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:84%
or had some kind
of understanding

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:01.769 align:middle line:84%
of really how all this works
on a more like tangible basis?

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, I mean, that's
what the book is full of.

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The book looks at everything
from three major perspectives,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.743 align:middle line:84%
Western neuroscience,
psychology and Tibetan Buddhism.

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:12.079 align:middle line:84%
So we even looked at the lucid
dream state from the point

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:15.049 align:middle line:84%
of view of neuroscience and
those two other perspectives.

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:16.316 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of science on it.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.918 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is why lucid
dreaming is becoming more

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:84%
popular nowadays
because we have now the

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.188 align:middle line:90%
science to back it up.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:22.523 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's first
scientifically proved

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:24.725 align:middle line:84%
by Keith Hearne in
the early 70s.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:27.094 align:middle line:84%
But, just about two or three
years ago the Max-Planck

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:29.663 align:middle line:84%
Institute and Heidelberg
University in Germany,

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
they started doing functional
magnetic resonance imaging scans

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.035 align:middle line:84%
on lucid dreamers so you could
actually see the moment they

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:36.103 align:middle line:90%
became lucid.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle line:84%
So now we know we're
beyond anecdote.

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.906 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely exists.

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:41.842 align:middle line:84%
We know that it's the right
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.411 align:middle line:84%
that activates within the
dream state thus triggering

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.778 align:middle line:90%
self-reflective awareness.

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.314 align:middle line:90%
So there's no ifs, no buts.

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.349 align:middle line:90%
It's now. It's real.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's science.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How does it look then
compared to the meditative state

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.755 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
brain at that stage?

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Very similar,
if you look at somebody

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.126 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream state they're
in a state of meditation.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:01.595 align:middle line:84%
In fact some of the highest
frequency brainwaves ever

00:06:01.595 --> 00:06:05.532 align:middle line:84%
recorded were in the brain of a
lucid dreaming subject so very,

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:08.135 align:middle line:84%
very high frequency
and every moment spent

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:10.804 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream is a moment
of mindful meditation.

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle line:84%
You know if for one
minute you forget you're

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.275 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream you're
going to slip out, you know,

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:16.576 align:middle line:90%
you're going to wake up.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.512 align:middle line:84%
So there is this constant
awareness of the fact you're

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:20.247 align:middle line:90%
in a dream as you're dreaming.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:22.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How is it
different than the Dream Yoga

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:24.518 align:middle line:84%
that you heard of
because I know you started

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:25.819 align:middle line:84%
and you could maybe
tell us a little bit

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.523 align:middle line:84%
about your story earlier
on at 12, 16 you had kind

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:32.693 align:middle line:84%
of those moments where you
started just naturally,

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
just lucid dreaming but
it was more for fun, huh?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And at some point you
encountered Buddhism?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yes, so let's look at
both aspects of that question.

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.037 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
about Dream Yoga.

00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:46.507 align:middle line:84%
So Dream Yoga is the name
given to a collection

00:06:46.507 --> 00:06:48.509 align:middle line:84%
of practices found
within Tibetan Buddhism

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.677 align:middle line:84%
that have lucid dream
training at their core.

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:53.514 align:middle line:84%
But Dream Yoga contains
both out-of-body experiences

00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:55.482 align:middle line:84%
as we call it in the
West, conscious sleeping

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:57.151 align:middle line:90%
and lucid dream practice.

00:06:57.151 --> 00:07:00.387 align:middle line:84%
Dream Yoga is traditionally
found within certain aspects,

00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:02.823 align:middle line:84%
certain lineages of
Tibetan Buddhism.

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:05.959 align:middle line:84%
When I first got into lucid
dream training at the age

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
of kind of 16, after being aware
of it at 12, but then going back

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.466 align:middle line:84%
to being a 12-year-old and
when about 16 when I got

00:07:12.466 --> 00:07:14.268 align:middle line:84%
into it I wasn't
into any of that.

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I was into about having
sex in the lucid dream

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.939 align:middle line:84%
because a lucid dream is
like super, super realistic.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:21.141 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're in there
and it feels as real as this.

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.476 align:middle line:90%
You can feel your heart beating.

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:24.678 align:middle line:90%
You feel the hair on your arms.

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.079 align:middle line:90%
It's so, so real.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.515 align:middle line:84%
So when you have that as
a 16-year-old you want

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:31.919 align:middle line:84%
to like do what you're into at
16 which for me was just sex.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'd just go into the lucid
dream state and call

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.689 align:middle line:84%
out for like all
these girls to appear

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:38.058 align:middle line:84%
and just spend my whole
lucid dreams having sex.

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:40.594 align:middle line:84%
And luckily a few years
later I got into Buddhism

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:42.528 align:middle line:84%
and somebody mentioned
this term, Dream Yoga,

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:43.931 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, what's
Dream Yoga?

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:45.332 align:middle line:90%
And they explained it.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:48.402 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, well I can do
lucid dream and the monk said,

00:07:48.402 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
you know, what do you
do in your lucid dreams?

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.905 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, you know.

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:53.207 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to tell him.

00:07:53.207 --> 00:07:55.242 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well you know,
what do you do as a monk?

00:07:55.242 --> 00:07:56.443 align:middle line:90%
What are you supposed to do?

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:58.312 align:middle line:84%
And we said, oh we use it
for spiritual practice.

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:01.849 align:middle line:84%
We use it for exploring the
very essence of reality.

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.418 align:middle line:84%
We use it for training and
exploration of emptiness.

00:08:04.418 --> 00:08:05.919 align:middle line:90%
And I was thinking, wow.

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, I had no idea.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.388 align:middle line:84%
I thought this stuff
was just for kind of sex

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:10.424 align:middle line:84%
and skateboarding which is what
I was using it for up till then.

00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly this door
opened and I realized it's

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.629 align:middle line:84%
like I was holding a baby
and going, what does it do?

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:16.997 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:18.699 align:middle line:84%
You know, a baby doesn't really
do anything but you nurture

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:20.868 align:middle line:84%
that baby and you might
have the next Gandhi

00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.769 align:middle line:84%
or next Nelson Mandela
on your hands,

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.705 align:middle line:90%
so too with lucid dreaming.

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a potential
which we can waste

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
on just meeting movie stars
and having sex with elements

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.046 align:middle line:84%
of our self but we can
also go one step further

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:36.516 align:middle line:84%
into deep self-development
and spiritual realization

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.918 align:middle line:90%
in fact while we sleep.

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:39.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, were you able

00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:42.556 align:middle line:84%
to also lucid dream once you
start meditating because I guess

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:46.159 align:middle line:84%
when you start looking at
Tibetan and getting closer

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:51.398 align:middle line:84%
to the, to this Lama, then maybe
you have started

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:52.833 align:middle line:90%
changing your practice?

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah, I mean one

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:55.569 align:middle line:84%
of the original lucid
dream induction techniques

00:08:55.569 --> 00:08:56.904 align:middle line:90%
is meditation.

00:08:56.904 --> 00:08:59.172 align:middle line:84%
You do enough meditation,
you're going to start to have,

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:02.476 align:middle line:84%
kind of clearer dreams and
often spontaneous lucid dreams,

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:05.045 align:middle line:84%
people who do long, extended
periods of meditation.

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.614 align:middle line:84%
So that definitely fills up
the lucidity tank, as it were.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:10.183 align:middle line:84%
And also when I got
into it because I was

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:12.753 align:middle line:84%
into lucid dreaming I was
looking at certain meditations

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:15.689 align:middle line:84%
that were linked to the
Dream Yoga practices.

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:17.124 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
kind of inaccessible

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're not really supposed
to do until you're on retreat

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.728 align:middle line:84%
and stuff but at a young
age I was finding a way

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.698 align:middle line:84%
to find these techs and trying
them out and stuff like that.

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:26.233 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, meditation is
most definitely linked

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:27.568 align:middle line:90%
to the practice.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:30.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, it must have
helped because on going back

00:09:30.637 --> 00:09:32.873 align:middle line:84%
to the brain now,
there's neuroplasticity

00:09:32.873 --> 00:09:34.207 align:middle line:90%
that happening, you becoming.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:37.511 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming easier and
easier I guess as people train.

00:09:37.511 --> 00:09:40.681 align:middle line:84%
They can get quicker into
that stage because it's quite.

00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:44.117 align:middle line:84%
It's quite something I mean
from the outside to think of it

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:46.053 align:middle line:84%
for people that have never
done it, like me, you know.

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:48.922 align:middle line:84%
We're like, wow, how
cool is this stuff?

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah, and it is cool

00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:53.493 align:middle line:84%
and the neuroplasticity thing
is one of the coolest aspects.

00:09:53.493 --> 00:09:55.829 align:middle line:84%
You know, in a non-lucid dream,
let's say you're dreaming

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:58.632 align:middle line:84%
about cycling or something you
might wake up in the morning

00:09:58.632 --> 00:10:01.101 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, I dreamt about
cycling, maybe I'll want

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.903 align:middle line:90%
to go cycling a little bit more

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:04.304 align:middle line:84%
but nothing's really
happened in the brain.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:05.872 align:middle line:90%
If you have a lucid dream

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:09.443 align:middle line:84%
about going cycling the lucid
dream state is so realistic

00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:11.511 align:middle line:84%
that the brain thinks
you're cycling

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.548 align:middle line:84%
so it starts sending
electrical impulses

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:17.584 align:middle line:84%
and increased blood flow to the
muscles engaged with cycling.

00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:19.252 align:middle line:84%
So they've shown that
if you lucid dream

00:10:19.252 --> 00:10:22.522 align:middle line:84%
about riding a bike the next
day you're better at it.

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.257 align:middle line:84%
So you can practice
in the lucid dream

00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:25.926 align:middle line:90%
and learn to become better.

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:28.862 align:middle line:84%
If you do press-ups in the lucid
dream you can increase muscle

00:10:28.862 --> 00:10:30.397 align:middle line:90%
mass in the waking state.

00:10:30.397 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is nuts.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You're leaving lasting
neuro-pathways

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.603 align:middle line:84%
in the very fabric of the brain
based on what you choose to do

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream state.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:39.973 align:middle line:84%
The Heidelberg University, I
mean they have a lot of studies

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
like 350 professional athletes
have been trained to lucid dream

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.912 align:middle line:84%
because they see the
potential and this is so high

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:47.447 align:middle line:84%
because if you can get
better at your sport

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:50.417 align:middle line:84%
in your sleep you've got
like a third, you've got kind

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:51.784 align:middle line:90%
of eight hours extra a night

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:54.254 align:middle line:84%
where you can be training while
the competition is snoozing.

00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How is it better or
more efficient I should say

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.692 align:middle line:90%
than the visualization?

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:01.728 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well, interestingly
the controlled study

00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.964 align:middle line:84%
that we're using in this was
visualized training.

00:11:03.964 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So right now I can visualize
I'm on a bike, right?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.801 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really
visualizing I'm on a bike.

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.003 align:middle line:84%
I feel the handlebars but I
know I'm not riding a bike

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:13.073 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sitting with you whereas
in the lucid dream state it's

00:11:13.073 --> 00:11:16.676 align:middle line:84%
so realistic the brain thinks
you're actually cycling.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:17.978 align:middle line:90%
You know, lucid dreaming

00:11:17.978 --> 00:11:20.213 align:middle line:84%
about doing something isn't
just like visualizing it.

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:21.515 align:middle line:90%
It isn't like imagining it.

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.183 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
actually doing it

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:25.919 align:middle line:84%
because it's 100
percent visualization,

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:29.556 align:middle line:84%
so complete in fact that the
brain mistakes it for reality.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:30.757 align:middle line:90%
So it thinks you're doing this

00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:32.559 align:middle line:84%
so if you engage
a physical action

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.062 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream state the
motor cortex sends a

00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
command saying, you
know, move your legs.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.899 align:middle line:84%
Luckily you're paralyzed
during dream and sleep

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:40.067 align:middle line:90%
so your legs don't move.

00:11:40.067 --> 00:11:41.802 align:middle line:84%
The electrical impulses
still make it through

00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.737 align:middle line:90%
and leave that muscle memory.

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:45.439 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking
about, you know, cycling

00:11:45.439 --> 00:11:46.406 align:middle line:90%
and press-ups and stuff.

00:11:46.406 --> 00:11:47.741 align:middle line:84%
What the hell's the
point of that?

00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.943 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if we can practise
other things, our capacity

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:53.413 align:middle line:84%
for compassion, kindness, being
the person we know we could be

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
but have, are too scared to be.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.052 align:middle line:84%
Working on our meditation
training in our sleep,

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.288 align:middle line:84%
working on our spiritual
practice in our sleep,

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:02.823 align:middle line:84%
you know there are far
better things to be doing

00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:05.425 align:middle line:84%
than just press-ups but
the physical manifestation

00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:09.296 align:middle line:84%
of it is the easiest kind
of example to get people to.

00:12:09.296 --> 00:12:12.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You say that we
can work on our shadow?

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:14.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah,
so the shadow is.

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you define
it and how can we do that?

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, so the
shadow is a Jungian term,

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:21.575 align:middle line:84%
well Jung kind of pioneered the
term, used to describe the parts

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:25.178 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious that we've
denied, disowned or rejected.

00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:28.982 align:middle line:84%
So the shadow is the dark
side of the human psyche.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:31.218 align:middle line:84%
But dark doesn't
necessarily mean bad.

00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:32.319 align:middle line:90%
You know, for a lot of people,

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:34.287 align:middle line:84%
the shadow contains a
repressed sexuality,

00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
their oppressed anger, their
oppressed capacity for wrath

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.094 align:middle line:84%
and aggression and yet it
will also contain the elements

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:45.332 align:middle line:84%
that you feel you're not worthy
to accept within yourself.

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I'm a
little boy and I'm dancing

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.803 align:middle line:84%
around the bedroom, seven
years old and my dad walks in

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:50.837 align:middle line:90%
and says, oh, stop dancing.

00:12:50.837 --> 00:12:52.005 align:middle line:90%
You know, dancing is for girls.

00:12:52.005 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I will then repress
my inner dancer

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.942 align:middle line:90%
into the shadows of my mind.

00:12:55.942 --> 00:12:58.578 align:middle line:84%
So that will, so the shadow
will contain my inner dancer

00:12:58.578 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:90%
archetype as well.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.381 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just kind of
bad things in the shadow.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.049 align:middle line:84%
But for a lot of people
it is the dark side

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:04.217 align:middle line:90%
of the human psyche.

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:05.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: When you come,
become a hip-hop dancer?

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: You can't
become a hip-hop dancer.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.488 align:middle line:90%
You need to bring this out.

00:13:08.488 --> 00:13:11.791 align:middle line:84%
So in the lucid dream state
you can intentionally integrate

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.959 align:middle line:90%
shadow aspects.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.461 align:middle line:84%
Now of course the shadow
is being integrated,

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:15.996 align:middle line:90%
non-lucid dreaming as well

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:19.766 align:middle line:84%
as through Jungian
analytical psychology, therapy,

00:13:19.766 --> 00:13:21.134 align:middle line:90%
other forms of dream work.

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.837 align:middle line:84%
But in the lucid dream state
you can do it very directly.

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you can actually meet a
personified form of your shadow

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.642 align:middle line:84%
which is rare and
almost exclusive

00:13:28.642 --> 00:13:31.511 align:middle line:84%
to the lucid dream state, to
be able to actually converse

00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.447 align:middle line:84%
with your shadow not as
a concept but actually

00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.516 align:middle line:84%
as a seemingly physicalized
being.

00:13:36.516 --> 00:13:39.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Tell us about
your experience with a demon.

00:13:39.786 --> 00:13:41.288 align:middle line:90%
Facing a demon, my God.

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:45.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, so when I
first started lucid dreaming,

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:48.828 align:middle line:84%
teaching lucid dreaming I
had a lot, kind of repression

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.498 align:middle line:84%
around the things that I
should or shouldn't be doing

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.933 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream state.

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:56.136 align:middle line:84%
I kind of had this idea that
my Buddhist teacher was going

00:13:56.136 --> 00:13:58.738 align:middle line:84%
to look at my dream diary and if
I was having any lucid dreams

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:02.509 align:middle line:84%
about kind of sex or violence
that I'd get like chucked out

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't be
allowed to teach anymore.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:07.013 align:middle line:84%
So I started to become really
repressive with my dreaming

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.615 align:middle line:84%
and if I was having
a lucid dream,

00:14:08.615 --> 00:14:10.817 align:middle line:84%
like a sexy girl turned up, so
I was going no, push it away,

00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:12.719 align:middle line:84%
don't want any of that or
there was some violence.

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't want any of that.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.388 align:middle line:84%
I just want to sit and
meditate in a lucid dream.

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:16.723 align:middle line:90%
And when I was doing this I saw

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.192 align:middle line:84%
that these shadow aspects
became more and more powerful

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.795 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting these
kinds of shadow attacks,

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:23.163 align:middle line:84%
basically like nightmares.
You're in

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.232 align:middle line:84%
a lucid dream and these big
kind of demonic figures appear

00:14:25.232 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and I started fighting them.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.201 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's the
best thing to do.

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.669 align:middle line:90%
I should fight these things.

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.073 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my teacher
and he was like, no,

00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.374 align:middle line:90%
this could be a shadow element.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.076 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't fight it,
you should embrace it.

00:14:36.076 --> 00:14:41.147 align:middle line:84%
So these demons came up and
the kind of famous one, well,

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:44.751 align:middle line:84%
the one I talk about a lot
is when the demon appeared

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.121 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of three-headed
figure and I hugged it rather

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:49.189 align:middle line:90%
than running away from it.

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:50.857 align:middle line:84%
And when I hugged it,
it turned into me.

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:56.062 align:middle line:84%
And I was like hugging myself
and this version of myself kind

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.665 align:middle line:84%
of looked at me and just
went, and then I woke up.

00:14:58.665 --> 00:15:00.533 align:middle line:84%
And I never had any
more of those nightmares

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:02.035 align:middle line:90%
or shadow attacks again.

00:15:02.035 --> 00:15:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know whether
that was, you know,

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.906 align:middle line:84%
my directly hugging my shadow
but I talked to my teacher

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.241 align:middle line:90%
and he seemed to think it was.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But then he said, you
know, you're crazy,

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.245 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean literally
hug the thing.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.079 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.281 align:middle line:90%
You said, embrace the shadow.

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, embrace
the shadow means like,

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.152 align:middle line:84%
that you know, talk to it,
engage it, the seeing of the,

00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:20.754 align:middle line:90%
don't literally hug it.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:21.988 align:middle line:90%
But since then he said, no,

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:24.658 align:middle line:84%
do hug it because the
lucid dream state is unique

00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:27.327 align:middle line:84%
in that it allows you
to interact physically

00:15:27.327 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
with projections
of your own psyche.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.466 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the lucid dream
you can meet your inner child

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.201 align:middle line:84%
which will often
appear as someone

00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
who looked a bit
like you as a kid.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
meet your higher self.

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:42.909 align:middle line:84%
You can meet the whore, the
mother, the lovers, the fool,

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:46.546 align:middle line:84%
all of the deck of the tarot,
all of the tarot deck in you.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:48.682 align:middle line:84%
You know, these archetypes
reside within your psyche

00:15:48.682 --> 00:15:51.184 align:middle line:84%
and in the lucid dream state
you can meet them tangibly

00:15:51.184 --> 00:15:52.686 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:54.287 align:middle line:84%
You know this stuff
never gets old.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:57.157 align:middle line:84%
It's so fascinating and
it's so psychedelic.

00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:15:58.224 --> 00:15:58.992 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: I mean
anyone who's into kind

00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic experience,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.062 align:middle line:84%
you want a real psychedelic
experience,

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:90%
walk around your own psyche.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.333 align:middle line:84%
In a lucid dream, you
know, you're aware

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:07.233 align:middle line:90%
that everything is you.

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:08.968 align:middle line:90%
You go, wow, this chair is me.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.804 align:middle line:84%
This Lilou is a feminine
projection

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.539 align:middle line:90%
of my own psyche, wow.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:14.541 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly any boundaries
between us would break

00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.209 align:middle line:90%
down because I realize,

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:18.845 align:middle line:84%
oh you're not separate
from me, you are me.

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:20.547 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine if we could do
that in the waking state.

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:21.948 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we could
walk down the street

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.351 align:middle line:84%
and just take a moment to think,
these people weren't separate

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
from us, they're
projections of our own dream,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.123 align:middle line:90%
sharing the dream with us.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:31.324 align:middle line:90%
Think what we could do.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.626 align:middle line:84%
It would be so much harder
to be unkind to someone

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:35.261 align:middle line:84%
if you knew they
were part of you

00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:37.931 align:middle line:84%
and lucid dreaming allows you
to open up to that potential.

00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:41.067 align:middle line:84%
So in the waking state it
makes it easier to realize.

00:16:41.067 --> 00:16:44.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can we
say life is a dream?

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah,
we could say it.

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:49.709 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably an
overly simplistic thing to say

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:54.147 align:middle line:84%
but I think life is far
more like a shared dream

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:57.317 align:middle line:84%
than an inherently
existing reality

00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:58.717 align:middle line:90%
that we believe it to be.

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't think it's as
simple as, oh, it's all a dream

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely
dreamlike, definitely dreamlike.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.092 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the same ways,
if we can become lucid

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:09.029 align:middle line:84%
in our dreams, we can
so co-create and start

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.332 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the dream at will
within the confines of course

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
of the power of the unconscious.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So, too, in this waking state
can we start to manifest,

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.338 align:middle line:90%
can we start to wake up to life,

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:22.542 align:middle line:84%
can we start to create the
dream that we want to be dreamt.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We're going to
go into the practical side

00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.679 align:middle line:90%
and how we do that, but I hear,

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
what is your relationship
to alarm clock?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:32.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Pretty
good, definitely not.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:33.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Any others --

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Like, oh
God, get away from me

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:37.123 align:middle line:84%
but I do have a pretty
cool alarm clock you know.

00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:41.394 align:middle line:84%
I often say, who came up with
this concept of alarm clock?

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:43.963 align:middle line:84%
Who thought, okay, the best
way we can start the day is

00:17:43.963 --> 00:17:46.966 align:middle line:84%
in a state of alarm, you
know, adrenalin cortisol alarm,

00:17:46.966 --> 00:17:51.104 align:middle line:84%
the worst way to start our
day and yet most of us,

00:17:51.104 --> 00:17:53.106 align:middle line:90%
so ditch the alarm clock.

00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:56.443 align:middle line:84%
Get a soothing clock, you know,
that likes classical music,

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:59.312 align:middle line:84%
whatever you like, something
that kind of wakes you up slowly

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:01.214 align:middle line:84%
or one of those sunshine
alarm clocks.

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:04.017 align:middle line:84%
You know, it kind of
re-creates the dawn rising

00:18:04.017 --> 00:18:05.118 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You don't
want to brutally wake

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.354 align:middle line:90%
up from this lucid dreaming.

00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:10.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean do you have a sense
of the time that there is

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.392 align:middle line:84%
in reality, I mean
in this reality?

00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:14.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, so in a
lucid dream time is relative

00:18:14.394 --> 00:18:15.695 align:middle line:90%
to this reality.

00:18:15.695 --> 00:18:17.997 align:middle line:84%
So in a non-lucid dream
time is out the window.

00:18:17.997 --> 00:18:19.399 align:middle line:90%
You know, you can have a dream.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.634 align:middle line:84%
It seems like hours and it has
lasted 20 minutes or something.

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
In a lucid dream time
is relative to this.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.538 align:middle line:84%
So they've done this
with scientific studies

00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:26.806 align:middle line:90%
where they got people to go

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:29.109 align:middle line:84%
into lucid dream state and flick
their eyes, saying begin

00:18:29.109 --> 00:18:31.277 align:middle line:84%
and then they estimate
five minutes in time

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.147 align:middle line:84%
and flick their eyes again to
say I think it is five minutes.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:36.716 align:middle line:84%
They've shown it's roughly
the same as this state.

00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:39.519 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the conversation that
we've had now in, I don't know,

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.987 align:middle line:90%
ten minutes or something.

00:18:40.987 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what you could do in
ten minutes in your psyche.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.026 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what you could
explore inside your own mind

00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.963 align:middle line:84%
within even 30 seconds
let alone ten minutes.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:51.764 align:middle line:84%
And a lucid dream, you
could have lucid dreams

00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:54.167 align:middle line:84%
up to 90 minutes in
length which is kind of,

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:84%
once you're past kind of, eight,
nine hours in bed you're going

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.972 align:middle line:84%
to have very, very
long dream periods

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:03.142 align:middle line:84%
and those can be lucid
in the whole period.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.677 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So where
do you start from?

00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Does it start from
an intention or?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, intention
definitely the most

00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:09.983 align:middle line:90%
important thing.

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.552 align:middle line:84%
For the book I was
interviewing some Lamas and one

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.587 align:middle line:84%
of the Lamas I interviewed
was -- there's the book!

00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:16.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Beautiful
book by the way,

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:20.693 align:middle line:90%
my God, the cover is so great.

00:19:20.693 --> 00:19:22.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: I know we shouldn't
judge books by their covers

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.831 align:middle line:84%
but if you've got a really
badass cover I think it does

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:25.932 align:middle line:90%
help a little.

00:19:25.932 --> 00:19:26.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, your
friend did good work.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.034 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah, he did.

00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:31.104 align:middle line:84%
What were we talking
apart from badass covers?

00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:32.472 align:middle line:90%
Oh Lamas, okay.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:33.907 align:middle line:90%
The badass Lama.

00:19:33.907 --> 00:19:35.241 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: The intention.

00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:36.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: The intention yes,
the Lama Zangmo

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:39.612 align:middle line:84%
who is the female Lama who
runs the Buddhist center

00:19:39.612 --> 00:19:43.716 align:middle line:84%
where I live near London Bridge,
I was asking her about the kind

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:45.285 align:middle line:84%
of most important
aspect of Dream Yoga

00:19:45.285 --> 00:19:47.554 align:middle line:84%
and I thought she was going to
give me some sort of, you know,

00:19:47.554 --> 00:19:49.756 align:middle line:84%
secret Tibetan formula
to the lucid dream state.

00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:52.392 align:middle line:84%
And she thought about it
and she said, Charlie,

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
the most important thing
for Dream Yoga, and I said,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.395 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah, what is it?

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And she went you've got
to really want to do it.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.666 align:middle line:84%
You have to be fired
up and I was like,

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:01.334 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be fired up?

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:03.736 align:middle line:84%
You know, I won't find that in
the Tibetan text and she said,

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:05.638 align:middle line:90%
no, but this is the truth.

00:20:05.638 --> 00:20:07.674 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got
to really be fired up.

00:20:07.674 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
If you really believe that
lucid dreams are your birthright

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.845 align:middle line:84%
that you can do it, to remind
yourself that you did it

00:20:12.845 --> 00:20:14.614 align:middle line:84%
as a child, that the
children naturally do it.

00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:16.482 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that we
need to learn how to do it,

00:20:16.482 --> 00:20:18.418 align:middle line:84%
it's something we need
to remember how to do,

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:20.186 align:middle line:90%
that it is in our capacity.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:22.855 align:middle line:84%
You know the capacity of
the mind is that which knows

00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:24.958 align:middle line:84%
so in fact a lucid
dream is not weird.

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Non-lucid dreaming,
perhaps, is weird

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
because lucidity is a natural,
spontaneous arising of the mind.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.032 align:middle line:84%
So to remind yourself of this
be really geered up to do it,

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.667 align:middle line:90%
a really strong intention.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.302 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
most powerful technique.

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:38.037 align:middle line:84%
But then of course
there's all the other stuff

00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:39.973 align:middle line:84%
with dream diaries
and reality checks

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:42.208 align:middle line:84%
and falling asleep
consciously and self-hypnosis

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.377 align:middle line:90%
and all the techniques.

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:46.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah,
yeah because once you have

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:49.749 align:middle line:84%
that intention, I mean great
but then is it a matter

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:52.518 align:middle line:84%
of also setting one just before
sleeping and saying, hey,

00:20:52.518 --> 00:20:56.055 align:middle line:84%
you know, speaking to you,
yourself inside and saying,

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.257 align:middle line:84%
hey man, you know, I want
to wake up where I want

00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.792 align:middle line:90%
to be able to consciously dream.

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:01.261 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is a whole training.

00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It seems so far out
when we start.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah absolutely.

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:06.866 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because we feel we're
not in control of our dreams,

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:08.635 align:middle line:84%
like it kind of happens and
there's a period of time

00:21:08.635 --> 00:21:11.471 align:middle line:84%
where we dream more than
others but apart from that.

00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:12.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, most
people don't even remember

00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:13.539 align:middle line:90%
their dreams.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:14.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:16.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: You know, the
majority of people if you talk

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:17.644 align:middle line:84%
to them they say, you know,
I don't remember my dreams

00:21:17.644 --> 00:21:20.647 align:middle line:84%
or I don't dream and sometimes I
get complacent because I teach

00:21:20.647 --> 00:21:23.116 align:middle line:84%
within kind of Buddhist
circles and spiritual circles

00:21:23.116 --> 00:21:25.351 align:middle line:84%
and I start to just assume
everyone remembers their dreams

00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:26.853 align:middle line:90%
and everyone has a dream life.

00:21:26.853 --> 00:21:30.456 align:middle line:84%
And then when I do more kind
of public talks and I realize,

00:21:30.456 --> 00:21:31.524 align:middle line:90%
you know people don't.

00:21:31.524 --> 00:21:32.692 align:middle line:84%
People just don't
remember their dreams.

00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:35.028 align:middle line:84%
People tell me they
don't dream and I try

00:21:35.028 --> 00:21:37.063 align:middle line:84%
to explain scientifically
everybody dreams four

00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.766 align:middle line:84%
or five times a night,
blah, blah, blah.

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.134 align:middle line:90%
But there's a long way to go.

00:21:41.134 --> 00:21:43.369 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing is
recognizing that you dream.

00:21:43.369 --> 00:21:45.138 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is
setting your intention

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to remember your dreams because
unless you remember your dreams

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.809 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
have lucid dreams

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.745 align:middle line:84%
because a lucid dream
is based on.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:54.781 align:middle line:84%
You know, if we take this
from the dream diary thing,

00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:84%
the more conscious you are of
what you're dreaming about,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.184 align:middle line:90%
the more likely you are

00:21:58.184 --> 00:21:59.786 align:middle line:84%
to become conscious
within the dream.

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So the first
thing is to become conscious

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:04.457 align:middle line:84%
of what you're dreaming about,
so keeping a dream diary,

00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:06.759 align:middle line:84%
setting that intent,
writing down your dreams.

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:08.861 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll start to get
to know the territory.

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:10.563 align:middle line:84%
You know, get to know the
territory of the dream.

00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:12.065 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I always dream
about being in a forest.

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:13.399 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I always dream
on the planet Mars.

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I always dream about
this or that.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.269 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you're
on the planet Mars

00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:18.304 align:middle line:84%
in the dream I think oh,
I always dream about this.

00:22:18.304 --> 00:22:20.239 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and you become lucid.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.208 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get to know
the territory so well

00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:24.343 align:middle line:84%
that you'll know the
territory when you're in it.

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.447 align:middle line:84%
Now I could blindfold you and
take you into a bakery, right,

00:22:27.447 --> 00:22:29.449 align:middle line:84%
can't see the bakery but
I bet you could tell me,

00:22:29.449 --> 00:22:30.483 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm in a bakery.

00:22:30.483 --> 00:22:31.384 align:middle line:90%
You know the sounds.

00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:32.585 align:middle line:90%
You know the smell.

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:34.187 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the conversations.

00:22:34.187 --> 00:22:37.957 align:middle line:84%
So too with the dream, we need
to get to know the dream so well

00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:41.094 align:middle line:84%
that even if we're
blindfolded, as in non-lucidity,

00:22:41.094 --> 00:22:43.029 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to tell
when we're in the dream

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:45.565 align:middle line:84%
and that revelation is the
blindfold being revealed

00:22:45.565 --> 00:22:49.569 align:middle line:84%
and that experience from the
dream as real as this reality.

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:51.704 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Sometimes we remember
more in the morning, no?

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:55.541 align:middle line:84%
And is there a time during the
night or the day, the night

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:58.611 align:middle line:84%
or whenever we're asleep
that we can better remember?

00:22:58.611 --> 00:22:59.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, on
the retreats I run.

00:22:59.846 --> 00:23:01.481 align:middle line:84%
I run these like
four-day retreats

00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.083 align:middle line:84%
and on the retreats
we'll be sleeping

00:23:04.083 --> 00:23:07.987 align:middle line:84%
from about 10:30 till 3:00 in
the morning and then from 3,

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:10.323 align:middle line:84%
then I start waking everyone up
every 90 minutes.

00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:84%
So the first like, the first
three cycles, basically, first

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:15.294 align:middle line:84%
four and a half hours you're on
your bed and then I come

00:23:15.294 --> 00:23:17.296 align:middle line:84%
around with a gong and everyone
wishes they'd never met me.

00:23:17.296 --> 00:23:18.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There's
the alarm clock.

00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: And then if they
like they can then move

00:23:20.633 --> 00:23:23.703 align:middle line:84%
into the shrine room and we have
a sacred sleeping area set up.

00:23:23.703 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:84%
It's like another bed
but very just thin

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:27.006 align:middle line:90%
blanket and stuff like that.

00:23:27.006 --> 00:23:29.742 align:middle line:84%
So you make some divide
between the sleep of rest

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:31.711 align:middle line:84%
which is the first
three or four cycles

00:23:31.711 --> 00:23:33.646 align:middle line:84%
where you're getting your delta
wave, your deep sleep

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:35.248 align:middle line:84%
and the next few cycles
which is when you're doing

00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:36.482 align:middle line:90%
mainly dreaming.

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:38.818 align:middle line:84%
And in that case I'm waking
everyone in 90 minutes

00:23:38.818 --> 00:23:40.553 align:middle line:84%
so you're writing down
your dreams at 3 o'clock,

00:23:40.553 --> 00:23:43.389 align:middle line:84%
then again at 4:30, then
again at 6, you know.

00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:45.358 align:middle line:84%
So there are periods all through
the night you can remember

00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:46.726 align:middle line:90%
your dreams.

00:23:46.726 --> 00:23:49.162 align:middle line:84%
Most people however find in
the early morning it's easier

00:23:49.162 --> 00:23:50.329 align:middle line:90%
to remember their dreams,

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:52.465 align:middle line:84%
partly because they've
had six hours sleep.

00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:53.833 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I try
and remember my dreams

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.968 align:middle line:84%
after three hours sleep,
I've only three hours sleep.

00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:56.803 align:middle line:90%
I'm super tired.

00:23:56.803 --> 00:23:58.104 align:middle line:90%
My brain is not refreshed

00:23:58.104 --> 00:23:59.972 align:middle line:84%
but after six hours
my brain is refreshed.

00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:90%
I can remember.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.507 align:middle line:90%
I'm very clear.

00:24:01.507 --> 00:24:02.675 align:middle line:90%
I have clarity.

00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:05.244 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, dreams can be
recalled at any time.

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:07.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can you feel when
you're doing something like that

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:10.583 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, that
you're kind of changing

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:12.618 align:middle line:84%
or you feel a little
bit disrupted by it

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:15.054 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
changing the reality

00:24:15.054 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:84%
but you're wondering how
it's going to influence

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:22.261 align:middle line:84%
or even just kind of just,
am I making all this up?

00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:25.531 align:middle line:84%
Is that really going
to influence my life?

00:24:25.531 --> 00:24:27.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Not really, most
people find they sleep better

00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
when they start to lucid
dream, especially insomniacs.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.638 align:middle line:84%
You know insomniacs
love lucid dreaming

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:35.074 align:middle line:84%
because they've been told
that there's something wrong

00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:36.676 align:middle line:84%
with multiple wakeups
in the night.

00:24:36.676 --> 00:24:38.244 align:middle line:84%
They come to one of my retreats
and I'm saying you're going

00:24:38.244 --> 00:24:39.545 align:middle line:90%
to wake up four times a night.

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:41.314 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, I wake up
four times a night anyway.

00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:43.282 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like great,
you're there already.

00:24:43.282 --> 00:24:45.051 align:middle line:84%
You know because if you give
insomniacs something else

00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:48.354 align:middle line:84%
to do rather than lying in bed
and pathologizing the condition

00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:50.723 align:middle line:84%
of nighttime wakefulness
they can say, okay,

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:52.124 align:middle line:90%
well I'm awake in the night.

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:54.894 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a certain meditation
I can do to help me enter back

00:24:54.894 --> 00:24:56.295 align:middle line:84%
into the dream and have
a lucid dream state.

00:24:56.295 --> 00:24:57.563 align:middle line:90%
They love it.

00:24:57.563 --> 00:24:59.265 align:middle line:84%
And of course once they relax
they start just sleeping

00:24:59.265 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:90%
better anyway.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.769 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people find it
completely recalibrates their

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:04.904 align:middle line:90%
view of sleep.

00:25:04.904 --> 00:25:06.973 align:middle line:84%
You look at that third
of your life as 30 years

00:25:06.973 --> 00:25:09.909 align:middle line:84%
that you spend asleep not
as wasted time but as time

00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:12.411 align:middle line:84%
for exploration and
time for fun.

00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:13.546 align:middle line:90%
You end up getting to the point

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.615 align:middle line:84%
where you're excited
to go to sleep.

00:25:15.615 --> 00:25:16.749 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:25:16.749 --> 00:25:18.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: You're, oh,
when can I go to bed?

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:18.951 align:middle line:84%
When can I go to bed because
I want to do the lucid dream?

00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:19.719 align:middle line:90%
I want to remember my dreams.

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:20.453 align:middle line:90%
I want to write down this.

00:25:20.453 --> 00:25:21.587 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this.

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:23.456 align:middle line:84%
You know, it makes the
whole process exciting.

00:25:23.456 --> 00:25:25.591 align:middle line:84%
And why shouldn't
it be exciting?

00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:28.861 align:middle line:84%
You know, why should we
habitually give up 30 years

00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:30.897 align:middle line:90%
of our life to non-awareness?

00:25:30.897 --> 00:25:32.365 align:middle line:90%
You know we have this saying.

00:25:32.365 --> 00:25:33.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You sleep 30 years?

00:25:33.366 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah,
that's like my life plus

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:35.968 align:middle line:90%
like four months of something.

00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:37.336 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:39.405 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said my lifespan plus
a few months would be given

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:43.676 align:middle line:84%
up to non-awareness, to blackout
I'd ask for my money back.

00:25:43.676 --> 00:25:44.777 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, you know, no.

00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:46.679 align:middle line:84%
I've only like 100 years
max to do my thing.

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:47.914 align:middle line:90%
I miss 30 years on spending.

00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:49.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: My thing! I love it!

00:25:49.615 --> 00:25:51.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So suddenly
this allows you

00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to do your thing
in those 30 years.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.221 align:middle line:90%
Now of course sometimes we need

00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.622 align:middle line:84%
to blackout, you
know, deep sleep.

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:58.024 align:middle line:90%
We need to be blacked out.

00:25:58.024 --> 00:26:00.559 align:middle line:84%
But not all of sleep, we've got
at least a few hours every night

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.061 align:middle line:90%
where the brain is reactivated.

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not resting
in dreaming sleep.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.766 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not resting anyway
you might as well do something

00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:09.101 align:middle line:84%
with that non-rest
state, to lucid dreams

00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.938 align:middle line:84%
to explore the psyche, to
integrate the personality,

00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
to do your spiritual
practice in your sleep.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So when you
dream and you're aware

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:19.178 align:middle line:84%
of the dreaming that's when
you kind of wake up within

00:26:19.178 --> 00:26:22.181 align:middle line:84%
that dream and then you can
kind shift the scenario wherever

00:26:22.181 --> 00:26:23.516 align:middle line:90%
you want?

00:26:23.516 --> 00:26:25.318 align:middle line:84%
So how, how do you go and then
end up having sex or going

00:26:25.318 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
into compassion when it
started with a demon?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well --
work with the demon.

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
You know if you've got a
dream plan that, well as soon

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.196 align:middle line:84%
as you get lucid I want
to go surfing, let's say

00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:39.932 align:middle line:84%
but then you become
lucid, you're in a forest.

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:42.201 align:middle line:84%
I'd say don't change
the forest into a beach,

00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:45.171 align:middle line:84%
just drop the surfing, go
with the flow of the dream.

00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:47.073 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is why I
don't teach dream control.

00:26:47.073 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:90%
I teach dream choreography.

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
This is about directing the
dream, influencing the dream,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.778 align:middle line:90%
making friends with the dream.

00:26:52.778 --> 00:26:55.548 align:middle line:84%
And the same way the
choreographer may be presented

00:26:55.548 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:84%
with the dancers and the
music but then they say,

00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:00.252 align:middle line:84%
oh you're a choreographer, so
you write the dance routine?

00:27:00.252 --> 00:27:01.487 align:middle line:90%
So too with the lucid dream

00:27:01.487 --> 00:27:03.656 align:middle line:84%
so I say don't change
the music of the dream.

00:27:03.656 --> 00:27:05.124 align:middle line:90%
Don't change the dancers.

00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Work with what you've got
but make it your own dance

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.228 align:middle line:84%
and that's what lucid
dreaming is.

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like dancing
with the unconscious.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.498 align:middle line:84%
It's not about controlling
the dream,

00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:13.899 align:middle line:90%
it's about making friends.

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:15.668 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
control in the dreams

00:27:15.668 --> 00:27:17.570 align:middle line:84%
or you can make things
appear and disappear at will,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.573 align:middle line:84%
far better to make friends with
the unconscious than to try

00:27:20.573 --> 00:27:22.875 align:middle line:90%
and boss it about because it's

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:25.077 align:middle line:84%
so much more powerful
than us anyway.

00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:27.613 align:middle line:84%
You know people who think
they can control their dreams

00:27:27.613 --> 00:27:30.249 align:middle line:84%
are ascribing their sense
of I, their, me, my,

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:33.386 align:middle line:84%
I consciousness an inflated
degree of importance.

00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:35.488 align:middle line:84%
You know, that me, my, I,
that little top ten percent

00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:39.692 align:middle line:84%
of the iceberg as it were,
is paled in significance

00:27:39.692 --> 00:27:42.395 align:middle line:84%
to the awesome power
of the unconscious.

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:44.597 align:middle line:84%
You know it would be an
arrogant sailor who thinks

00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:45.998 align:middle line:90%
that they control the sea

00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:48.034 align:middle line:84%
and so too it's an
arrogant lucid dreamer

00:27:48.034 --> 00:27:49.568 align:middle line:84%
who thinks they control
the dream.

00:27:49.568 --> 00:27:50.736 align:middle line:90%
It's not about dream control.

00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:53.406 align:middle line:84%
It's about friendship
with the unconscious.

00:27:53.406 --> 00:27:54.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So how do you direct?

00:27:54.807 --> 00:27:57.343 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way to direct it
though in a certain direction

00:27:57.343 --> 00:27:58.778 align:middle line:84%
or have a certain
type of experience?

00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:02.681 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're a tennis
player or you are passionate

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.017 align:middle line:84%
about meditation and
compassion to the world.

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:06.685 align:middle line:90%
How do you go there?

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:09.088 align:middle line:84%
You find that you
automatically go there anyway?

00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:10.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Let's say this
tennis playing thing.

00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:11.757 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I want to
use my lucid dream

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:13.559 align:middle line:84%
to practise my tennis
serve or something.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Or yoga?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Now once I've set

00:28:15.528 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
that intention very
often you'll become lucid

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.499 align:middle line:84%
in a tennis environment because
the unconscious is listening,

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:21.634 align:middle line:84%
saying okay, you
want the tennis,

00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:22.902 align:middle line:90%
well I'll get it ready for you.

00:28:22.902 --> 00:28:24.904 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind of making
the scene while it waits

00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:26.238 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:28:26.238 --> 00:28:29.141 align:middle line:84%
But other times let's say
you become lucid in a forest.

00:28:29.141 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
You want to practise your
tennis serve and you don't want

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.179 align:middle line:84%
to do it what I do which
is say, go with the flow,

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:37.249 align:middle line:84%
then in that case you might want
to call out, tennis court now.

00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:39.385 align:middle line:84%
You know, words manifest
very promptly

00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:42.288 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream state
and this is so much fun.

00:28:42.288 --> 00:28:43.622 align:middle line:90%
So you enter the lucid dream,

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:45.224 align:middle line:84%
people say how do I
make things happen?

00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:46.592 align:middle line:90%
I say, ask for it to happen.

00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:49.628 align:middle line:84%
You're in your own mind so
simply make a suggestion.

00:28:49.628 --> 00:28:51.263 align:middle line:84%
Now of course you don't
have to call it out loud,

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:54.467 align:middle line:84%
just an intention in the lucid
dream creates a manifestation.

00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:56.735 align:middle line:84%
But to say it out loud it
does something very powerful

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:84%
because there's kind of
this voice energy there too.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:90%
But you can direct it.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.274 align:middle line:90%
You can choose what to do.

00:29:02.274 --> 00:29:04.477 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about
getting to know the dream.

00:29:04.477 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Like when I first started lucid
dreaming all I was worried

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.682 align:middle line:84%
about was staying in
the dream, you know,

00:29:09.682 --> 00:29:11.317 align:middle line:84%
and then eventually you
want to stabilize and go,

00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:13.385 align:middle line:84%
okay sexy girls now and
you kind of get a sexy girl

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:14.653 align:middle line:90%
to appear and stuff like that.

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:16.455 align:middle line:84%
The first few lucid dreams
you're just trying to stay

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:19.558 align:middle line:84%
in there because it can be
very unstable, the first ones.

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But once you've been in
there for, you know hundreds

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.429 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of times
you can get in there

00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:25.131 align:middle line:84%
and you can just start
to make things manifest,

00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:26.465 align:middle line:90%
just with your mind.

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can go fwoom and
you can just create a kind

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.669 align:middle line:84%
of a tennis court and you
can create the other player.

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:33.706 align:middle line:84%
It's like a virtual
reality simulator.

00:29:33.706 --> 00:29:34.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Self inception, ah?

00:29:34.907 --> 00:29:36.809 align:middle line:90%
I saw that word on your website.

00:29:36.809 --> 00:29:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, so
self-inception is

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
about using the lucid dream
state in a similar way

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.783 align:middle line:84%
that you'd use a
hypnotherapy session.

00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:46.352 align:middle line:84%
So it's going into the lucid
dream and calling out statements

00:29:46.352 --> 00:29:48.354 align:middle line:84%
of healing intent,
planting that seed.

00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:52.124 align:middle line:84%
So you know, you go in the lucid
dream state and like the smoker,

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:54.493 align:middle line:84%
Antonio did, went in the
lucid dream and he called out,

00:29:54.493 --> 00:29:56.896 align:middle line:84%
you know, I am free of the
addiction of cigarettes,

00:29:56.896 --> 00:29:59.732 align:middle line:84%
the addiction to nicotine
no longer serves me.

00:29:59.732 --> 00:30:01.467 align:middle line:84%
I am a non-smoker
now and forever.

00:30:01.467 --> 00:30:03.736 align:middle line:84%
Call out these statements
of healing intent

00:30:03.736 --> 00:30:06.405 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream and wakes
up and the addiction is gone.

00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:08.807 align:middle line:84%
It sounds too good
to be true but again,

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.743 align:middle line:84%
it's not because it's
quite difficult to get

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:12.344 align:middle line:84%
to that lucid dream
state in the first place.

00:30:12.344 --> 00:30:14.280 align:middle line:90%
It does take training.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, self-inception
would be the planting those

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:84%
seeds but basically that's
what happens during lucid

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:90%
dreaming anyway.

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:21.987 align:middle line:84%
You kind of plant the seed or
an intention right in there?

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:24.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well, not necessarily
if I was just like lucid

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:26.992 align:middle line:84%
and like flying about the place
what intention am I setting?

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just flying about.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.561 align:middle line:90%
I'm exploring.

00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:29.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Having fun, yeah.

00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:31.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, having
fun but once you go

00:30:31.363 --> 00:30:33.465 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream actually
call out to the space.

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:35.568 align:middle line:84%
So you don't talk
to the characters

00:30:35.568 --> 00:30:38.370 align:middle line:84%
if you're incepting an idea, you
actually call out to the space

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.539 align:middle line:84%
which is of course the
unconscious and you call it

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:43.375 align:middle line:84%
out with that deep conviction
you are planting a seed

00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:46.245 align:middle line:84%
in that super fertile ground
of the unconscious and that

00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:47.413 align:middle line:90%
that seed will sprout

00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:49.982 align:middle line:84%
into a manifestation
in the waking state.

00:30:49.982 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Have you had time

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.686 align:middle line:84%
because I know you're a Hay
House author so there's Anita

00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:56.655 align:middle line:84%
Morjani and so many people
that had near-death experience.

00:30:56.655 --> 00:31:00.359 align:middle line:84%
So you find similar
states sometimes?

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:03.262 align:middle line:84%
Can you get to those really
high vibrational places

00:31:03.262 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that people have
experience in NDEs?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah,
well I mean it was a,

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:10.836 align:middle line:84%
it was actually a near
death experience that kind

00:31:10.836 --> 00:31:13.672 align:middle line:84%
of brought me into --
brought me out of the sex

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:15.841 align:middle line:84%
and skateboarding phase
of lucid dreaming.

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:17.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love when say that.

00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:19.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Literally all I
spent, for the first like year

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.013 align:middle line:84%
or so, lucid dreaming
was sex and skateboarding

00:31:21.013 --> 00:31:22.781 align:middle line:90%
but I was 16, I apologize.

00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:26.919 align:middle line:84%
I was young and stupid,
now I'm just stupid.

00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:32.091 align:middle line:84%
So I had this big kind of
trauma basically when I was 17

00:31:32.091 --> 00:31:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and I had these post-traumatic
stress nightmares

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.429 align:middle line:84%
like four months after it and
they'd recur every single week.

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:39.365 align:middle line:84%
I'd have the same
nightmare to the point

00:31:39.365 --> 00:31:40.332 align:middle line:90%
where I was kind of waking.

00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to stay
awake all night

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.901 align:middle line:84%
so I wouldn't have
the nightmares

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
but of course it would
just come the next night.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.905 align:middle line:84%
So this was the time when I
would get into lucid dreaming

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.074 align:middle line:84%
as well and I'd read
in the book somewhere

00:31:49.074 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that you could use lucid
dreams to cure nightmares

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.846 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well look
I've had four months of this

00:31:53.846 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
and it's really getting me
down and I feel like my kind

00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.886 align:middle line:84%
of sanity is being kind
of questioned here.

00:32:00.886 --> 00:32:03.922 align:middle line:84%
So I managed to become lucid
in the recurring nightmare.

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:06.025 align:middle line:84%
I turned to face the
source of my fear.

00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:08.827 align:middle line:84%
It dissolved and the
nightmare went overnight.

00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that I realized,
okay, this is powerful stuff.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.033 align:middle line:84%
This is just the kind
of messing about.

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.269 align:middle line:84%
This is a very direct,
psychological intervention

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.738 align:middle line:84%
that we have access
to every single night.

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:23.909 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, that was
when I realized

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:25.444 align:middle line:90%
that I was holding a baby.

00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I was holding potential and if
I nurtured this thing it could

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:33.419 align:middle line:84%
grow to be this incredibly
powerful aspect of my life.

00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:36.121 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah for me, near death
experience was linked to my,

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:39.024 align:middle line:84%
sort of the kind of
genesis of my practice.

00:32:39.024 --> 00:32:42.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And Buddhism, since
in Buddhism the, do they believe

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in reincarnation, right?

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.834 align:middle line:84%
So is there a link with this
Dream Yoga, as they call it

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and what you call lucid
dreaming and the reincarnation

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.107 align:middle line:84%
and how you can make, even
recall or go into past lives?

00:32:55.107 --> 00:33:00.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, so the main,
the core benefit in fact

00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:02.915 align:middle line:84%
of lucid dreaming within
Tibetan Buddhism is preparation

00:33:02.915 --> 00:33:04.483 align:middle line:90%
for the death and dying state.

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So you know straight off the
bat this isn't about working

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.588 align:middle line:84%
with kind of self-hypnotic
ideas.

00:33:09.588 --> 00:33:10.889 align:middle line:90%
This isn't about exploration.

00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:12.524 align:middle line:84%
This definitely isn't about
sex and skateboarding.

00:33:12.524 --> 00:33:14.193 align:middle line:84%
This is about going
and then preparing

00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:16.128 align:middle line:84%
for the big sleep
at the end of life.

00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:19.398 align:middle line:84%
Because it is said that once you
die you don't just get reborn.

00:33:19.398 --> 00:33:21.333 align:middle line:84%
You aren't reincarnated
straight away.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:22.968 align:middle line:90%
You enter the bardo state.

00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:25.838 align:middle line:84%
Bardo is a Sanskrit word
that means place in between.

00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:90%
In fact this life is a bardo,

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:30.576 align:middle line:84%
its existence is a
succession of bardos.

00:33:30.576 --> 00:33:34.446 align:middle line:84%
But in this case the after-death
bardo is said to be a dreamlike,

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:36.882 align:middle line:84%
hallucinatory experience
that we enter

00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:39.051 align:middle line:84%
into once the mind
stream has separated

00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.653 align:middle line:84%
from the gross corporeal
body at the point of death.

00:33:41.653 --> 00:33:44.456 align:middle line:84%
So basically you die, your mind
stream separates from this thing

00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:48.026 align:middle line:84%
because this is dying and
enters into a bardo state

00:33:48.026 --> 00:33:49.361 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
bit like a dream.

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:51.764 align:middle line:84%
It's not a dream but it's
a little bit like it.

00:33:51.764 --> 00:33:54.466 align:middle line:84%
So it's said that if you can
train yourself to become lucid

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:56.201 align:middle line:84%
in the dream you're
training yourself

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:57.936 align:middle line:90%
to become lucid in the bardo.

00:33:57.936 --> 00:33:59.138 align:middle line:90%
So rather than go aha

00:33:59.138 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm dreaming, you might
go aha I'm dead.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.575 align:middle line:84%
Now why the hell would you
want to say, aha I'm dead?

00:34:03.575 --> 00:34:05.177 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
nightmare right?

00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:08.213 align:middle line:84%
But, apparently if you had that
realization of aha I'm dead,

00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:11.583 align:middle line:84%
full realization in the bardo
this contains the potential

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:13.919 align:middle line:84%
for full spiritual
enlightenment, you know,

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:17.890 align:middle line:84%
top deck stuff and highest,
highest potential is

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.591 align:middle line:84%
if you could become
lucid in the bardo.

00:34:19.591 --> 00:34:21.559 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
train in lucid dreaming,

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:22.928 align:middle line:90%
whether you know it or not,

00:34:22.928 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
you are training
your mind's capacity

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.532 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the bardo state.

00:34:26.532 --> 00:34:28.901 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
practice to do,

00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:32.271 align:middle line:84%
that means every time we do
this practice we're training

00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.472 align:middle line:90%
for that moment of death

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:38.844 align:middle line:84%
and every lucid dream we have
brings the fear of death,

00:34:38.844 --> 00:34:41.313 align:middle line:84%
actually not further
actually, closer towards us

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:42.481 align:middle line:90%
but in a fearless way.

00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:45.584 align:middle line:84%
We go towards that
fear and we say,

00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:48.153 align:middle line:84%
yeah death is coming
and I'm ready for it.

00:34:48.153 --> 00:34:50.622 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I could die
tomorrow so let's make sure

00:34:50.622 --> 00:34:53.325 align:middle line:84%
that tonight I practice for my
death so that I'm ready for it,

00:34:53.325 --> 00:34:56.428 align:middle line:84%
so that we can die with
a little bit less fear,

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:59.364 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more mindfulness,
a little bit more awareness

00:34:59.364 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to allow us to enter into that
state as we do in our dreams

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.670 align:middle line:84%
with compassion and
with lucidity.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:09.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What is the purpose
of Buddhism or how do Buddhists,

00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:84%
I know there's all kind of
different types of Buddhism

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:14.513 align:middle line:84%
so I don't know which
one exactly you practice

00:35:14.513 --> 00:35:18.117 align:middle line:84%
but what's the aim of it
all, really of life even?

00:35:18.117 --> 00:35:20.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well, I
practice Tibetan Buddhism

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:22.721 align:middle line:84%
and I teach lucid dreaming
with the Karma Kagyu lineage

00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of Tibetan Buddhism
and the Buddhist Center

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.859 align:middle line:84%
where I live is a Karma
Kagyu Buddhist Center.

00:35:26.859 --> 00:35:28.961 align:middle line:84%
But probably the
easiest way to answer

00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:31.029 align:middle line:84%
that question is a quote
from Buddha himself.

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:33.198 align:middle line:84%
When Buddha was asked,
you know, what's that?

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:34.433 align:middle line:90%
What's your teaching?

00:35:34.433 --> 00:35:37.469 align:middle line:84%
And he said, commit not one
unwholesome action,

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:40.539 align:middle line:84%
cultivate a wealth of
virtue and train the mind.

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:90%
This is the teachings of Buddha.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.476 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying, don't do
anything that hurts yourself

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:47.679 align:middle line:84%
or others, be kind to
people and train your mind.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:50.082 align:middle line:84%
And then apparently in a
kind of parable the guy said,

00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:90%
oh even that's too many words.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.052 align:middle line:84%
You know, sum it up, you know,
make it even more succinct.

00:35:54.052 --> 00:35:55.754 align:middle line:84%
And Buddha said,
train your mind.

00:35:55.754 --> 00:35:58.824 align:middle line:84%
You know Buddhism is a
series of practices engaging

00:35:58.824 --> 00:36:01.527 align:middle line:84%
in mind training, to train
the mind to be stronger

00:36:01.527 --> 00:36:05.497 align:middle line:84%
and more flexible and more
liable to recognize illusion

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
because the recognition of
illusion, the illusion of self

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.104 align:middle line:84%
and other, the illusion of
separateness is the foundation

00:36:12.104 --> 00:36:16.341 align:middle line:84%
of the mistake, you know,
of believing that I'm better

00:36:16.341 --> 00:36:18.443 align:middle line:84%
than you, you know, this
egocentric awareness

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:22.281 align:middle line:84%
that we step into is based on
a fundamental misunderstanding

00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:25.217 align:middle line:84%
that you're different from
me and in fact, you're not.

00:36:25.217 --> 00:36:30.789 align:middle line:84%
You're an expiration of
oneness is a natural arising

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:33.992 align:middle line:84%
or a natural endpoint
of mind training.

00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:36.395 align:middle line:84%
When we train the mind to a
point where it's so flexible

00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:39.698 align:middle line:84%
and so strong and so
compassionate that we see other

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.034 align:middle line:84%
as self and even get
to a point where we see

00:36:42.034 --> 00:36:44.603 align:middle line:90%
that self is illusion too.

00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:48.507 align:middle line:84%
But mind training, being kind
and not being mean to people.

00:36:48.507 --> 00:36:50.909 align:middle line:84%
If I was talking to a kid I'd
say, like that's what the,

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.145 align:middle line:84%
train your mind like it's
a, like you train your body.

00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:90%
You want to have a strong mind.

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:56.682 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be kind to
people and don't be mean.

00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:58.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, so you can go

00:36:58.016 --> 00:37:00.352 align:middle line:84%
with all those three I
guess in lucid dreaming.

00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:03.522 align:middle line:84%
I mean you have to like this
probably, this training.

00:37:03.522 --> 00:37:05.657 align:middle line:90%
This is really ying stuff!

00:37:05.657 --> 00:37:07.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, I
mean lucid dreaming is

00:37:07.192 --> 00:37:09.294 align:middle line:84%
about training the
mind most definitely.

00:37:09.294 --> 00:37:10.562 align:middle line:90%
It's also about, you know,

00:37:10.562 --> 00:37:13.732 align:middle line:84%
I talk about these three
foundations of lucid dreaming,

00:37:13.732 --> 00:37:16.001 align:middle line:84%
acceptance, friendliness
and kindness

00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:84%
which are actually three pillars
of kind of the spiritual path.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.073 align:middle line:84%
Often the way I look at it, you
know we have to have acceptance

00:37:21.073 --> 00:37:23.575 align:middle line:84%
that almost everything
in the lucid dream is us.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:25.877 align:middle line:84%
Ninety-nine percent of it
is a projection of our mind.

00:37:25.877 --> 00:37:27.846 align:middle line:90%
It's not some external demon.

00:37:27.846 --> 00:37:30.382 align:middle line:84%
It's not somebody like, you
know, hacking your mind,

00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:31.917 align:middle line:84%
all these kind of
dualistic notions we have.

00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:34.786 align:middle line:90%
It's us, however scary it seems.

00:37:34.786 --> 00:37:36.488 align:middle line:84%
You know and we go in the
lucid dream state we're going

00:37:36.488 --> 00:37:37.689 align:middle line:90%
to see ourselves warts and all.

00:37:37.689 --> 00:37:39.691 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see all
the stuff we've repressed

00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:41.793 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state we will
see in the lucid dream.

00:37:41.793 --> 00:37:44.096 align:middle line:84%
And for some people they
can't accept that so they set

00:37:44.096 --> 00:37:46.498 align:middle line:84%
up a dualism, oh a
demon came into my dream

00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:49.368 align:middle line:84%
or aliens abducted me in my
dreams and this kind of stuff

00:37:49.368 --> 00:37:53.105 align:middle line:84%
and you think, maybe but
maybe not, so acceptance

00:37:53.105 --> 00:37:55.073 align:middle line:84%
and then friendliness,
friendliness

00:37:55.073 --> 00:37:56.408 align:middle line:90%
to everything in the dream.

00:37:56.408 --> 00:37:58.844 align:middle line:84%
To know that if everything
is me then let me be friendly

00:37:58.844 --> 00:37:59.645 align:middle line:90%
towards everything.

00:37:59.645 --> 00:38:01.346 align:middle line:90%
Let me not reject the dream.

00:38:01.346 --> 00:38:04.983 align:middle line:84%
Let me not judge the dream as I
wouldn't reject or judge myself

00:38:04.983 --> 00:38:07.386 align:middle line:84%
or want to be rejected
or judged by another.

00:38:07.386 --> 00:38:10.422 align:middle line:84%
So we enter into the dream with
friendliness and with kindness.

00:38:10.422 --> 00:38:12.357 align:middle line:84%
You know once we know that
everything in the dream is us

00:38:12.357 --> 00:38:14.226 align:middle line:84%
so in some way at
least connected

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:17.362 align:middle line:84%
to our psychology why would
we be unkind to anything?

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:20.165 align:middle line:84%
You know, why would
anyone commit a violence

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:21.333 align:middle line:90%
in their lucid dream?

00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:22.467 align:middle line:84%
It would be like shooting
yourself in the foot

00:38:22.467 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or punching yourself in
the face, no it's you.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.505 align:middle line:84%
So be kind to everything
in the lucid dream,

00:38:26.505 --> 00:38:29.941 align:middle line:84%
be friendly to the dream and
accept that it's part of you.

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:33.278 align:middle line:84%
Now of course we can apply those
three pillars to this state.

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:36.882 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how much easier life
would be if we could accept

00:38:36.882 --> 00:38:38.984 align:middle line:84%
that the other was
just as important as us,

00:38:38.984 --> 00:38:41.887 align:middle line:84%
that we could be kind to the
other and we could be friendly.

00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:43.755 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can get to the
point where you want to be kind

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and friendly to chairs.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.326 align:middle line:84%
You know there's a bit
in the book where I talk

00:38:47.326 --> 00:38:49.628 align:middle line:84%
about in this lucid dream
I start hugging a chair

00:38:49.628 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:84%
because I realize that
God, if everything

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.632 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream is me then

00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:55.934 align:middle line:84%
so too the inanimate
objects are me.

00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So I start like hugging
a chair and thought, God,

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.371 align:middle line:90%
what if my Lama could see me now

00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
and think Charlie's
gone mad or something.

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:04.176 align:middle line:84%
But it was a realization,
the chair was as worthy

00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:06.478 align:middle line:84%
of compassion as the
other dream characters,

00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:09.081 align:middle line:84%
that that chair was
just as important as me

00:39:09.081 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%
because it was created by that
same mind, that same genesis

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.056 align:middle line:84%
that created the people in the
dream also created the chairs,

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:20.258 align:middle line:90%
and so too in this state.

00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:23.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you manifest
things, like if you want,

00:39:23.195 --> 00:39:26.732 align:middle line:84%
if you really want something
to happen in your life or?

00:39:26.732 --> 00:39:29.167 align:middle line:84%
Because you've achieved
quite a lot for now,

00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:34.039 align:middle line:84%
between the Tedx and
the book and the conferences,

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:34.906 align:middle line:90%
and the this and the that.

00:39:34.906 --> 00:39:36.608 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually
call some things

00:39:36.608 --> 00:39:38.744 align:middle line:84%
and bring some things
in your reality too?

00:39:38.744 --> 00:39:42.214 align:middle line:84%
How do you, how does
lucid dreaming help you

00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:43.715 align:middle line:90%
to manifest this?

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:46.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So at a very basic
level you can literally engage

00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:49.221 align:middle line:84%
the visualization or
manifestation in the dream.

00:39:49.221 --> 00:39:51.123 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I'm an
architect and I want

00:39:51.123 --> 00:39:52.958 align:middle line:84%
to see what my new
building will look like.

00:39:52.958 --> 00:39:54.526 align:middle line:84%
In the lucid dream
state you can call

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:56.128 align:middle line:90%
up a three-dimensional version

00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:58.597 align:middle line:84%
of your blueprint that you
can then walk around.

00:39:58.597 --> 00:40:00.899 align:middle line:84%
So the lucid dream is a
very basic state can be used

00:40:00.899 --> 00:40:03.935 align:middle line:84%
to manifest reality to
see how it will pan out.

00:40:03.935 --> 00:40:06.938 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to practise like
a rehearsal ground for reality.

00:40:06.938 --> 00:40:08.707 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're scared
of public speaking.

00:40:08.707 --> 00:40:11.343 align:middle line:84%
With the lucid dream state you
can go into the lucid dream

00:40:11.343 --> 00:40:13.345 align:middle line:84%
and practice your
public speaking

00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.681 align:middle line:84%
and maybe everyone will politely
clap or maybe they'll boo

00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and boo you and chuck
you off the stage but

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.686 align:middle line:84%
you know it's just mind, it's a
perfect place to rehearse.

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:24.356 align:middle line:84%
So in that way again we can
manifest what we want to see

00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:26.925 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state,
confidence in public speaking,

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:28.660 align:middle line:84%
by rehearsing in
the dream state.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.961 align:middle line:90%
But at the other end

00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:32.664 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum it
becomes more mystical.

00:40:32.664 --> 00:40:38.069 align:middle line:84%
It seems in the lucid dream
state we can plant very strong

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:41.907 align:middle line:84%
seeds of intention that
manifest far more powerfully

00:40:41.907 --> 00:40:43.141 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state
than if we were

00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:45.377 align:middle line:90%
to set those intentions now.

00:40:45.377 --> 00:40:47.045 align:middle line:84%
You know, right now this
is quite a gross state.

00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:48.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, this feels
pretty real.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.881 align:middle line:90%
You feel pretty separate.

00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:52.751 align:middle line:84%
You know I feel like me and
you feel like me in this state.

00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:55.687 align:middle line:84%
You do feel like me
because when I was talking

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:56.655 align:middle line:84%
about this, do you
feel like you?

00:40:56.655 --> 00:40:58.089 align:middle line:84%
I feel like me, blah,
blah, blah.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.992 align:middle line:84%
The lucid dream state,
it's much more flowing.

00:41:00.992 --> 00:41:02.093 align:middle line:84%
You know in the lucid
dream state

00:41:02.093 --> 00:41:03.895 align:middle line:84%
at least we know it
is projection whereas

00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:06.364 align:middle line:84%
in this state we kind
of think it's all real.

00:41:06.364 --> 00:41:10.101 align:middle line:84%
So because the lucid dream state
is in many ways a state closer

00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:12.604 align:middle line:84%
to an actual experience
of reality it becomes

00:41:12.604 --> 00:41:15.040 align:middle line:84%
like an echo chamber,
like one prayer said

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.209 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream seems
to be worth a thousand

00:41:17.209 --> 00:41:19.544 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state
because you're going kind

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:20.779 align:middle line:90%
of direct from the source.

00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:22.881 align:middle line:84%
You're going from pure
consciousness like direct

00:41:22.881 --> 00:41:25.417 align:middle line:84%
to the kind of source
consciousness.

00:41:25.417 --> 00:41:27.519 align:middle line:84%
And in Tibetan Buddhism
it's said that one moment

00:41:27.519 --> 00:41:28.753 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual practice

00:41:28.753 --> 00:41:31.623 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream state
is worth a one-week retreat

00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:33.024 align:middle line:90%
in the waking state.

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:37.329 align:middle line:84%
So if we apply those
same kinds of criteria

00:41:37.329 --> 00:41:40.098 align:middle line:84%
to manifestation we can see
just how powerful it is.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:41.233 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you go
into the lucid dream

00:41:41.233 --> 00:41:42.767 align:middle line:90%
and call out, I am loved.

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:43.602 align:middle line:90%
I am lovable.

00:41:43.602 --> 00:41:45.537 align:middle line:90%
I attract love into my life.

00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.639 align:middle line:84%
That's not just like
me saying it now.

00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.908 align:middle line:90%
That's like an echo chamber.

00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:52.777 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's like saying it
a 1,000 times, once you do it in

00:41:52.777 --> 00:41:55.447 align:middle line:84%
the lucid dream state, so it's a
very, very powerful place

00:41:55.447 --> 00:41:58.283 align:middle line:90%
for amplification of intent.

00:41:58.283 --> 00:42:01.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I had another
question regarding and zip,

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:90%
it went away.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.989 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:42:03.989 --> 00:42:07.392 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, I was so
excited about that question.

00:42:07.392 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:90%
It just went out.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.096 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:42:11.096 --> 00:42:14.766 align:middle line:84%
What are some other
aspects of lucid dreaming

00:42:14.766 --> 00:42:16.167 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't talked
about yet?

00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:18.103 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
come right back up.

00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: We can talk about
the spiritual practice thing.

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:25.277 align:middle line:84%
So, the lucid dream state is
a very powerful place to do

00:42:25.277 --> 00:42:27.379 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual practice.

00:42:27.379 --> 00:42:28.613 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I'm doing kind

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:30.982 align:middle line:84%
of a chakra meditation right
now in the waking state.

00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:33.251 align:middle line:84%
Now although the kind of new-age
scene like to tell us, oh,

00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:36.554 align:middle line:84%
chakras are in perfect
working order it isn't quite

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:37.956 align:middle line:90%
that simple.

00:42:37.956 --> 00:42:40.292 align:middle line:84%
Now often our chakras are often
literally spinning the wrong way

00:42:40.292 --> 00:42:41.993 align:middle line:84%
or they're kind of just
termed rusty chakras.

00:42:41.993 --> 00:42:44.496 align:middle line:84%
You know, our energy systems are
quite dis-aligned unless we're

00:42:44.496 --> 00:42:47.299 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of spiritual
practice so let's say I was

00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:50.735 align:middle line:84%
in a chakra practice in
this state things may not be

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:90%
in perfect alignment.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.538 align:middle line:90%
If I do a chakra meditation

00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:57.142 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream state, the
chakras are in perfect alignment

00:42:57.142 --> 00:42:59.144 align:middle line:90%
because I have no physical form.

00:42:59.144 --> 00:43:01.279 align:middle line:84%
In the dream state
I'm in my dream body.

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:05.617 align:middle line:84%
I'm in my subtle energetic form
so we reach our full potential.

00:43:05.617 --> 00:43:08.653 align:middle line:84%
You know in the lucid dream
state your chakras are perfect

00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:10.021 align:middle line:90%
so if you do chakra meditation

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:13.458 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream you can
reach far greater levels

00:43:13.458 --> 00:43:15.627 align:middle line:84%
of realization and
attainment than you could

00:43:15.627 --> 00:43:19.097 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state because this
gross corporeal body stops us

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:20.699 align:middle line:90%
doing stuff, like for one,

00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:22.334 align:middle line:84%
like you're trying
to sit in full lotus.

00:43:22.334 --> 00:43:24.102 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people unless
they're trained in yoga,

00:43:24.102 --> 00:43:25.637 align:middle line:84%
their knees will
start to hurt, right?

00:43:25.637 --> 00:43:28.573 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dream state there are no
knees so your knees won't hurt

00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:30.642 align:middle line:84%
so you can sit in
perfect posture for one,

00:43:30.642 --> 00:43:33.578 align:middle line:84%
your chakras aligned, your
energy systems are balanced

00:43:33.578 --> 00:43:35.747 align:middle line:84%
and for some people they
find, you know,

00:43:35.747 --> 00:43:37.615 align:middle line:84%
meditation in the lucid
dream state is one

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.951 align:middle line:84%
of the most mind blowing
experiences they can have.

00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.353 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the book
I talk about this.

00:43:41.353 --> 00:43:44.255 align:middle line:84%
When I first started I could
barely sustain meditation

00:43:44.255 --> 00:43:46.424 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream for more
than a few seconds and I felt

00:43:46.424 --> 00:43:50.562 align:middle line:84%
like my head had been put in
a microwave, and you just woke

00:43:50.562 --> 00:43:54.966 align:middle line:84%
up with just this huge shot
of absolute bliss that led you

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.935 align:middle line:90%
to wake up, so meditation

00:43:56.935 --> 00:44:00.038 align:middle line:84%
in the lucid dream state is
very, very powerful.

00:44:00.038 --> 00:44:02.374 align:middle line:84%
In fact one of the Buddhist
scholars, B. Alan Wallace used

00:44:02.374 --> 00:44:04.743 align:middle line:84%
to translate for the
Dalai Lama has said

00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:07.379 align:middle line:84%
that of the three main
states of awareness or states

00:44:07.379 --> 00:44:10.348 align:middle line:84%
of experience, sleep,
dream and waking,

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.985 align:middle line:84%
the one with the least potential
for spiritual realization is

00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:15.887 align:middle line:90%
in fact the waking state.

00:44:15.887 --> 00:44:18.957 align:middle line:84%
It is easier to reach your full
potential in the sleep and dream

00:44:18.957 --> 00:44:21.326 align:middle line:84%
than the waking state
because you're closer

00:44:21.326 --> 00:44:23.828 align:middle line:84%
to enlightened nature
in the lucid dream

00:44:23.828 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:84%
than you are in this
waking state.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.432 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And then you
can chat with Buddha?

00:44:27.432 --> 00:44:28.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:28.633 --> 00:44:31.436 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Are you, do you
do those conversations?

00:44:31.436 --> 00:44:32.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Well, let's
say I'm in a lucid dream

00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:33.872 align:middle line:90%
and I meet Buddha right?

00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:35.573 align:middle line:84%
I've got two options
working here.

00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:38.076 align:middle line:84%
One is you're meeting
a representation

00:44:38.076 --> 00:44:39.411 align:middle line:90%
of your own higher self.

00:44:39.411 --> 00:44:41.946 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my kind of inner
archetype of higher self,

00:44:41.946 --> 00:44:44.716 align:middle line:84%
the wise man for me, would
probably look like my guru,

00:44:44.716 --> 00:44:47.485 align:middle line:84%
Lama Yeshe Rinpoche because
he's my guru archetype.

00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:48.887 align:middle line:90%
If you were really

00:44:48.887 --> 00:44:50.989 align:middle line:84%
into Christianity let's say it
might look like the Virgin Mary

00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:52.991 align:middle line:90%
for you or Jesus Christ himself.

00:44:52.991 --> 00:44:55.627 align:middle line:84%
So we could be working just
with internal archetypes.

00:44:55.627 --> 00:44:58.296 align:middle line:84%
That's still a big deal, you
know, to meet your higher self.

00:44:58.296 --> 00:45:01.533 align:middle line:84%
In whatever form, it's still a
very, very powerful experience.

00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:03.468 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
other option which is

00:45:03.468 --> 00:45:06.604 align:middle line:84%
that the lucid dream state
is partially permeable,

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:09.274 align:middle line:84%
very difficult for anything to
get in without you letting it

00:45:09.274 --> 00:45:10.742 align:middle line:84%
but it is possible
for your consciousness

00:45:10.742 --> 00:45:13.978 align:middle line:84%
to expand beyond the boundaries
of the lucid dream state

00:45:13.978 --> 00:45:16.481 align:middle line:84%
and enterwhat we might call
the collective unconscious,

00:45:16.481 --> 00:45:17.849 align:middle line:90%
the universal mind-steam.

00:45:17.849 --> 00:45:21.219 align:middle line:84%
It could even be about kind
of astral plains and that sort

00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:23.721 align:middle line:84%
of stuff although I don't
usually use that terminology.

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So it could be in
the lucid dream.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:29.894 align:middle line:84%
There is the option to
engage aspects outside of you

00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:32.397 align:middle line:84%
and then you could be
looking at very powerful,

00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:35.867 align:middle line:84%
universal archetypes of
compassion such as Buddha mind.

00:45:35.867 --> 00:45:39.404 align:middle line:84%
Who's to tell the
difference, only the dreamer?

00:45:39.404 --> 00:45:41.272 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're the only one
in there, hello and people ask,

00:45:41.272 --> 00:45:43.441 align:middle line:84%
what do you think this
was in a lucid dream?

00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:45.643 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well I wasn't
there so I don't know

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
but I can give you hints on
what it might be but it's

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.981 align:middle line:90%
for the dreamer to decide.

00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:50.815 align:middle line:90%
You know, we.

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:51.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How did it felt too?

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:53.184 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's an important
question.

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:56.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, like I've had
enough dreams of my teacher

00:45:56.988 --> 00:45:59.023 align:middle line:84%
to know when it's just
a projection of him

00:45:59.023 --> 00:46:05.063 align:middle line:84%
and when it might actually be a
connection with him, you know,

00:46:05.063 --> 00:46:07.298 align:middle line:90%
as an actual energetic being.

00:46:07.298 --> 00:46:08.967 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeha, because often
we hear some teacher,

00:46:08.967 --> 00:46:11.102 align:middle line:84%
some spiritual teachers
here that say, oh, I'll come

00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:12.770 align:middle line:90%
and visit you during the sleep

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:15.373 align:middle line:84%
or you'll receive
emails, you know.

00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:17.108 align:middle line:84%
I receive sometimes
emails of people saying,

00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:18.510 align:middle line:90%
you were in my dream last night.

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.878 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:46:19.878 --> 00:46:21.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yes, I mean let's
say I have a lucid dream tonight

00:46:21.679 --> 00:46:22.881 align:middle line:84%
and you have a lucid
dream tonight

00:46:22.881 --> 00:46:24.115 align:middle line:90%
and we dream of each other.

00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:24.816 align:middle line:90%
Then I next send.

00:46:24.816 --> 00:46:25.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: My God, come on!

00:46:25.917 --> 00:46:27.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: You know,
but what does it mean?

00:46:27.519 --> 00:46:29.988 align:middle line:84%
It just means you had a lucid
dream and I had a lucid dream.

00:46:29.988 --> 00:46:30.922 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:46:30.922 --> 00:46:32.390 align:middle line:90%
It just means the projection.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.126 align:middle line:84%
However, if we were to do
that intentionally and I was

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:37.662 align:middle line:84%
to give you a password and you
could prove that password to me

00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:39.164 align:middle line:84%
in the waking state
then we could know

00:46:39.164 --> 00:46:40.365 align:middle line:90%
that there was a connection.

00:46:40.365 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
password experiments going

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.434 align:middle line:90%
on at the moment actually

00:46:43.434 --> 00:46:46.204 align:middle line:84%
on wakeupinyourdreams.com, a
website run by a friend of mine.

00:46:46.204 --> 00:46:48.306 align:middle line:84%
He's just started a
password experiment.

00:46:48.306 --> 00:46:50.842 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
it is possible.

00:46:50.842 --> 00:46:52.277 align:middle line:84%
You know, the people
who seem to be able

00:46:52.277 --> 00:46:55.046 align:middle line:84%
to enter your lucid dream
if you have the intention

00:46:55.046 --> 00:46:57.649 align:middle line:84%
to let them are kind
of dead relatives.

00:46:57.649 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
This one seems to come
up again and again.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It's strange because I don't
have any science for this.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.655 align:middle line:84%
Usually I try and make
sure everything is backed

00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.456 align:middle line:84%
up by science, no
science for this.

00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:06.691 align:middle line:90%
It would be only anecdote.

00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It seems if you have a very
strong heart connection

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.963 align:middle line:84%
or blood connection to somebody,
then when they're dead it seems

00:47:11.963 --> 00:47:14.465 align:middle line:84%
like the lucid dream state
can be a kind of a portal

00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:16.301 align:middle line:90%
for communication with them.

00:47:16.301 --> 00:47:17.702 align:middle line:84%
And the other people
who seem to be able

00:47:17.702 --> 00:47:19.070 align:middle line:84%
to enter the lucid
dream state are those

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:20.872 align:middle line:90%
who have woken up in this state.

00:47:20.872 --> 00:47:23.775 align:middle line:84%
You know if you've reached full
lucidity in this state it seems

00:47:23.775 --> 00:47:26.144 align:middle line:84%
to give you the ability to
enter other people's dreams,

00:47:26.144 --> 00:47:28.246 align:middle line:84%
so fully awakened
masters seem to be able

00:47:28.246 --> 00:47:29.814 align:middle line:90%
to enter their students' dreams.

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:31.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, I'm wondering
if after a certain time

00:47:31.983 --> 00:47:36.554 align:middle line:84%
and that was my question earlier
that I forgot but how does it?

00:47:36.554 --> 00:47:38.289 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's a better
moment to ask it now

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:41.893 align:middle line:84%
but how does it influence
you on a day to day life?

00:47:41.893 --> 00:47:44.262 align:middle line:84%
Can you actually
live in parallel,

00:47:44.262 --> 00:47:47.932 align:middle line:84%
kind of in a dream state
or imagine something else?

00:47:47.932 --> 00:47:51.302 align:middle line:84%
Like it probably gives you the
capacity to expand your vision

00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:53.304 align:middle line:84%
of this reality while
you're doing it

00:47:53.304 --> 00:47:56.407 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not saying lucid dreaming
while you're actually talking

00:47:56.407 --> 00:47:58.943 align:middle line:84%
to me right now but you
could kind of thing,

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:01.412 align:middle line:90%
to improve the experience?

00:48:01.412 --> 00:48:04.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah, lucid dreaming
definitely broadens your

00:48:04.115 --> 00:48:05.884 align:middle line:90%
perspective of reality.

00:48:05.884 --> 00:48:08.319 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make you
floaty and dreamy.

00:48:08.319 --> 00:48:10.188 align:middle line:84%
You know, a lot of people when
they meet me, I see this kind

00:48:10.188 --> 00:48:11.522 align:middle line:90%
of look of disappointment

00:48:11.522 --> 00:48:13.258 align:middle line:84%
when they thought the lucid
dreaming teacher was going

00:48:13.258 --> 00:48:15.393 align:middle line:84%
to be all like, wow,
crazy, hippie.

00:48:15.393 --> 00:48:16.628 align:middle line:90%
Where's reality?

00:48:16.628 --> 00:48:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Where's the dream, you
know, the opposite,

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.132 align:middle line:84%
every time you have a lucid
dream you're training yourself

00:48:21.132 --> 00:48:23.067 align:middle line:84%
to tell the difference,
to know the difference

00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:26.804 align:middle line:84%
between waking reality,
dream reality, illusion

00:48:26.804 --> 00:48:28.506 align:middle line:84%
and the other aspect
of illusion.

00:48:28.506 --> 00:48:30.541 align:middle line:84%
So actually lucid dreamers
are often very grounded

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:31.909 align:middle line:84%
and they're often
very pro-active.

00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:35.613 align:middle line:84%
Like if you spent your
nighttime hugging your demons,

00:48:35.613 --> 00:48:38.449 align:middle line:84%
walking through walls, flying
through the sky, the next day

00:48:38.449 --> 00:48:40.151 align:middle line:84%
at work when your boss
is giving you hell,

00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:42.153 align:middle line:84%
it's like water off a
duck's back, you know.

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:43.688 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to
work through this

00:48:43.688 --> 00:48:45.556 align:middle line:90%
because you feel so empowered.

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:48.726 align:middle line:84%
You feel so limitless in the
lucid dream and you can't forget

00:48:48.726 --> 00:48:52.530 align:middle line:84%
that so you bring that sense of
limitlessness into this state

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.533 align:middle line:84%
and realize that, yeah, although
I can't walk through that wall

00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:58.069 align:middle line:84%
in this state maybe I can
walk through the brick wall

00:48:58.069 --> 00:49:01.172 align:middle line:84%
of somebody's projections, or
even more importantly the brick

00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:03.308 align:middle line:84%
wall of my own projections
of my own baggage.

00:49:03.308 --> 00:49:06.377 align:middle line:84%
That it's not so solid that I
can pass through it and that

00:49:06.377 --> 00:49:08.746 align:middle line:84%
when I'm confronted by the
demons of my own arrogance

00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:11.382 align:middle line:84%
or my own fear so too
can I hug them just

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:13.685 align:middle line:90%
like I did in the lucid dream.

00:49:13.685 --> 00:49:16.821 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I wanted to finish
by this wonderful, you know,

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:19.657 align:middle line:84%
cover because, and I
know this is your friend

00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:22.427 align:middle line:84%
that did this cover and
obviously this was meaningful

00:49:22.427 --> 00:49:24.462 align:middle line:90%
to you to have a cool cover.

00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:28.099 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the significance
of the different elements there

00:49:28.099 --> 00:49:31.636 align:middle line:84%
so that we can maybe, you know,
end up on this to expand the.

00:49:31.636 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Morley: Yeah.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So to fully get it,

00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:35.039 align:middle line:84%
that maybe some aspects
are missing.

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:37.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So the cover was
designed by my friend, Fyb1,

00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:41.145 align:middle line:84%
who is an ex-graffiti artist
who's now gone straight

00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:44.182 align:middle line:84%
so don't worry, he's not an
illegal graffiti artist anymore.

00:49:44.182 --> 00:49:46.184 align:middle line:84%
But he's got the kind
of street-art vibe

00:49:46.184 --> 00:49:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and I actually sent him
a sketch of what I wanted

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.922 align:middle line:84%
and I kept the sketch
and it's so bad.

00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:53.858 align:middle line:84%
It's like this little stick
man Buddha with a brain,

00:49:53.858 --> 00:49:56.561 align:middle line:84%
all this kind of stuff but I
knew that I wanted every aspect

00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:57.962 align:middle line:90%
of the book to be represented.

00:49:57.962 --> 00:50:00.598 align:middle line:84%
So I got the brain to represent
all the neuroscience you find

00:50:00.598 --> 00:50:01.833 align:middle line:90%
in the book.

00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:03.668 align:middle line:84%
You've got this hand because
hands do strange things

00:50:03.668 --> 00:50:05.503 align:middle line:90%
in lucid dreams, reality checks.

00:50:05.503 --> 00:50:07.672 align:middle line:84%
You've got the dragonfly
which is the Toltec symbol

00:50:07.672 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:84%
of the gateway keeper
to the dream.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.508 align:middle line:90%
You've got the butterfly,

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:11.976 align:middle line:84%
of course the famous
Taoist parable,

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:13.311 align:middle line:84%
am I the man dreaming
a butterfly,

00:50:13.311 --> 00:50:14.812 align:middle line:90%
a butterfly dreaming a man.

00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:18.449 align:middle line:84%
You've got the lotus flower,
the symbol of no mud, no lotus,

00:50:18.449 --> 00:50:21.219 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we need the muddy
water for the beautiful lotus

00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:23.087 align:middle line:90%
to arise, just as in our dreams.

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:27.458 align:middle line:84%
And of course the A symbol
which is a Tibetan syllable

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:84%
which you often visualize in
the throat as you fall asleep

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:33.331 align:middle line:84%
to lead to lucid dreams and
it kind of looks pretty too.

00:50:33.331 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I was,
what's the hand stuff?

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.034 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:39.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So in the lucid
dream hands do strange things.

00:50:39.804 --> 00:50:41.639 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways, if you
think you're in a lucid dream

00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:44.475 align:middle line:84%
but you can't tell for
sure you look at your hand

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and you look away again.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.412 align:middle line:84%
You look back or you look at
your, flip it over a couple

00:50:47.412 --> 00:50:51.282 align:middle line:84%
of times and very often your
hand will blur or glitch

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:52.750 align:middle line:84%
or you'll get like an
extra finger coming out

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:53.818 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:50:53.818 --> 00:50:55.553 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with a kind
of a brain process

00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that finds it difficult to
replicate detail patterns.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.792 align:middle line:84%
So this is the easiest
detail pattern to look

00:51:00.792 --> 00:51:02.093 align:middle line:90%
at that's attached to your body.

00:51:02.093 --> 00:51:03.761 align:middle line:84%
So you look at the detailed
pattern, flip it over,

00:51:03.761 --> 00:51:06.531 align:middle line:84%
flip it back and often the
brain because it's not working

00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:10.635 align:middle line:84%
to full capacity will
create an imperfect pattern

00:51:10.635 --> 00:51:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
tell you're dreaming.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So it's kind
of like in "Inception",

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:17.475 align:middle line:84%
you might have really liked
that movie, didn't you?

00:51:17.475 --> 00:51:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Yeah,
yeah so when it came

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.912 align:middle line:84%
out I did a series
of talks on it.

00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:23.614 align:middle line:84%
Of course in "Inception" he has
so many lucid dreams he wakes

00:51:23.614 --> 00:51:26.017 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning, thinks
am I dreaming or not?

00:51:26.017 --> 00:51:28.386 align:middle line:84%
So he spins his little
spinning top and he thinks well

00:51:28.386 --> 00:51:31.222 align:middle line:84%
if it falls over that means I'm
awake because there's gravity

00:51:31.222 --> 00:51:34.459 align:middle line:84%
and if it keeps on spinning
then that means that I'm still

00:51:34.459 --> 00:51:35.960 align:middle line:90%
in the lucid dream state.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.529 align:middle line:84%
So this is like our totem, we
want to tell if we're dreaming

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:39.831 align:middle line:90%
or not, we look at our hand

00:51:39.831 --> 00:51:42.266 align:middle line:84%
and if the hand stays stable
then there's a good chance

00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.634 align:middle line:90%
that we are in fact awake.

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:47.338 align:middle line:84%
Of course the cool thing about
"Inception", spoiler alert,

00:51:47.338 --> 00:51:50.842 align:middle line:84%
is that the spinning
top is not his totem.

00:51:50.842 --> 00:51:52.977 align:middle line:84%
And I won't say what it is
but watch the movie again.

00:51:52.977 --> 00:51:53.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh my God.

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:55.446 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: So that's
a red herring.

00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:56.547 align:middle line:90%
That's not his totem.

00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:90%
His totem is something else.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you
for that, okay.

00:52:01.719 --> 00:52:03.254 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to check that out.

00:52:03.254 --> 00:52:06.657 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do our
little check/quest.

00:52:06.657 --> 00:52:10.528 align:middle line:84%
Anything else
that you would like to say

00:52:10.528 --> 00:52:12.530 align:middle line:84%
or to finish this
interview with?

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: No, just that if
people are more interested

00:52:14.532 --> 00:52:16.767 align:middle line:84%
in learning this stuff
then the book's out now

00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:18.703 align:middle line:84%
and it's got all
the things you need.

00:52:18.703 --> 00:52:20.638 align:middle line:84%
It's got a full toolbox of
techniques that teach you

00:52:20.638 --> 00:52:23.674 align:middle line:84%
to lucid dream and
there's on my website,

00:52:23.674 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
charliemorley.com is all
the list of workshops

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:27.411 align:middle line:84%
and retreats that I'm
doing next year too.

00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's about
practising that?

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.148 align:middle line:84%
>> Moreley: Yeah,
it's about doing it.

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:32.984 align:middle line:84%
I mean the book and the stuff
you can read on the website,

00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:35.286 align:middle line:84%
the stuff is good but it's
about bringing it into practice

00:52:35.286 --> 00:52:38.189 align:middle line:84%
and actually doing the sleepover
workshops and really kind

00:52:38.189 --> 00:52:40.191 align:middle line:90%
of making it part of your life.

00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:41.559 align:middle line:90%
>>Lilou: Awesome, thank you so

00:52:41.559 --> 00:52:42.593 align:middle line:84%
much for this delicious
interview.

00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:44.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Morley: Thank you,
it's been delicious.

00:52:44.729 --> 00:52:46.831 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Big, big kisses,
like you [inaudible].

00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:50.034 align:middle line:84%
Well, hope you have enjoyed this
conversation and if you want

00:52:50.034 --> 00:52:53.704 align:middle line:84%
to put comments underneath and,
you know, there's a whole forum

00:52:53.704 --> 00:52:57.408 align:middle line:84%
that you could go on and we'll
be really happy to read those

00:52:57.408 --> 00:52:58.743 align:middle line:90%
and to share those further.

00:52:58.743 --> 00:53:03.181 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, big, big
kisses from London, bye-bye.
