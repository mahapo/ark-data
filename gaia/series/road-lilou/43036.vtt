00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
beautiful co-creators.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here on the road in
London for a very last interview

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
while I'm here because I
mean London is, in Europe,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:84%
definitely one of
those places where

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:84%
you find very
interesting people.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And last time, I fell
in love with your story

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and your message.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
I wanted you back and do

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
this video, especially for Gaiam
because I think you're showing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
very much what it takes to
be a human being in this kind

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.164 align:middle line:90%
of messy world these days, huh?

00:00:45.164 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel like that?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does it
feel for you to be back

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
in London after spending
some time in Peru?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak
of shamanism here.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have a very
interesting perspective on it.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But how does it feel
to be back in London

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.672 align:middle line:90%
after this time in Peru?

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH SHAMAN: Well,
I've been back for 15 years,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
so it was a long time
ago that it happened.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
But it was difficult when I
did come back originally-- very

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.826 align:middle line:90%
difficult.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's because when
you're in the Amazon,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
you see how everything
is so interrelated and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.219 align:middle line:90%
interconnected.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no such place as
away, so there's nowhere

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to put your rubbish
for the start.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's nowhere
to go to the toilet,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:84%
so you have out into the
jungle and basically squat.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And we were quite lucky.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:84%
We had the luxury
of toilet paper,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
but that was also quite rare for
certain families who basically

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
just go and wash in the
river water or use leaves.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
we ate, we killed.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So all the meat that we
ate, we hunted and killed.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
All the fish that we ate,
we fished out of the river.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
All the water we drank
was from the river.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a real
symbiotic relationship

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
with the natural environment
and how humans lived in it.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was revolutionary
for someone who was born in

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
and brought up in London.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had an awareness of
it being human, but never

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:90%
an understanding of it.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And coming back to the West and
seeing just the amount of waste

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
that we create,
the amount of food

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
waste that we create,
the lack of connection

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
with the food that we're
eating-- including animals as

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Most certainly
animals-- we get it all

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
packaged up very nicely
in the supermarket.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't see all the guts,
and blood, and the gore.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.744 align:middle line:84%
And also killing an animal is
quite a traumatic experience

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
because animals don't
to die as much as humans

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:90%
don't want to die.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So there is a fight
there between the hunter

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.035 align:middle line:90%
and the animal.

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And the animal will try and stay
alive for as long as possible.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.551 align:middle line:84%
So you don't eat meat that
much just because it's

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
such a traumatic experience
to go and hunt meat.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.082 align:middle line:84%
And also, if everyone just
hunted meat every day,

00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:54.040 align:middle line:90%
the meat would run out.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a real
understanding that in order

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to hunt sustainably, you need
to hunt every now and then.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's special
guidelines as to who can hunt

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and when they can hunt.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And same with fishing--
so people would fish

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to consume with
their family, maybe

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
sell a little bit
here and there.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But most people would
fish for their own needs

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
and never over-fish.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And you come back to the West.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there is
none of that in place.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And I did have a panic attack.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was
Christmas I came back.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had a bit
of a panic attack

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
in Oxford Circus when I
saw these swarms of people.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought how
is this sustainable?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to sustain
this for the coming years?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And it really did freak me out.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
hardest thing really.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So you wrote the
Shaman's Last Apprentice.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're all about
this-- because I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
guess beyond the aspect
of fishing and hunting,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
there was to whole
shift in your way

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of being and
connecting to the earth

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and relating to the planet
and to other human beings.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you really bring.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about this
core, this message,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.597 align:middle line:84%
or how now you're relating
to yourself or others.

00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Well, what I
realized that while I was

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
in the Amazon is
that we're all human.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And we're all interconnected.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.418 align:middle line:84%
We're a race of humanity
just like-- we're

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:90%
another species on this planet.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We're not separated
from the planet.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
We're not individualistic.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We're actually a collective
working on this planet.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are all experiencing
life in the same way.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
We might have different
stories, different characters,

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
different situations
happening to us.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.854 align:middle line:84%
But the basic experience
of life is equal

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
for everyone and
everyone is being

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
faced with the same issues, same
challenges, the same blessings.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've kind of over the
last few centuries really

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
created a system
and a belief system

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that's very much
individualistic.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.367 align:middle line:84%
It's me against the world, and
I need to get my needs met.

00:04:58.367 --> 00:05:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to get
my needs met regardless

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
of how it's affecting
the whole, regardless

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
of how it's affecting
the environment.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And certainly over the
last 40 or 50 years,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
we've seen that
massively progress

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:90%
in our economic systems.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that
we've forgotten.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We've just forgotten this
understanding, this wisdom

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.445 align:middle line:84%
that actually we're
all in this together.

00:05:22.445 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:90%
We're a global family.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And we need to unite and
start working together

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.924 align:middle line:84%
to combat some of the
challenges that we're

00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
going to be facing
because of the system

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.506 align:middle line:90%
that we have in place.

00:05:31.506 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not people,
it's the system that

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:84%
is feeding the people,
that is feeding us.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
If we change the system,
people would be different.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a belief
system, and we need

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
to change our
belief system first.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's all down
to what we value.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And we need to move away from
a very selfish me, me, me

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
value system to a much more
inclusive value system where

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.569 align:middle line:84%
there's everything
for everybody.

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
There's enough for
everybody on the planet.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can live a
healthy, prosperous life.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we need to
really, every one of us,

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
start believing that and
start living in that way.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.109 align:middle line:90%
It's our actions.

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.191 align:middle line:84%
It's our belief system
that needs to change first,

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and then our actions
come after that.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like what
Gandhi said, if you

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
want to see change in the
world, you have to be it.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to be the change.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.927 align:middle line:84%
And what he meant by
that is that we all

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
need to change a little
bit within ourselves

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.682 align:middle line:84%
in order for the
collective to change.

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.390 align:middle line:84%
It's never going to
come from the system.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We cannot change what's
happening externally.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.590 align:middle line:84%
We can only change what's
happening within ourselves.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And once we change that, then we
can really change the external.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.389 align:middle line:84%
And my time in the Amazon--
and also my time in Machu

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Picchu because I lived in
Machu Picchu for seven months

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:90%
before I went to the Amazon.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And that also had
a profound effect

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
on me living in the
Andes Mountains,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
living with local community, and
seeing the entrepreneurships,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the natural social cohesion, the
understanding that everyone was

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
reliant on the natural
resources of that place,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.802 align:middle line:84%
and actually being there
in time of a big shift when

00:07:05.802 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
corporations were starting
to realize there was

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
a big profit making
possibility for Machu Picchu.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing that, actually,
local community has the power,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
but we give our power away
because we're not united.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We're individual
voices, but we need

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to become more united in
order to have the full voice,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:90%
in order to have the power.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can see very
clearly that over the years

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the unions-- certainly in
England, in this country--

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
have been demoralized
and almost broken down

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
because when people come
together in force and demand

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.764 align:middle line:84%
something, they have
a lot more clout.

00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
If you've got people
individually trying

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to fight their little
corner, it just

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:90%
takes a much longer process.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.302 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
that much power.

00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is it something
that the shaman understands

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
because you've been spending
some time with a shaman?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that he
very much feels or act on?

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.059 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Well, this is
because I'm a Westerner.

00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm born in the West.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is my perspective on it.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
A shaman-- my teacher,
Don Juanito, was very old.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 80's.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
He lived in a village
far away from Iquitos,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
which is the main Amazonian
city of the upper basin of Peru.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he just served his local
community as a querendaro.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what they called
him, a querendaro.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It means someone who heals
people, that cures people using

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:90%
the medicine plant Ayahuasca.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
And people would
come to him, and he

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:90%
would serve the medicine.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:90%
And he was also a great healer.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
He was also known
as a great healer.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
No one died in his
house, which is

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
a sign of someone
that has power.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And people-- that's
how they gauge it.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually, people who-- if
someone dies in your house,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.594 align:middle line:84%
it means that you actually, as
a shaman, it's kind of almost

00:08:54.594 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:90%
like the end of your career.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But he was trained
with the Bora Bora.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It was him.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:90%
It was who he was.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't live in
the West, so his context

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:90%
was very much Amazonian based.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It was very much natural based.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And for me, I had to come back.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken so
many years to try

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and fit in what I learned
from that Amazonian context

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and put it into
a western context

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
without getting
absolutely desperate

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and just going back to Peru
and living in the Amazon, which

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:90%
is really what I wanted to do.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:28.582 align:middle line:84%
But it was very clear
that, actually--

00:09:28.582 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and the shaman also, he
was very clear with me.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, your purpose is
to take these messages

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
and bring them back to the West.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't really
understand what that meant.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And so it took a
while to understand

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
that it had to come from
within me, the change.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.830 align:middle line:90%
And I did try.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I went to work in
the corporate world.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I went to work with big
businesses in travel

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and tourism-- CEOs
and presidents

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
of 100 of the major travel
and tourism companies

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
as a sustainable development and
corporate social responsibility

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
manager.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I worked for a lobby group
that lobbied governments

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.130 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of our members.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was a futile
experience really

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because even though you had
some CEOs and presidents that

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.010 align:middle line:84%
were really keen on the green
agenda and really wanted it,

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
the system itself
wouldn't let them.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have the
system-- and everyone knows

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:84%
this profit orientated
system-- and you

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.352 align:middle line:84%
have to cut your profit to help
environmentally and socially.

00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You're just not
going to-- you just

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
don't have the inspiration
or even the push to do it.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So you don't because you
have to maximize profit.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I saw very
clearly that it

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
is the system itself is
you can't ever change that.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.445 align:middle line:84%
It's really that
we have to start

00:10:45.445 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
changing our belief system.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's the
people in the companies

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:90%
that have the most power.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
If the people in the companies
started uniting themselves

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
within that company and
changing things from the bottom

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.509 align:middle line:84%
up rather than the top down,
things would change, I think,

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:90%
much quicker.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot more
power in middle management.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And if they came together
as one voice rather than it

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
coming down from the
top-- and the top

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
are bound by the
system's limitations.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: The shaman
contacts, also,

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
the spirit world or is
in contact with not only

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the plants and their
wisdom, but also--

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
so he's very much
connected, right?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is one of,
I guess, of the things

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
bring us, too, is

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.967 align:middle line:84%
to feel this connection among
one another and to our planet.

00:11:33.967 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Absolutely, I
mean when you drink Ayahuasca,

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
when you work in the Amazon,
there's spirits all around.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just see
the different spirits.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
What you actually do is realize
that we are very limited,

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and certainly here in
this part of the world,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
by our three
dimensional reality.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And our three
dimensional reality

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
is very limited to
our five senses.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
out into the Amazon

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.945 align:middle line:84%
and you start
drinking Ayahuasca,

00:11:58.945 --> 00:12:02.552 align:middle line:84%
you realize that we're living
in a multi-dimensional reality,

00:12:02.552 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
absolutely multi-dimensional.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on where you
have your dial channeled to.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And most people have
their dial, if you

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:84%
imagine a radio
frequency, channeled

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
onto a three
dimensional frequency.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
you're seeing.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you allow yourself
to change it and open it up,

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you can move it to the fourth
and fifth dimensional realities

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and actually start
seeing how there's

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.677 align:middle line:84%
so much multi-level
things happening,

00:12:28.677 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:90%
even if we can't see them.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And I always use the
analogy of elephants

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
because I never
thought elephants

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
were communicating
with each other.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they
devised a sound box.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was created
with this frequency

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.477 align:middle line:84%
much lower than what
humans can hear.

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that
elephants were, of course,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
communicating with each
other, but we can't hear them.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Just like we can't here a
dog whistle because we're not

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:90%
tuned for the dog whistle.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.270 align:middle line:84%
If we allowed ourselves to
be more tuned up to a greater

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:84%
reality, we'd actually
see how we are also

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.926 align:middle line:90%
collectively connected.

00:13:03.926 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is
also that we're

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
needing to remember this
wisdom because we're

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
reaching a point of
crisis on the planet.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.995 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
mutually exclusive,

00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like it's
happening because we're

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:90%
in this crisis on the planet.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And people are having to
wake up and realize this.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
that we're needing,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
all the wisdom is available
to us on our fingertips.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The web, the internet
is our nervous system.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can type in anything
that we want to search,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:90%
and things will come up.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
My friend wanted to find a
ceremony online, a Dionysus

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.312 align:middle line:90%
Ceremony.

00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know a
hundred years ago,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to join
a mystical school.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to train
for years and years.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:84%
You'd have to done this
right, and that ritual,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:90%
and probably fasted.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.986 align:middle line:84%
And she Googled it and found
it in three minutes-- amazing.

00:13:52.986 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But I really think that
that's because now we

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.039 align:middle line:84%
don't have the time
for all of that.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It's all at our fingertips if
we're willing to open our eyes,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and actually start
investigating, and seeing

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.316 align:middle line:90%
what's really out there.

00:14:03.316 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But the information
is out there.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It's up to people to be
willing to actually find

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
that-- go on that
journey themselves.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: How can we find it
without the Ayahuasca trip?

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:90%
How can we see that?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.810 align:middle line:84%
How can we be in contact with
that on a day to day basis

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
even in cities like London?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Well, meditation
is definitely a very good way

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of going into the silence within
yourself and actually realizing

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that the whole
universe is within you.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I've been meditating
for 20 years.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I do Vipassana meditation.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.255 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel that
that's a very important part

00:14:38.255 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
of anyone's conscious
development.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Without meditation if
you don't still the mind,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.747 align:middle line:84%
then you cannot go
any further deeper in.

00:14:47.747 --> 00:14:49.455 align:middle line:84%
So stilling the mind
is really important.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
There's all sorts of
other ways of going.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just exercising--
I mean, if you go for a run,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.615 align:middle line:84%
and you get into the zone, and
if you're not having music on,

00:15:00.615 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:84%
but you're just
really connecting

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
in with the pounding of
the feet and the connecting

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:90%
of the nature around you.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
running outside.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:90%
In a gym, it's much harder.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you go out
and run outside,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and you take your music
off, and you start really

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:84%
connecting in with the nature
and the natural rhythms,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:90%
you can find a natural flow.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into your
zone, loads of things

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:90%
can come up from within.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like you
get out of the natural state

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and you put yourself
into a trance state.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Trance stating is a
really powerful way

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:84%
of connecting much
more deeper within.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
To see spirits-- I
mean, you wouldn't

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
want to necessarily
see spirits unless you

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:84%
were in a very
contained environment.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they are all around us.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
But it can be very disturbing.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.637 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Why is
that disturbing?

00:15:43.637 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: To see
spirits around us--

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
because, especially in
a big place like London,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:84%
you don't have the freedom
to-- it's very restricted here

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:90%
anyway and very crazy.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So the vibration's
too frenetic really

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get
to that state where

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
you're in that state
to be able to see them.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
In the Amazon, obviously,
it's really slow.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The way you live out there
is really, really slow.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
It's really calm.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you drink
the Ayahuasca,

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:90%
obviously, the spirits come.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.572 align:middle line:84%
And then once you see
them, you've seen them.

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a door's open just

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.196 align:middle line:84%
like if you start riding a
bicycle you never forget.

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Likewise once it
opens, it opens.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But coming to the
West, I don't see them.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I see them only when I--
I don't see them anymore.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
protection really.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a protection.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.123 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, you have
to be ready to be --

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:35.699 align:middle line:84%
want to see them just because
it can be so disconcerting

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
because you still having
to function in the three

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:90%
dimensional reality.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Even if we can see
other levels, we're

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:84%
still living on a three
dimensional reality.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.639 align:middle line:84%
So we always are having to
relate to this way of living.

00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: So why are they here?

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
What is their
messages additionally

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
to the ones you've just said?

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Why are they around us?

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Well, spirits--
well, in the Amazon,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.329 align:middle line:84%
it's usually spirits of
children, actually, that come.

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're curious to
see what's going on.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.278 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have
that much experience

00:17:12.278 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
with spirits in the West.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
So I wouldn't be in a position.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Probably a medium who
contacts spirits directly

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
would be in a better position
to answer that question.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I like to-- I'm quite
a practical person,

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.630 align:middle line:84%
so for me, I don't
see necessarily

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
how spirits are going
to necessarily help me

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:90%
in my daily life.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.826 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really spend
that much time focusing.

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't spend any
time focusing on what

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't see right
in the immediate

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because what we're
needing to do in the West

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
is actually deal
with reality as it is

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and not as we would
like it to be.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And you can get caught up.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:59.037 align:middle line:84%
And I see it a lot of people
with channeling and looking

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
beyond themselves for
the answers and stuff.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But my feeling is that we
have it within ourselves.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
That we're all really
powerful beings.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
We just have to go and decide
that we want to do the work,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and walk on the path, and find
these answers within ourselves.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Relying too much
on things that we

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.984 align:middle line:84%
can't see that
aren't tangible, you

00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
is coming in then.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So my feeling is that
is to go and find out

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
from your own inner
wisdom, and do

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
your own journey
of self discovery.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.352 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's the
most joyous way of doing

00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:84%
because then you're not
getting caught up in anything

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you don't know or
don't understand.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And not too
much in imagination,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but really working as a
spiritual activist as we were

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
saying with-- because you
are a spiritual activist.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, coming out
of that now, you

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
want to infiltrate
those companies

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and bring in the
new message, right?

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty pragmatic.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.895 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Yeah, I definitely
wouldn't call myself

00:18:55.895 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual activist though.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I am just a human being
on the planet that

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
is finding way-- I have found
a way of really enjoying

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:90%
myself and having a great time.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And I come from a background of
depression, stress, anxiety--

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, I tried to commit
suicide when I was 13.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:90%
I had a near death experience.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So I've been there
to that point of stop

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.281 align:middle line:90%
the planet I want to get off.

00:19:24.281 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
on the planet anymore.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like what was going on.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey
of self discovery.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've come through
it and realized

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that I had to change the
way that I saw the world.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I had to change the way
that I saw other people.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.015 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
I had to change the way

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:90%
that I saw myself.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I was terrible to myself.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I was my worst enemy.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:90%
I would put myself down.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
I never gave myself some
time to just enjoy myself.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And the journey of self
discovery and going

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
into the Amazon actually
took away all those layers

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of delusion to the point when I
realized, oh, actually I'm OK.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually OK.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And not only am I OK, but I'm
actually quite a nice person.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.581 align:middle line:84%
And not only am I
kind of a nice person,

00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
but I really actually enjoy
being here because I enjoy

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
interrelating and
connecting with people.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it came from that
journey to come to this point.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And I always say to
people, it's all about

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:90%
having fun on the planet.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having
fun on the planet,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.689 align:middle line:84%
if you're not really enjoying
your life, if you're not

00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:27.472 align:middle line:84%
getting all the best out of your
life, then it's not in balance.

00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:90%
And something is wrong.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.734 align:middle line:84%
And it's then
realizing that there's

00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
something that's
not quite right--

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.805 align:middle line:84%
that some needs within
you aren't being met.

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you have to go
out, and find the needs that

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
aren't being met, and
start meeting them

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
it's all about.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter what you do.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a janitor
in a school, whether you're

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
a cleaner on the streets,
or whether you're

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
a top banker-- actually,
it doesn't matter.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.519 align:middle line:90%
It's, are you happy?

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the question people
should be asking themselves.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Am I happy?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Not have I got millions of
pounds in the bank account

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because I'll tell
you, lots of people

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
have got millions of
pounds in the bank,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and they're just not happy.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean the lottery
curse is all around us.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
People who suddenly win
loads of money, and it just

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.037 align:middle line:84%
destroys their lives
because money can never

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:12.870 align:middle line:90%
bring you happiness.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Happiness comes from
a place within when

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
your emotional needs are met.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're now realizing that
in the West because most of us

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.127 align:middle line:90%
have all our physical needs met.

00:21:21.127 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:90%
And we're still not happy.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take
that step further.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I'm more of a
consciousness advocate saying,

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you know if you want
to find that balance,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
find that harmony,
find that peace,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
then you have to go on a
journey of self discovery.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are people like
me that have done that.

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can show the way and
show you which way to go.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.827 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take
that journey yourself.

00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:90%
No one can take you to it.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:90%
The time of the guru is over.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:84%
We all have to take
personal responsibility.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Forget gurus-- that
was so 19th century.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:90%
We're in 21st century now.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to
be their own guru.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to be
their own teacher.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's people
who are holding up

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:90%
sign posts to show you the way.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, you
have to be that change.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.690 align:middle line:84%
No point in reading
books, and reading books,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and reading books, and
reading books, and going,

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could be
more like that or I

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.001 align:middle line:90%
wish I could be more like that.

00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%
You just got to get up
and start being that.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.012 align:middle line:90%
And that's the next step.

00:22:22.012 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
That's what I feel is the
next step in consciousness.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.095 align:middle line:84%
And that's the difference
between really that

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
because spirituality

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:90%
is a lifestyle choice.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is when
you start being it.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
difference because you

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.850 align:middle line:84%
can have a lifestyle choice
but still not be conscious

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and still not being it.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
You can be doing it
but still in your mind

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:90%
and still not fully being it.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And there is a big difference.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this is really
about being who you really

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
are, being who you really are,
standing up and saying, I'm OK.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I'm OK.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.175 align:middle line:90%
And that's very hard nowadays.

00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We're all finding
it's very hard to do.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Last time I remember
we spoke of something like

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
being a shaman or living
a shamanic way of life.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you recommend?

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Living
shamanically is taking personal

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for the choices
that you've made in your life

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.815 align:middle line:84%
for where you are now because
you can't dwell in the back,

00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%
The past is gone.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- in the back,
in the back end of the life,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.719 align:middle line:90%
the past life.

00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to go from
where you are now

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and where you want to forward.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the big problem
is that we're

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
living a lot in
regret in the past,

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
or we don't like the choices
that we've made in the past.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
We bring that into
the present, and then

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that automatically is
creating our future.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to
be doing is saying,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, it's the end of 2013.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I accept everything
that's gone, and I

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
take personal responsibility for
all the choices that I've made,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:90%
especially as an adult.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
These people come
into our lives.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:84%
We choose people in our lives to
give us the lessons that we're

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.260 align:middle line:84%
needing to have to learn
or to shift something.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about honoring,
and honoring ourselves

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:84%
for making those choices for
whatever reasons they were for,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and saying, OK, now
2014 is coming up.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.239 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to create?

00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
What do I want to
create differently?

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.882 align:middle line:84%
What have I learned
from those mistakes?

00:24:17.882 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And what do I want to
create differently?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.915 align:middle line:84%
So rather than me seeing it from
a negative perspective-- oh, I

00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.290 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have done that, or
I shouldn't have done this--

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
you say, OK, well that happened.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
What have I learned from it?

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:90%
What are the mistakes?

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And how am I going
to do it differently?

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.751 align:middle line:84%
How is this going to empower
me rather than dis-empower me?

00:24:33.751 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is the difference
between living shamanically

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.404 align:middle line:84%
and living in this
environment at the moment.

00:24:38.404 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
In this environment
in the moment,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:90%
we're in victim mentality.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, this happened to me.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:84%
It was this person's fault, this
government, and this, and this,

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and this.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It's everybody
else, but not them.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When we live shamanically,
we stop the blame game

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:90%
We stop the victim mentality.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.964 align:middle line:84%
And we say, OK, well, I
had choices that I've made.

00:24:57.964 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But now, I take
personal responsibility.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm in control of
where my future's going.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you take
that autonomy back.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You take that control back--
that personal control,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.740 align:middle line:90%
that personal autonomy.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's very empowering.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you stop
worrying about what's going on

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
out there and you
start coming inside.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.139 align:middle line:84%
And that's why things like
meditation or exercise

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
when you get into
the zone are really

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.597 align:middle line:84%
good moments when you can
release all that negative stuff

00:25:22.597 --> 00:25:24.180 align:middle line:84%
in the head and
really get into what's

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.680 align:middle line:90%
going on deep within you.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.119 align:middle line:84%
And deep within us is the
truth, the real truth.

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And the real truth is that
we're beautiful loving

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
beings of light,
and love-- we are.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Human beings are amazing.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.114 align:middle line:84%
They're so beautiful, and
kind, and caring, and loving,

00:25:38.114 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and they have empathy.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.529 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
don't are the ones

00:25:40.529 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:90%
that don't feel it within them.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they're creating
an externalized process

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:90%
of their pain.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:54.940 align:middle line:84%
But once you've healed
anyone-- and Buddha

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:84%
has a very good
story about that.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
When a mass murderer
who was killing

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
loads of people
around the villages--

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:03.530 align:middle line:90%
no one could stop him.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.056 align:middle line:90%
And he came across Buddha.

00:26:05.056 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And immediately
by seeing Buddha,

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.099 align:middle line:84%
he was very conscious
and very-- he

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
was totally conscious and
at peace, and awakened.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It calmed him down immediately,
brought him back to his senses.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And he became a great
saint, this mass murderer.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Buddha
says, that some

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of the major mass murderers are
actually the greatest saints,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
they just have to switch their
negative perspective around.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've got the
opportunity to murder someone,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
then you've got the capacity to
love someone at the same level.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.467 align:middle line:90%
It's just two sides of the coin.

00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just demonize
all the darkness.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you
have to embrace it

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.000 align:middle line:84%
all because within that
nugget of that mass murderer

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:90%
is an amazing seed of love.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
To have that passion to kill
has that passion to love.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
isn't being nurtured--

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.402 align:middle line:90%
this passion to love.

00:26:48.402 --> 00:26:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately with
the media as well,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
they like to demonize
and create fear.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't see all
the amazing people that

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.900 align:middle line:84%
are reforming, and changing, and
showing those seeds of love--

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and all the normal
people out there,

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.500 align:middle line:90%
they're all loving each other.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a great
faith for humanity.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I have great faith that
we're going to turn it around

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.490 align:middle line:84%
because we are amazing beings
and we are an amazing species.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What do we do with
that shadow when it starts

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:90%
popping up?

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
That shadow inside us or we
have it right in front of us--

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and it can be scary.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: It can be really
scary, it can be really scary.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's about working with it.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%
If you deny your
shadow self, it will

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
come up and kick
you in the bottom.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.145 align:middle line:84%
It just will because it'll
come out ninja style-y.

00:27:35.145 --> 00:27:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Because it has to come out.

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It has to have expression.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we are both-- we are
living in a duality reality.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.704 align:middle line:84%
And the duality reality is
the positive and negative,

00:27:44.704 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
the black and the
white, the peace

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.286 align:middle line:84%
and the war, the
love and the hate.

00:27:50.286 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We can't live on this
planet without duality.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
shadow side and then

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:90%
light side of our personalities.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we can
recognize the shadow side

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and take responsibility
for the shadow side,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and start becoming aware of
it, and acknowledging it,

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
then we are in a position to
make more conscious choices.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
consciousness is.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
It's being aware that we can
make more conscious choices.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a
situation in front of us,

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.522 align:middle line:84%
we can choose to work
with the shadow side

00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:84%
or we can choose to work
with the side of love,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness, and compassion.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But you have to reach a
point where you actually

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:24.230 align:middle line:84%
know what your shadow
side is in order

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.210 align:middle line:90%
to choose not to use that side.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's that
journey of discovery

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.427 align:middle line:90%
that I was talking about.

00:28:30.427 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's loads
of people out there.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing pantheon of
amazing books, and teachers,

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and people who have walked
this path, who are still

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
walking this path
who showing the way.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But again, you've got
your own unique shadow.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
No one has had a
shadow side like yours

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.036 align:middle line:90%
and no one has a light side.

00:28:51.036 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Every human is unique with
their own unique shadow side

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:90%
and light side.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to the
individual to find

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.896 align:middle line:84%
those skills, and those
talents, and those gifts--

00:29:00.896 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
alongside the shadow
side, as well-- in order

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to know how they want
to be in the world.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the greatness
about this planet

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.600 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all
uniquely different,

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and yet we're all
collectively interconnected.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.070 align:middle line:84%
This game is the most amazing,
unbelievable game ever.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And to be a part of it
is an amazing blessing

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and it's a magical blessing.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:84%
This time now on the
planet is-- we can really

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
go into the fear now--
the fear, and the terror,

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety,
and the stress--

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.750 align:middle line:84%
or we can choose to go into
the bliss, and the love,

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and the forgiveness, and the
compassion, and the harmony.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is a choice that
we're all going to take.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more of us
that are conscious

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.144 align:middle line:84%
will choose to take the
more enjoyable path.

00:29:50.144 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And those that aren't
conscious that are still

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.080 align:middle line:84%
connected in with the three
dimensional system of belief

00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:01.410 align:middle line:84%
of greed, and money, and
status, and all of that

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
that isn't necessarily
serving who they really are,

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.729 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to start
seeing a big struggle.

00:30:08.729 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's happening
on the planet-- there's

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
a big shift going on now--
and because it's needed too

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
because we really are
reaching a point where we're

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
going to have to change
something otherwise

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we're not leaving the planet
for future generations.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
most important thing here.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I know your
dad, Lawrence Bloom,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
is very much into the
sustainability yeah?

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.030 align:middle line:84%
You kind of took on that
journey once you came back too.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
want to bring this

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
into the big businesses, or
the corporation, or hospitality

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.550 align:middle line:84%
industry since that's
where you really

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:84%
had your shocking
moment, right, in Peru?

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Yeah, it's
difficult to know.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.440 align:middle line:84%
The future is
unwritten, so I have

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
no idea what's
going to happen next

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it's big businesses
that need to change

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:84%
or whether-- see everyone
is looking for it,

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in
big businesses,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.660 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a teacher
that's massively stressed out

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and wants to teach, but isn't
able to be who they really

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:90%
are in the teaching profession.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who is feeling
stressed and depressed,

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.696 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what they're doing,

00:31:19.696 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
they're feeling.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And since I came
back from the Amazon,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I've almost given
up my ego knowing

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.080 align:middle line:90%
of what's going to happen next.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've really
surrendered to wherever

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm meant to be, I will
to do thy will, almost.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So wherever I'm meant to be,
whatever I'm meant to be doing,

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
that's where I end up.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.508 align:middle line:84%
Because I tell you, when I
came back from the Amazon,

00:31:44.508 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I never expected to go
into the corporate world--

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.564 align:middle line:84%
not in my wildest dreams,
not in my craziest dreams.

00:31:51.564 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Because while I
was in the Amazon,

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself as a
healer, and a shaman,

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and having my healing clinic,
and doing all shamanic stuff.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism was getting
quite popular at the time.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came back and just
got this really strong message

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:84%
during meditation that that
wasn't where I was meant to be.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What, where
did that come from?

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Yeah,
I was like, well,

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.312 align:middle line:90%
what do you want me to do then?

00:32:16.312 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, I had
to kind of relinquish.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, this wonderful
dream of me being a shaman

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and floating around having my
healing clinics-- that ego,

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that ego desire--

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Floating around.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Yeah, gliding around
like looking after my minions,

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.000 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.081 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably why I
didn't end up doing it.

00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I talked to the
universe, OK, well,

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.246 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not meant
to be doing that,

00:32:40.246 --> 00:32:41.590 align:middle line:90%
where am I meant to be going?

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was running,
doing a lot of running,

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and swimming-- loads of
running and swimming.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.105 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in
Germany at the time

00:32:49.105 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:84%
up in the mountains
just outside Wiesbaden.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And slowly the message came
through in the meditations,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
in the running meditations,
when I was in the zone.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:90%
My mind had blocked out.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I could hear
the voice from within.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And it said, you have
to do a an MS Master's

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
degree in development
with a basis in economics,

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:14.327 align:middle line:84%
like development
economics, because you

00:33:14.327 --> 00:33:16.114 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to
speak the language.

00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And you need to know
what's really going on

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.400 align:middle line:84%
on the planet from an
academic point of view

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in order to be able to have that
understanding on all levels.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, really?

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:84%
No, I want to be
a lovely shaman.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
going back to uni.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But I said, OK, well, if I'm
meant to be going there--

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.557 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sure you've seen this.

00:33:34.557 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're meant to do something,
if you're in alignment,

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it's like everything just
opens up effortlessly.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.772 align:middle line:84%
And within three months, I was
sitting that degree course.

00:33:42.772 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing-- how
everything happened,

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.146 align:middle line:84%
all the doors opened,
everything opened,

00:33:46.146 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and there I was
doing the degree.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:53.199 align:middle line:84%
And then during my research for
my dissertation this company--

00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What was your
dissertation about?

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.448 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Community based
tourism as a way of alleviating

00:33:57.448 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
poverty in rural communities.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So coming from my
Machu Picchu background

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.950 align:middle line:84%
from living in Machu Picchu
and seeing how community based

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
tourism is some way of
empowering local communities

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.280 align:middle line:90%
to get them out of poverty.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't use Machu
Picchu as my research.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I used Namibia in Africa,
in southern Africa,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.060 align:middle line:84%
because they have a
background of community

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
based tourism projects.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have various different
ones that you can look at.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So I went off to Namibia,
and I did my research there.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.639 align:middle line:84%
But what I found, and this is
quite an interesting conclusion

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.553 align:middle line:84%
from the dissertation, was that
there was four different ways

00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:37.969 align:middle line:84%
of doing community
based tourisms.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And the only one
that really worked

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
was if there was
someone in charge that

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
understood Westerners'
needs and could control

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and knew what needed
to be done next,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.489 align:middle line:90%
and was overseeing everything.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And I really saw that strong
leadership in any movement

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.110 align:middle line:84%
is really, really important
because that leadership,

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that leader-- and it's
not a leader of power.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a guidance.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.394 align:middle line:84%
It's like a spiritual
guidance system.

00:35:07.394 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because in Judaism,

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.599 align:middle line:90%
that's what a Rabbi used to be.

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It used to be a spiritual
guide, never used

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:13.445 align:middle line:90%
to control the community.

00:35:13.445 --> 00:35:17.610 align:middle line:90%


00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Because people didn't
have the courage

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to make these decisions, and
if you've got a collective,

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's got loads
of different ideas,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.360 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to
get clear decision making.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you have one person
that everyone trusts,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
everyone loves,
everyone respects,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:90%
and he's like the wisdom keeper.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And he makes the decision.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the most smooth
flowing of all the community

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.931 align:middle line:90%
tourism projects that I visited.

00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
interesting for me

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because I did realize that if
you want to start something

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:50.250 align:middle line:84%
then that has to have
some type of leadership.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:52.574 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
movements have fizzled out

00:35:52.574 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't
had the leadership.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had the person
who is holding the vision

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.690 align:middle line:90%
and guiding the ship.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You always have to have
a captain on every ship.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:90%
No ship is rudderless.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You have the whole team
that works the ship,

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:84%
but it's the captain
that's guiding it.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And every movement
is like a ship.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.659 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
a captain in place,

00:36:10.659 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
or a good captain in place, or
one that's holding the vision,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
then you don't know
which wind to take.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many winds to
take to get to a destination.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.701 align:middle line:90%
So that was quite an important--

00:36:21.701 --> 00:36:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But at the
same time in society,

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
that's a big issue because
the leaders kind of, again,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:90%
think they're gods.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And the ego kicks
in, and there's

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:90%
self importance, and all that.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So how do you not
fall back in that trap

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:84%
again and recreate,
more or less,

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.286 align:middle line:90%
what's been already done here?

00:36:38.286 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole leadership
that-- this world

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:90%
needs a new kind of leadership.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: Exactly.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's a leadership coming
from a different value

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.920 align:middle line:84%
system, a different
belief system.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.942 align:middle line:84%
Leadership in itself
isn't wrong, isn't bad.

00:36:52.942 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But the leadership
that's coming is

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
coming from a value
system and a belief

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.000 align:middle line:84%
system that isn't
serving everybody.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.414 align:middle line:84%
It's serving themselves
and their shareholders.

00:37:01.414 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the new
leadership that needs

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to come in that's very much
about serving the community,

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
serving humanity,
serving mother earth.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And once you have someone in
place who is holding that--

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Selfless service.

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Selfless
service, selfless service--

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and you are starting to see that
coming through more and more.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm finding
is that anyone

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:84%
who has that kind of
ego leadership trying

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to do something spiritual it
flops straight away or very

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.950 align:middle line:84%
soon afterwards because
it doesn't fit in

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.620 align:middle line:84%
with the universal
consciousness.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.657 align:middle line:84%
So you can't say
one thing and then

00:37:36.657 --> 00:37:38.490 align:middle line:84%
do something totally
different without there

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.520 align:middle line:90%
being some massive implication.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:84%
See, I believe, my
feeling is that there's

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of business people
out there, a lot of leaders

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.990 align:middle line:84%
out there that actually think
they're doing the right thing.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
They actually think that
they're doing the right thing.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:84%
They actually believe that
what they're doing is right.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the implications
aren't so great.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing it, and
you know it's not right,

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.022 align:middle line:84%
and you know there's
something not right with it,

00:37:59.022 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're
doing something wrong--

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.566 align:middle line:84%
that's when the implications
are much greater.

00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing it
with complete conviction

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that what you're
doing is right, you

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.790 align:middle line:84%
become a very dangerous
leader because you

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.860 align:middle line:90%
don't see the overall picture.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
a lot of our leaders

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
are actually almost believing
themselves, what they're saying

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and what they're doing,
without actually--

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.250 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like they're
in that kind of denial.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting game
that's being played out.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But what's needed
is more leaders

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to come up with this different
philosophy and different belief

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:31.702 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:38:31.702 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: If there is five big
values that those companies,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:84%
or those leaders, or those
politicians, or the teachers,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
or the future gurus, or
authors, or interviewers,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is-- what
is at the core, really?

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the values that
are needed right now

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.490 align:middle line:90%
or that could guide us?

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: There's only one.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is love and
respect Mother Earth

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and all living
things and humanity.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.640 align:middle line:84%
If you love and respect all
living things and Mother Earth,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
if you're coming from that
place of real love and respect,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to harm anything.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
If that's at the front of your
belief system, then actually

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:84%
all your actions are
connected in with that.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.753 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going
to do everything that's

00:39:20.753 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:84%
going to support life on
earth and future generations.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And for me that's shamanism.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't
call it spirituality

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.410 align:middle line:84%
because spirituality has caught
itself up in a load of dogma.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Religion has caught itself
up in a load of dogma.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.761 align:middle line:84%
The problem with dogma is that
there's no room for fluidity.

00:39:37.761 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you live
shamanically-- if that's

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
your basic core belief
system is to love and respect

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth and
all living things

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and humanity as
a race of beings,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and we're all in
this together-- then

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.695 align:middle line:84%
the way you live on the planet
is in accordance with that,

00:39:52.695 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:90%
then you can't do any harm.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Because your intention is
always for the highest good.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Gaiam.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: Yeah, Gaiam.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.710 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly-- Gaiam.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we really
need to get to is that Gaiam.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:05.900 align:middle line:90%
We are part of her.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.081 align:middle line:84%
And this system can go
on for a bit longer.

00:40:09.081 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Certainly in my lifetime
it's going to be ended.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of it.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But what are we doing
for future generations?

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the biggest implication.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There's loads of babies
being born at the moment.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be a big baby boom.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.486 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what state
are we leaving this planet

00:40:24.486 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:90%
in for future generations?

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Hopi-- every
decision the Hopi

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.800 align:middle line:84%
make, it affected
seven generations down.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're making
decisions right now

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
like fracking that-- God knows
where that's going to go--

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.174 align:middle line:90%
or GM foods.

00:40:40.174 --> 00:40:42.590 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know where all
these things are going to go.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:46.426 align:middle line:84%
And really fracking,
we've hit the bottom.

00:40:46.426 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:84%
We've really hit
the very bottom.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.471 align:middle line:84%
If we're fracking, we've
hit rock bottom basically

00:40:51.471 --> 00:40:52.220 align:middle line:90%
with the fracking.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And that is very powerful.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to hit rock bottom
in order to come back up.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I really
see fracking as

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:90%
that we've hit rock bottom now.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one
way, and that is up,

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:05.582 align:middle line:90%
that is a shift and a change.

00:41:05.582 --> 00:41:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Could we finish
this interview with a poem.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:08.914 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: Yes, of course.

00:41:08.914 --> 00:41:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Which one?

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: The one that comes
to your mind right now that you

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.290 align:middle line:90%
feel is--

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: OK, great.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no problem.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm going to share
my evolutionary pathways

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:24.780 align:middle line:84%
poem because this is a poem
that I channeled in 2003.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote my book, The
Shaman's Last Apprentice.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a little
plug because I actually

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.570 align:middle line:90%
self-published it.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's available
on my website.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.005 align:middle line:84%
And it's my experiences
in the Amazon

00:41:36.005 --> 00:41:40.980 align:middle line:84%
about Amazonian Shamanism,
and how I lived in the Amazon,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of the
teachings of Don Juanito

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that he asked me to be
bring back to the West.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And after I wrote the book--
it was all quite cosmic

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.110 align:middle line:84%
how the book got written--
but this poetry came through.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And this one is called
Evolutionary Pathways.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it in
2003, and it never

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.312 align:middle line:90%
really made that much sense.

00:41:59.312 --> 00:42:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really
say it very much

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.456 align:middle line:84%
because it was a bit out
there, a bit woo-woo.

00:42:04.456 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And just in the last few
weeks even, it suddenly

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:84%
seems to make a lot of
sense and really makes sense

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.650 align:middle line:84%
with where we're
going on the planet

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
doing on the planet.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd really
like to share this

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:22.020 align:middle line:84%
with you because in 2014 we're
about to have a huge shift,

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:22.950 align:middle line:90%
a consciousness shift.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:26.100 align:middle line:90%
It had to come.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:84%
On December the 21st
2012, the planet

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the
galactic center,

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
which is where the force
of our energy is coming.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And so it aligned.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't the
end of the world.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:90%
That was all a kind of a hype.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But something did
happen, and that

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.810 align:middle line:84%
was this alignment with
the galactic center.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, it takes a while
because this universe

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.777 align:middle line:84%
is so huge, it's so
humongous, that we're not

00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:52.610 align:middle line:84%
going to feel the effects
on the day itself.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It takes time to
start feeling them.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And so this year has been
a year of really big change

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:90%
but very subtle big change.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Like things have--
relationships have

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:90%
broken up or come together.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Anything that isn't really
serving us has had to leave us.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:84%
We've had to face some of
our really dark demons.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It has been quite
a tumultuous time,

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:90%
especially since the September.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.444 align:middle line:84%
So this is in preparation
for us in 2014.

00:43:18.444 --> 00:43:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And the more preparation
we've done this year,

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the easier it will be to serve
this energetic wave that's

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.954 align:middle line:90%
coming towards us in 2014.

00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've heard a bit
about that on your journeys,

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.320 align:middle line:90%
too, haven't you?

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Yeah, and this video
will air on Gaiam in 2014.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So people-- we're already
in 2014 right now.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: Oh, perfect.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's perfect timing.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So I always suggest that
people sit back, and just

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
close their eyes, and let
the words wash over you

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.070 align:middle line:84%
because they have an
energetic vibration as well

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.660 align:middle line:90%
is it being a poem.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow the
words to wash over us,

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.630 align:middle line:84%
it can have a deeper impact
on our inner consciousness

00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and can open up things
within us that can really

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:84%
help us to understand maybe
things that we haven't really

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:90%
understood before.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.932 align:middle line:84%
So if there's been any
challenges or things

00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:05.389 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
really understand,

00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it can
happen in a poem

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.809 align:middle line:84%
that it just opens
up the consciousness

00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and gives you that answer
that you've been waiting for.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest you just sit
back and take a deep breath.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And just let out all the
energy, and stress, and anxiety

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that you may have been feeling.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.796 align:middle line:84%
Just slowly relax,
close your eyes,

00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:26.695 align:middle line:84%
and it's called
Evolutionary Pathways.

00:44:26.695 --> 00:44:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We think we're the
victims, but we just

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.650 align:middle line:84%
don't see we are
whoever we choose to be.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.370 align:middle line:84%
For every decision we
make in the present,

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.790 align:middle line:84%
the seed of the
future is inherent.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Our parents have taught us
another idea passed down

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.620 align:middle line:84%
through generations
but based on fear.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And now we've forgotten
why we are here.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
We cling to the past,
worry what's coming next.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Seem to live our lives
in constant regrets.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're beginning
to awake and starting

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to remember as the creator
stokes the evolutionary embers.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And every member
of the human race

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.970 align:middle line:84%
will soon have to
find their place

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:90%
on the evolutionary scale.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But wherever you
are, you cannot fail.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just Mother Earth is
shifting in opposite directions

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.650 align:middle line:84%
based on our
subconscious reflections.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose
to fear and hate,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.410 align:middle line:90%
that is what will be your fate.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Your state of mind will
draw to you fear and hate

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:90%
in all you say and do.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But if instead you choose
love and tranquility,

00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:35.710 align:middle line:84%
you will start to live in
your true divinity as the gods

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses that we
really are illuminating

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.270 align:middle line:90%
the light from our bright star.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:84%
For the physical body
is not really here.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just a hologram of light
that was originally clear.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.820 align:middle line:84%
But over time, it's been
tainted by fear and greed.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:53.280 align:middle line:84%
That was not part of the DNA
program of our original seed.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you heed what
I'm saying, it's

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:90%
because we can no longer hide.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.980 align:middle line:84%
It's time to let go,
and stop the fight,

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and accept that we are being
lead by following our hearts

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.840 align:middle line:90%
and not our heads.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.110 align:middle line:84%
For we have already
made the decision.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And only in the stillness
can we listen in order

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.940 align:middle line:84%
to envision what we
want to manifest.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.630 align:middle line:84%
We no longer need
to guess or walk

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.810 align:middle line:90%
through life with closed eyes.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It's time to open them,
spread wings, and fly

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to the next dimension
that is ready and waiting.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Pure and untouched with
love that's vibrating,

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.700 align:middle line:84%
pulsating joy for us to start
again as true light beings

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
in this new game for whatever
we do now, we cannot stop.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth's need
to purge the rot,

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.110 align:middle line:84%
so stop falling victim
to this 3D reality

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that has kept us locked
in karmic causality.

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Just radiate love and
joy from your inner soul,

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and it will be returned
to you a thousand

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
fold throughout aspects of
the creator that is the all.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the silence
we can hear the call

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of the great goddess who
has come to help us out.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.050 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is trust
without doubt and start living

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.120 align:middle line:84%
life as a wondrous
and magical gift.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember to smile
as the earth shifts.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Hmm, magnifique.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.390 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful-- heart opening.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Rebekah.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REBEKAH: Thank
you so much Lilou.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.024 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for inviting
me onto Gaiam.

00:47:20.024 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: My pleasure.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:90%
My delicious pleasure.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.686 align:middle line:84%
Hope you have enjoyed this
my delicious co-creators.

00:47:24.686 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Big, big kisses from
beautiful London.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REBEKAH: Bye, lots of love.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Lots of love from
this beautiful city-- bye.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:42.667 align:middle line:90%
