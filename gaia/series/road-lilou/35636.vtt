00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:10.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hello, [inaudible].

00:00:10.878 --> 00:00:13.747 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.551 align:middle line:84%
I'm in San Diego with John Gray,
that you probably recognize

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.288 align:middle line:84%
because he wrote this awesome
book called, "Men Are From Mars,

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:22.656 align:middle line:90%
Women Are From Venus."

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.993 align:middle line:84%
And this totally shifted the
life of millions of people's,

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.394 align:middle line:90%
you know, relationship.

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:31.931 align:middle line:84%
Just really you brought a whole
new perspective on what --

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.568 align:middle line:84%
how to create this
juicy relationship

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:35.903 align:middle line:90%
that actually works.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.706 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for that; and I
know you came up with many,

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:40.908 align:middle line:84%
many books and you sold
millions of copies,

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:43.144 align:middle line:90%
and your latest one is --

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:44.211 align:middle line:90%
>> John Gray: "Work With Me."

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: -- "Work With Me."

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.581 align:middle line:84%
>> John Gray: What's happened
today is since I wrote,

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.383 align:middle line:84%
"Men Are From Mars,"
men are still men

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:50.918 align:middle line:90%
and women are still women,

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.987 align:middle line:84%
but the work world has
dramatically changed.

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.456 align:middle line:84%
It's now the community
that women live in.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.525 align:middle line:84%
And it was a community
that was designed --

00:00:57.525 --> 00:01:00.728 align:middle line:84%
the rules of the workplace
are designed by men for men.

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.296 align:middle line:84%
They're not really
intentionally against women,

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.597 align:middle line:90%
but women don't feel supported.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.068 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't know
that your average woman

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.372 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace has stress
levels which are measurable,

00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:13.274 align:middle line:90%
cortisol, the stress hormone,

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.576 align:middle line:84%
twice as high as
the average male.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:17.778 align:middle line:84%
And when she returns
home, she's trying

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.748 align:middle line:84%
to balance work outside
the home and work at home,

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:23.751 align:middle line:84%
her stress levels are 4
times higher than a man.

00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:25.653 align:middle line:84%
Men don't know that,
women don't know that;

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.254 align:middle line:90%
women experience that.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:31.025 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is that we
have to increase our awareness

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:84%
of what are women
needing in the workplace,

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.763 align:middle line:84%
and expand the culture
of the workplace

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:39.567 align:middle line:84%
to not only support men,
but also to support women.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation of that
is not like everybody change,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.739 align:middle line:84%
it's actually just growing in
our awareness of our differences

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:49.043 align:middle line:84%
and understanding them
in a positive way.

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Understanding them then
allows us to feel compassion.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.449 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
when people become aware

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.849 align:middle line:90%
of this in our workshops.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.386 align:middle line:90%
Men feel much greater compassion

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:00.621 align:middle line:84%
for what women are
going through.

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.524 align:middle line:84%
And then their appreciation
of women goes up.

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:06.694 align:middle line:84%
Women experience a greater
appreciation of men.

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:10.129 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing, because
so many women assume that much

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
of the mistreatment, quote,
"mistreatment" by men,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.002 align:middle line:84%
like they feel excluded,
they feel left out,

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.771 align:middle line:84%
they feel unappreciated,
they feel unsupported,

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:19.773 align:middle line:84%
they assume that
that's intentional.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And most of it is that mean are
just oblivious, they really are.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.381 align:middle line:84%
And it's a culture that doesn't
promote in a sense the hormones

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:29.216 align:middle line:84%
in a woman that will
lower her stress.

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:31.518 align:middle line:84%
The culture promotes
the hormones

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.254 align:middle line:90%
that will lower stress in men.

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:34.555 align:middle line:90%
>> L: Yes.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.924 align:middle line:84%
But I guess we've heard a
lot that it starts from us.

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:42.263 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, as women
what can we do to shift that

00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and to be our delicious
self even at work?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: Exactly; so understanding
a woman's physiology

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.606 align:middle line:84%
from a woman's point of view can
help her, as well as help men

00:02:52.606 --> 00:02:55.709 align:middle line:84%
to help their wives, and men
to understand themselves,

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.111 align:middle line:90%
and also for our children.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:01.682 align:middle line:84%
So the new research reveals that
cortisol, the stress hormone,

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:06.053 align:middle line:84%
if you're a woman, the hormone
oxytocin is what lowers her

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.454 align:middle line:90%
stress hormone.

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:10.591 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if a woman's
in a yoga class, and she's not

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
in a hurry, and she's with a
whole bunch of other women,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.264 align:middle line:84%
and they're all in synchrony,
she doesn't feel alone,

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:90%
her oxytocin levels go up.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
If a woman's getting her hair
done, and somebody's massaging

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.974 align:middle line:84%
and washing her head, it's
a major oxytocin producer.

00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:29.143 align:middle line:84%
You know, because I get
my hair done and he wants

00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:31.545 align:middle line:84%
to wash my hair I go, "Why;
I shampooed this morning.

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:32.746 align:middle line:90%
What's the big deal?"

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:35.716 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] But women
have a greater benefit.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.952 align:middle line:84%
Shopping, for example; when
women feel they have plenty

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.189 align:middle line:84%
of time, most women who enjoy
shopping if they have time

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.459 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy it, it raises
their oxytocin levels.

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.263 align:middle line:84%
Dressing; how does she look,
how will she appear to others?

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:51.699 align:middle line:84%
When she's able to
express her beauty,

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.401 align:middle line:90%
that is an oxytocin rebuilder.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.072 align:middle line:84%
Makeup; when a woman is able
to put a little makeup on,

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
or a good skin cream, or
whatever it is so that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.611 align:middle line:84%
when she looks in the mirror she
sees her healthy self, vibrant,

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:08.415 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is when you see
beauty it inspires beauty inside

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.151 align:middle line:84%
of you, and when you feel
beautiful, like we're surrounded

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:84%
in beautiful nature here,
it awakens that inside.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.889 align:middle line:84%
And that is an oxytocin
producer.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.026 align:middle line:84%
So this is like to become
aware for women of the things

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:90%
that help them to cope

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.364 align:middle line:84%
with stress is very,
very significant.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.832 align:middle line:84%
>> L: I hear that
then it's important

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:26.967 align:middle line:90%
to cultivate the feminine side,

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.503 align:middle line:84%
because we became
very masculine, huh?

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.538 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: Well, that's what I
talk about in "Work With Me,"

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:35.476 align:middle line:84%
the new book, which is my
coauthor, Barbara Annis,

00:04:35.476 --> 00:04:37.144 align:middle line:84%
who's been working in
the corporate world

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:39.046 align:middle line:84%
and now teaches gender
intelligence

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:41.849 align:middle line:84%
in the corporate world, which
is what we teach together now.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.419 align:middle line:84%
And she was what she calls
herself, "the third sex,"

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.888 align:middle line:84%
meaning she's a woman,
but she became a man

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.456 align:middle line:84%
to be successful
in the workplace.

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:53.427 align:middle line:84%
And she saw that she was burning
out, and many of her other women

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:55.396 align:middle line:84%
in that situation
were burning out.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:57.331 align:middle line:84%
We now have the actual
research showing

00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.167 align:middle line:84%
that women's stress
levels shoot up much higher

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.502 align:middle line:90%
when they're in the workplace.

00:05:01.502 --> 00:05:04.271 align:middle line:84%
Why is that; because it's
the workplace that's designed

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:07.441 align:middle line:84%
to support men, not
against women.

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:08.876 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember
that; and that's part

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:10.811 align:middle line:84%
of what would help women
experience less stress

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.614 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace, at least to
feel like it's not intentionally

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.716 align:middle line:90%
against her, but to recognize

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that whenever you're
making a sacrifice for money

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.789 align:middle line:84%
for a man it releases
testosterone

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.424 align:middle line:90%
and lowers his stress.

00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:26.794 align:middle line:84%
When a woman makes a sacrifice
for money, she gets money

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:30.097 align:middle line:84%
to pay bills at home, but
it doesn't lower her stress.

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:33.734 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you make a sacrifice,
it releases testosterone.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're in an emergency
job, or an urgency job,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.307 align:middle line:84%
or a deadline, or you make
the client more important

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:41.642 align:middle line:90%
than yourself.

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:42.876 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the rules
of the workplace, you know,

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:46.246 align:middle line:84%
client first, yes is
always the answer.

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:47.314 align:middle line:90%
You're not allowed to say,

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:49.616 align:middle line:84%
"What is personally
fulfilling for me?"

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.585 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the
female values that comes

00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.755 align:middle line:84%
into the workplace as we begin
to hear this from women more.

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, men are not
allowed to complain.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.828 align:middle line:84%
You're a wimp, you're a
whiner if you complain,

00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:02.062 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to say, "Hey,

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:04.498 align:middle line:84%
we could improve the
conditions of the workplace."

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
As women have come
into the workplace,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.202 align:middle line:84%
conditions are dramatically
improving,

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:10.504 align:middle line:90%
not just for women, but for men.

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
And the acceleration of this
process can be dramatically

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:17.578 align:middle line:84%
increased in a positive way
with greater understanding

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.746 align:middle line:84%
of those differences
in a positive way.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.016 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call "gender
intelligence," the intelligence

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:24.918 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take
diversity, and particularly one

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:27.721 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest diversities
is between men and women,

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:29.523 align:middle line:90%
and unite those worlds.

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:32.493 align:middle line:84%
So we found with 8 blind
spots -- and this is --

00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:34.561 align:middle line:84%
actually they all relate
to home, but we found it

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:37.664 align:middle line:84%
in our survey of 250,000
people in the workplace

00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%
in 60 Fortune 500 companies.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.204 align:middle line:84%
We go in and we take a survey
before they take the workshop.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:45.839 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, men are blown away.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.407 align:middle line:90%
They just go, "I didn't know."

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.575 align:middle line:84%
You see, there are
so many things

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.811 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
that we don't know.

00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:51.912 align:middle line:90%
>> L: Yes, yes.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:52.913 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: And when that's
pointed out to you,

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.248 align:middle line:90%
you go, "I just didn't know."

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:55.983 align:middle line:84%
It's like say there's a
door that you can walk

00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:58.819 align:middle line:84%
through the wall right here,
but I don't know what's there,

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.287 align:middle line:90%
I'll always go the long route.

00:07:00.287 --> 00:07:03.023 align:middle line:84%
And somebody says, "You know,
there's a door right here."

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:04.424 align:middle line:90%
"I didn't know."

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:08.395 align:middle line:84%
It's an easy adaptation when you
raise understanding and insight.

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So here's an example, 1 of the 8
"blind spots," we call them is,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.402 align:middle line:90%
"Are women feeling excluded?"

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:18.038 align:middle line:90%
If you ask men in corporations,

00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.007 align:middle line:84%
"Do you exclude the
women you work with?"

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:21.408 align:middle line:90%
"No. I think they're wonderful.

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:90%
They have equal opportunity."

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.046 align:middle line:84%
Ask the women, and
over 60% of women feel,

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:28.715 align:middle line:84%
personally feel,
"I'm being excluded."

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> L: "I'm not in
the boys' club."

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.684 align:middle line:90%
>> JG: That's exactly it.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:31.952 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the aspects.

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you take it personally.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're
pushing against them.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.156 align:middle line:90%
It's a fight.

00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:84%
And granted, 30 years ago it
was a fight for women to prove

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.627 align:middle line:84%
that they can do
everything a man can do,

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.563 align:middle line:90%
but they had to do it like men.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.565 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to bring in as
an awareness of the strengths,

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.569 align:middle line:84%
not just that the differences
are positive, but the strengths

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:51.438 align:middle line:84%
that women have are amazing
to bring into the workplace.

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:90%
So here's a little takeaway.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.077 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting at a table with
my team, 3 men, 3 women.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:08:00.547 align:middle line:84%
We're discussing something,
our plans, we meet every week.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And in that meeting 2
women might not be talking.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.587 align:middle line:84%
Most men will assume,
"If she's not talking,

00:08:06.587 --> 00:08:08.322 align:middle line:90%
she has nothing to say."

00:08:08.322 --> 00:08:10.257 align:middle line:84%
But often women are
waiting to be invited

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:11.658 align:middle line:90%
into the conversation.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:14.962 align:middle line:84%
It may be happening at a speed
that is not inclusive to her;

00:08:14.962 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
realize, well all men have

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.068 align:middle line:84%
at least 30 times more
testosterone than women.

00:08:21.068 --> 00:08:24.304 align:middle line:84%
And testosterone allows you to
jump in there and react fast.

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:27.774 align:middle line:84%
That's what testosterone is,
it's a flight or fight response

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:31.044 align:middle line:84%
for men is to run fast,
act fast, to think fast,

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:84%
often without thinking
to say something.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.648 align:middle line:84%
So women are -- sometimes women
are like trying to take all this

00:08:35.648 --> 00:08:37.351 align:middle line:84%
in because they're
good listeners,

00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
and it's like there's
no room for her to come

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
into the conversation.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So when the men hear this, and
they hear all the women saying

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.458 align:middle line:90%
that they say, "Well, I thought

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.426 align:middle line:84%
that you always had
opportunity to speak up."

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:48.428 align:middle line:84%
And with that awareness
I'm able to notice

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:51.131 align:middle line:84%
when women aren't talking I
don't assume they have nothing

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.398 align:middle line:90%
to say.

00:08:52.398 --> 00:08:54.434 align:middle line:84%
I assume they're thinking
deeply, and I'll say like,

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.937 align:middle line:84%
"Marci, you've had a lot
of experience with this.

00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:58.405 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?"

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.307 align:middle line:90%
And then she had so much to say.

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
There's always so much more that
women want to add to the table

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.147 align:middle line:84%
that often doesn't come out
because women feel excluded.

00:09:07.147 --> 00:09:08.181 align:middle line:90%
>> L: We don't communicate

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:11.251 align:middle line:84%
at all the same way
in the workplace.

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Like it seems like
we just don't have --

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.789 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't come out the same
way, and then men don't even --

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:90%
maybe even understand us.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.992 align:middle line:90%
So we even withdraw.

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:20.127 align:middle line:90%
>> JG: Well, there's 2 aspects

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.996 align:middle line:84%
to how men misunderstand
women in that example.

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.432 align:middle line:84%
One is that women often
see a bigger picture.

00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:27.467 align:middle line:84%
They're going to take
into more considerations,

00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:29.903 align:middle line:84%
whereas men are kind of like
refocused on, "How do we get

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:31.505 align:middle line:90%
from point A to point B?"

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:34.107 align:middle line:84%
Women might point out, "Well,
how would that affect others?

00:09:34.107 --> 00:09:37.077 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect
farther into the future?

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.012 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate
to more in the past?

00:09:39.012 --> 00:09:40.213 align:middle line:90%
What have we seen?"

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:41.882 align:middle line:84%
So she's going to
have a bigger picture.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:45.085 align:middle line:84%
And often men think,
"She's slowing us down."

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.454 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a great
commercial for a phone company

00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
with a bunch of children
in a kindergarten class,

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.793 align:middle line:84%
and the man's saying, "Which
is better, fast or slow?"

00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:55.195 align:middle line:84%
And they're all saying,
"Fast, fast, fast."

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.365 align:middle line:84%
Well, fast is good sometimes,
and slow is good sometimes.

00:09:58.365 --> 00:10:01.234 align:middle line:84%
And often women will bring
up more considerations

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:04.504 align:middle line:84%
and men will often think, "Well,
she's just slowing us down."

00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:06.506 align:middle line:84%
But if we could actually
see that that's a virtue

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:09.109 align:middle line:84%
and a value, and if
women don't exploit that,

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.078 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes businesses
will have a committee

00:10:11.078 --> 00:10:12.779 align:middle line:90%
that goes on talking forever.

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.682 align:middle line:84%
So often women when I explore it
more through verbal conversation

00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.685 align:middle line:84%
of the possibilities and
opportunities and so forth,

00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:21.154 align:middle line:84%
they're also very
wise in enlisting --

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:23.356 align:middle line:90%
creating a sense of inclusion,

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.193 align:middle line:84%
because to truly motivate people
you want to include people

00:10:26.193 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle line:84%
and then they become
more motivated.

00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.031 align:middle line:84%
So that's one aspect
of the differences.

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:34.534 align:middle line:84%
One of the blind spots we saw
was another question, which is,

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:37.104 align:middle line:84%
"Are women too emotional
in the workplace?"

00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:39.606 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, most
women said, "No."

00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:41.408 align:middle line:90%
And most men said, "Yes,"

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:43.376 align:middle line:84%
and they just don't
know what to do with it.

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
And we asked another question,
which is, "Do men walk

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%
on eggshells in the workplace?"

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.217 align:middle line:84%
And women said, "Yes," and
men said, "Yes," [laughs]

00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.618 align:middle line:90%
when they're dealing with women.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:54.521 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is not
understanding how women cope

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:58.023 align:middle line:84%
with stress quite commonly,
or men cope with stress.

00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
In the back of the brain there's
the fight or flight center.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.896 align:middle line:84%
When we're under stress,
blood flows there.

00:11:02.896 --> 00:11:06.133 align:middle line:84%
And for a man it then goes to
the action part of the brain.

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:09.236 align:middle line:84%
So a man wants to either do
something or think about it.

00:11:09.236 --> 00:11:11.138 align:middle line:84%
He detaches -- the
first reaction is

00:11:11.138 --> 00:11:13.573 align:middle line:90%
to detach from emotions.

00:11:13.573 --> 00:11:18.078 align:middle line:84%
For a woman the first reaction
is to connect with her emotions.

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:20.247 align:middle line:84%
So women will have an
emotional response,

00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:24.651 align:middle line:84%
which men don't realize is just
a little wave, and it passes.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:27.554 align:middle line:84%
But for a minute she might
tear up, she might have a sense

00:11:27.554 --> 00:11:30.457 align:middle line:84%
of urgency, of fear in her
voice, or she have a sense

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:32.025 align:middle line:90%
of frustration in her voice.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.827 align:middle line:84%
And a man goes, "Well, you
shouldn't feel that way.

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:84%
You're making a big
deal out of nothing."

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.964 align:middle line:84%
And she's not making
a big deal out of it.

00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:40.567 align:middle line:84%
The man is misinterpreting
her reaction

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.736 align:middle line:90%
as if she's making a big deal.

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.572 align:middle line:84%
And this is also in our
personal relationships as well.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:48.341 align:middle line:84%
All these things do bleed over
to the personal relationship.

00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:50.177 align:middle line:84%
So often men will
tell their wives,

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.611 align:middle line:90%
you know, "It's not a big deal.

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:52.579 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:53.814 align:middle line:90%
It's not a problem.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.949 align:middle line:84%
I'll take care of it,
dear," that kind of a thing.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:58.018 align:middle line:84%
And she's not saying,
"I can't handle it."

00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
See, the women in the workplace
might have an emotional

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.222 align:middle line:84%
reaction, but that emotional
reaction doesn't mean,

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
"I can't handle it."

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.626 align:middle line:84%
But men interpret it that
way for a simple reason.

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:08.528 align:middle line:90%
Men's brains are different.

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:11.998 align:middle line:84%
And men's brains they
only become emotional

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
when they can't handle it.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So for a man even if I'm chased
by -- if I'm in a tiger's cage,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.637 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be emotional

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:19.406 align:middle line:84%
because I have some
training with that.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.709 align:middle line:84%
But if I get emotional, it
means I'm out of control.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:25.946 align:middle line:84%
So men in a sense are
designed only to get emotional

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:29.416 align:middle line:84%
if their problem is huge,
like a lion, a tiger, a bear,

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:31.518 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly we feel
out of control,

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
then we get emotional
and we feel fear.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.622 align:middle line:84%
So fear comes up,
strong emotion.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:38.992 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, men don't have those
feelings generally speaking,

00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:40.093 align:middle line:90%
if they have confidence.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:41.495 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of them don't
have the confidence,

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:43.129 align:middle line:84%
they don't have the
training, and so they go

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.598 align:middle line:90%
over to their emotional side,

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:46.366 align:middle line:84%
where they're not going
to be as productive.

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.401 align:middle line:84%
For women their first
reaction is supposed

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.937 align:middle line:84%
to be emotional to
small stresses.

00:12:50.937 --> 00:12:53.139 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman is having
an emotional reaction

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.742 align:middle line:84%
to a small stress, out of
frustration, or disappointment,

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:58.311 align:middle line:84%
or a concern, "But wait, we
can't do that because of this,"

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:01.147 align:middle line:84%
and a guy goes, "Why is she
getting so emotional about this?

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:02.616 align:middle line:90%
Can't she handle this?"

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.452 align:middle line:84%
Because if a man gets
emotional about little problems,

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.454 align:middle line:84%
it's a sign he really
can't handle it.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:10.457 align:middle line:84%
So it's a symptom of
incompetence on Mars

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.493 align:middle line:84%
so men are taught to not show
emotions in the workplace.

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:15.829 align:middle line:84%
But for women this is a
female value coming in.

00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:19.099 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are really powerful
because they help women to cope

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:22.102 align:middle line:84%
with stress and they always have
some wisdom, because they point

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:24.804 align:middle line:84%
out how we have to
adjust our expectations.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:26.439 align:middle line:90%
They help us to become flexible.

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:28.475 align:middle line:84%
They help us to see
things differently.

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.477 align:middle line:84%
And she always has a
different perspective.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing if we can just
open our minds and our hearts

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.882 align:middle line:90%
to valuing what women bring in.

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:38.351 align:middle line:84%
But men don't know
what men don't know.

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:40.053 align:middle line:84%
That's the -- they think
they already know it all,

00:13:40.053 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea of
these gender differences

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.124 align:middle line:90%
and these blind spots.

00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed the other day
I was in a hurry driving,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that when
you're going really fast,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.099 align:middle line:84%
it's even more important to
realize there's blind spots

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:56.102 align:middle line:84%
in your car, because you
can shift lanes very quickly

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:57.704 align:middle line:90%
and run right into somebody.

00:13:57.704 --> 00:13:58.872 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening right now

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:84%
in a historical perspective
is an accelerated,

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
fast transformation never
before in history have men

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.117 align:middle line:84%
and women worked hand-in-hand,
side-by-side in the work world

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:14.154 align:middle line:84%
and then participating
equally in the home life.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.189 align:middle line:84%
This is just not the
history of this planet.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:19.759 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge shift and it's
accelerated very, very quickly

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.895 align:middle line:84%
so it's even more important
that we become aware

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.331 align:middle line:90%
of our own blind spots.

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:27.233 align:middle line:84%
For men we tend to be
oblivious of who women are,

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:28.969 align:middle line:84%
what they need, what
they can offer,

00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:31.037 align:middle line:84%
and how they communicate
differently.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:33.573 align:middle line:84%
For women they tend
to be oblivious

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that men are not
intending to exclude them,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.914 align:middle line:84%
that men are not
appreciating them purposefully.

00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.648 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was
a time, and still is

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:45.919 align:middle line:90%
to some extent, rampant sexism.

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:48.221 align:middle line:84%
But today there's
an openness in men,

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.756 align:middle line:90%
they just need the education.

00:14:49.756 --> 00:14:52.826 align:middle line:84%
So in one study at Harvard
showed that if somebody steps

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:56.162 align:middle line:84%
on your foot, your stress levels
go up a little and they go down.

00:14:56.162 --> 00:14:58.198 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody steps
on your foot

00:14:58.198 --> 00:15:02.102 align:middle line:84%
and you feel it was intentional,
then you've got days of mulling

00:15:02.102 --> 00:15:04.704 align:middle line:84%
over and thinking about it, and
it carries over into everything

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:06.172 align:middle line:90%
and it gradually builds up.

00:15:06.172 --> 00:15:07.574 align:middle line:90%
So that's sort of the benefit.

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.542 align:middle line:84%
For women can learn
for themselves,

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:11.111 align:middle line:90%
men can learn for themselves.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But as females, as women
understand their husbands

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.016 align:middle line:84%
better, their workplace
better, then they have --

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:18.952 align:middle line:84%
they learn a new way to
communicate with men.

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.787 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of
women today who have gotten

00:15:20.787 --> 00:15:23.723 align:middle line:84%
in very top places because
they could think like men.

00:15:23.723 --> 00:15:25.191 align:middle line:84%
They understand the
way men think,

00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
they understand how
to motivate a man.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.162 align:middle line:84%
If you confront men
with negativity,

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:31.531 align:middle line:90%
or complaint, he just turns off.

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:34.234 align:middle line:84%
But learning how to ask for
what you want, learning how

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to give feedback in a way that's
flattering, as opposed to --

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.806 align:middle line:84%
well instead of saying,
"I don't understand that,"

00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:40.874 align:middle line:90%
say something like, "Well,

00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:42.208 align:middle line:84%
that's something I
haven't thought about.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Help me to understand
that better."

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.614 align:middle line:84%
And then also saying something
like, "That makes sense."

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:84%
But I have another
way of looking at it,

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.518 align:middle line:84%
but first acknowledge
what you've heard.

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:53.987 align:middle line:84%
Instead of feeling like
you're with an enemy,

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:84%
you're with someone
who really truly wants

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.323 align:middle line:90%
to support you as well.

00:15:57.323 --> 00:15:59.492 align:middle line:84%
And there's this win-win
awareness that we have

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.061 align:middle line:84%
to bring more into
the workplace,

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
both on the female side
and on the male side.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.599 align:middle line:84%
But what I help women to
understand over and over,

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.701 align:middle line:84%
there's so much potential
you can get out of men

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:10.937 align:middle line:84%
if you just know
how to talk to them.

00:16:10.937 --> 00:16:14.074 align:middle line:84%
>> L: [Laughs] We hear
lots of the men --

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.843 align:middle line:84%
you know, this balance
needs to happen in all of us

00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:84%
between the masculine and the
feminine energy inside of us.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But is that really --
you're not really saying yes

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.318 align:middle line:90%
to that, are you?

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.087 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: Well, I'm saying
yes and I'm saying no,

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:28.788 align:middle line:84%
because I'm like the
forerunner of all this.

00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.758 align:middle line:84%
You know, 30 years ago I
was like pure feminist,

00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:33.393 align:middle line:84%
"Let's make men all
into good wives."

00:16:33.393 --> 00:16:35.328 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] Because that's what
the women wanted, you know,

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.496 align:middle line:90%
"I wanted to be in his heart.

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to share his feelings.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.499 align:middle line:84%
I wanted him to talk
about his day."

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.901 align:middle line:84%
So I taught men how to do that
and the women wanted a divorce,

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.002 align:middle line:90%
women were not turned on,

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:44.838 align:middle line:84%
because he becomes
like a girlfriend.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:45.972 align:middle line:90%
>> L: Yes.

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:47.307 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: You know, they
want him to be a man,

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.808 align:middle line:84%
but then they also want him
to have some sensitivities.

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:51.444 align:middle line:84%
When a woman is saying, you
know, "I want you to open up,"

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:54.147 align:middle line:84%
really what she's saying
is, "I want you to hear me."

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:56.616 align:middle line:84%
But often when women want to be
heard the first thing they say

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:58.885 align:middle line:84%
to a man is, "Tell
me about your day."

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:01.221 align:middle line:84%
When really what a woman can
do is say, "Hey, you don't have

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.755 align:middle line:84%
to say anything if
you don't want to,

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:90%
I just need your attention.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.494 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you about my
day, and you just have to listen

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and I'll feel better and give
you a big hug afterwards.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.031 align:middle line:84%
And I'd prefer if
you say nothing."

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.801 align:middle line:84%
You see, this is like something
a woman would never think of,

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:17.137 align:middle line:84%
because if you said that to
a girlfriend she'd hate you.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
"What do you mean, this is
a one-sided conversation?"

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.876 align:middle line:84%
And many women when I teach this
in the beginning they will say,

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.077 align:middle line:90%
"Well, that's not what I want.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
I want a sharing back
and forth," and so forth.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.947 align:middle line:84%
They have these ideas
of what it looks

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
like when a man is balanced
in his masculine and feminine,

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.485 align:middle line:84%
which are completely
unrealistic.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, when it comes to
romance, and that's where it's

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
so unrealistic on our
personal relationships,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:38.925 align:middle line:84%
because in the beginning
men are thinking, "Okay.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:39.859 align:middle line:90%
How can I impress her?

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:40.693 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:17:40.693 --> 00:17:42.095 align:middle line:90%
What's my [inaudible]?

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:45.899 align:middle line:84%
But once he achieves the goal,
that all relaxes, and it's gone.

00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:47.667 align:middle line:84%
And she feels like,
"Hey, what happened?

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:48.902 align:middle line:90%
You don't love me anymore?"

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.171 align:middle line:84%
Has nothing to do with
whether he loves you or not.

00:17:51.171 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with his education.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:54.808 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't understood
what it takes

00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:56.509 align:middle line:90%
to make a relationship work.

00:17:56.509 --> 00:17:58.945 align:middle line:84%
But a woman would -- once again,
will tend to take it personally

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:01.281 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
assumptions about him

00:18:01.281 --> 00:18:02.815 align:middle line:90%
that aren't true at all.

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:05.151 align:middle line:84%
So how do you create
romance, and why do we want

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:06.853 align:middle line:90%
so much romance today?

00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:08.087 align:middle line:90%
Because, you know, the whole --

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
in a sense the romantic
ideal was Romeo and Juliet,

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:84%
someone you'd give
your life for.

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.961 align:middle line:84%
But then they die as teenagers
before they get married.

00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:16.596 align:middle line:90%
If they'd gotten married,

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.431 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] they would have stopped
having sex 10 years later

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.934 align:middle line:84%
and had affairs like
everybody else at that time.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:24.571 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's -- romance
is a new phenomenon.

00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:25.772 align:middle line:90%
And we can make it happen,

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.373 align:middle line:84%
but we have to be
practical about it.

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So one practical tool for
creating romance is don't wait

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.178 align:middle line:90%
for him to be romantic,

00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:34.247 align:middle line:84%
and don't be the man,
but be the woman.

00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So what a woman's design is
to go purely to your female

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:84%
for a few hours a week,
because see the thing is we have

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:90%
a balance.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:84%
When a woman's in the workplace
she's on her male side.

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:44.991 align:middle line:84%
Having romance in her
life is a way to come back

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.859 align:middle line:90%
to being the pure feminine.

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle line:84%
So to be pure feminine basically
you're opening up to receive.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:52.298 align:middle line:90%
Become an expert at receiving.

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:55.335 align:middle line:84%
So what is the first thing an
expert receiver has to learn,

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:90%
how to ask for what you want,

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.405 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate
what you'd like;

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:02.342 align:middle line:84%
in a way that motivates the
other person to go, "Yes,"

00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:05.712 align:middle line:84%
instead of assuming that if he
loves me he'll automatically

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:09.115 align:middle line:84%
know, because that's
what so many women feel.

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:11.951 align:middle line:84%
So a practical skill is
to tell your husband --

00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:15.221 align:middle line:84%
every week that's your job, tell
him what you'd like, and say,

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
"Here are 3 things that I
would love to do next week.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.092 align:middle line:90%
Will you pick one?

00:19:19.092 --> 00:19:22.495 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what it is once you've
picked, and I'll plan for that."

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it will be this
amount of time.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And she has to hold it in
her mind, "This is her time."

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.103 align:middle line:84%
Yes; he gets his
time, and, you know,

00:19:30.103 --> 00:19:32.672 align:middle line:84%
he has other things he does,
but this is the thing for her.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.842 align:middle line:84%
Often women have a hard time
even deciding what they would

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
like, because in their
minds they're going, "Well,

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.178 align:middle line:84%
what do I like that
he would like?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.513 align:middle line:84%
What do I like that
he would like?

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.715 align:middle line:84%
Because all it takes is a
few experiences in a marriage

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:44.651 align:middle line:84%
where you say what you
liked and you went along,

00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:46.753 align:middle line:84%
and then you complained
about it, and whatever.

00:19:46.753 --> 00:19:49.689 align:middle line:84%
So men have to learn on
that date, "Don't complain.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It's for her."

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.027 align:middle line:84%
Say to him, "This is your
gift to me, all for me.

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.729 align:middle line:84%
It's only 2 hours, 3 hours,"
because he might complain.

00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:57.964 align:middle line:84%
He might say, "Well, I
don't want to go do that."

00:19:57.964 --> 00:19:59.032 align:middle line:84%
"I know you don't
want to do that.

00:19:59.032 --> 00:19:59.999 align:middle line:90%
Why would you want to do that?

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.534 align:middle line:90%
That must be very boring to you.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:03.069 align:middle line:84%
'And I could go do
that with my friends,

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.203 align:middle line:84%
I know that's what
you're going to tell me,

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.538 align:middle line:90%
you can go with your friends.

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.774 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
sometimes I really want

00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:08.641 align:middle line:90%
to be there with you.

00:20:08.641 --> 00:20:10.143 align:middle line:90%
And it will feel so good to me.

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:13.313 align:middle line:84%
It would make me so happy
if you'd do this for me."

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:14.681 align:middle line:90%
He would do it.

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:84%
But most women don't know to
put themselves out like that.

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.452 align:middle line:84%
They feel like well then
I'll owe him or something.

00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:22.488 align:middle line:84%
It's like create an
opportunity for him

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:24.424 align:middle line:90%
to be successful for you.

00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's an art to that,
lots of pieces to that.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.196 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the aspects is
if 2 women went to a restaurant

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:32.465 align:middle line:84%
and the beans were bad,
too salty, they could talk

00:20:32.465 --> 00:20:34.901 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the evening
about how bad those beans were,

00:20:34.901 --> 00:20:36.703 align:middle line:84%
how they had better
bean recipes,

00:20:36.703 --> 00:20:39.072 align:middle line:84%
how this restaurant's
overcharging.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.441 align:middle line:84%
But by sharing about problems
they would feel bonded

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.709 align:middle line:90%
and connected.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:45.445 align:middle line:84%
But if your husband or boyfriend
takes to the restaurant,

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.447 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to talk
about how bad the beans are

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:49.148 align:middle line:84%
because he feels
like he's the cook.

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:51.784 align:middle line:84%
If he's bringing something for
you, just as you're opening

00:20:51.784 --> 00:20:54.387 align:middle line:84%
up to be receptive,
he's like no defenses.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:56.889 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to be your hero,
he's trying to be there for you,

00:20:56.889 --> 00:20:58.725 align:middle line:90%
he's trying to be supportive.

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:02.462 align:middle line:84%
And realize that the best way
to make a man feel successful is

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate what he gives you.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.733 align:middle line:84%
And women don't realize how
personally men will tend

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:08.101 align:middle line:90%
to take it.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.169 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time I
realized this is I'd brought my

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:12.405 align:middle line:84%
wife to a movie and
I realized halfway

00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
through this was not
a movie she liked.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.942 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of like a
little depressed, you know,

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:17.844 align:middle line:84%
feeling like, "Bummer, I
brought this to this movie."

00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:20.079 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards I said
to her I said, "Well,

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.447 align:middle line:90%
did you like the movie?"

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:25.651 align:middle line:84%
She said, "You know, that sunset
scene was really beautiful."

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.753 align:middle line:90%
I went, "Yes."

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:28.154 align:middle line:84%
And we wouldn't talk
anything more about it.

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I clearly got the message, but
she didn't have to give it to me

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.493 align:middle line:84%
at that time, just say
something positive.

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:36.796 align:middle line:84%
So on a romantic date, just as
she dresses up and he plans it

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.165 align:middle line:84%
and does his best
behavior, she should be

00:21:39.165 --> 00:21:40.266 align:middle line:90%
on her best behavior too

00:21:40.266 --> 00:21:42.969 align:middle line:84%
and understand what
makes men feel good

00:21:42.969 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:84%
and successful in
making her happy.

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:48.875 align:middle line:84%
>> L: So how does that work
when let's say there's something

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:52.178 align:middle line:84%
that your partner does every
day that drives you crazy

00:21:52.178 --> 00:21:54.781 align:middle line:84%
and you would like a change, for
example he throws the clothes

00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:57.417 align:middle line:84%
on the floor, or he doesn't
put the seat down, or whatever?

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:58.584 align:middle line:90%
What is your way?

00:21:58.584 --> 00:22:00.019 align:middle line:90%
What advice do you have?

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:01.854 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: Each one of those
is a specific issue.

00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:03.089 align:middle line:90%
So let's do toilet seats

00:22:03.089 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
since everybody talks
about toilet seats.

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.093 align:middle line:90%
So a man will use logic.

00:22:07.093 --> 00:22:10.363 align:middle line:84%
He'll say, "Hey, why can't
you just put it down?

00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:12.398 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have to put it up,

00:22:12.398 --> 00:22:14.333 align:middle line:84%
so if we're like equals
in a relationship?"

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.602 align:middle line:84%
That's where we have to
realize that we're equals,

00:22:16.602 --> 00:22:17.937 align:middle line:90%
but we have different needs.

00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:21.274 align:middle line:84%
And one of the secrets of
what women need today is

00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:22.742 align:middle line:90%
that what makes women happy,

00:22:22.742 --> 00:22:26.012 align:middle line:84%
which is also what creates
oxytocin is little acts

00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:29.549 align:middle line:84%
of affection, noticing,
hearing, touching,

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:31.717 align:middle line:90%
planning, nurturing activities.

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So like I could bring
my wife 36 roses,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.656 align:middle line:84%
and in my mind I'm giving
her -- I'm getting 36 points.

00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:39.058 align:middle line:84%
But actually I can give one
rose and I get one point,

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:42.128 align:middle line:84%
and if I give 36 roses, I'm
actually just getting one point.

00:22:42.128 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:90%
Men don't realize this.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:90%
They don't get it.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.365 align:middle line:84%
Little things make a
big difference to women.

00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:49.001 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes little things make
a bigger difference to women.

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
You know, like an example let's
say you're having some tension

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.972 align:middle line:84%
and he comes in with
a big diamond ring.

00:22:52.972 --> 00:22:55.074 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women might feel
like, "You think that's going

00:22:55.074 --> 00:22:56.342 align:middle line:90%
to resolve everything?"

00:22:56.342 --> 00:22:59.045 align:middle line:84%
You know, we bring her a
little rose, and take her out,

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.214 align:middle line:84%
listen to her talk,
then slowly you build

00:23:01.214 --> 00:23:02.682 align:middle line:90%
up these oxytocin levels

00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:05.585 align:middle line:84%
to where she feels happy
and more fulfilled.

00:23:05.585 --> 00:23:08.187 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to the toilet
seat an easy way of solving

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:10.690 align:middle line:84%
that is, "I'm looking
for opportunities

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.059 align:middle line:84%
to do little things to
make her feel special.

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:15.828 align:middle line:84%
So putting the toilet seat
down is my little gift to her."

00:23:15.828 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's my action.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.333 align:middle line:84%
But her action always needs to
be response, not like, "Well,

00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:21.934 align:middle line:90%
he should because I'm a woman."

00:23:21.934 --> 00:23:25.171 align:middle line:84%
Instead in my house whenever
my wife or my daughter --

00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:28.074 align:middle line:84%
one of my daughters sits -- they
don't live in the house anymore.

00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm visiting one
of my daughters' house,

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.946 align:middle line:84%
she goes into the bathroom,
she says, "Thank you, dad,"

00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.781 align:middle line:84%
because she sees the
toilet seat down.

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.583 align:middle line:84%
This is what women
have to understand is

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.653 align:middle line:84%
that even though you think
men should do certain things,

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:41.787 align:middle line:90%
when they do those things,

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
make sure to acknowledge
it and appreciate it.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.125 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes men
remember and gets men

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to do it again and again.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.296 align:middle line:84%
And I did my very best to
try to remember at my house

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.065 align:middle line:84%
with 3 daughters and my
wife, and I kept forgetting

00:23:53.065 --> 00:23:56.068 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting until my youngest
daughter said, "You know,

00:23:56.068 --> 00:23:58.337 align:middle line:84%
dad's doing this for us,
and we're always pointing

00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:00.206 align:middle line:84%
out to him how --
when he doesn't do it.

00:24:00.206 --> 00:24:02.041 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying
when he does do it."

00:24:02.041 --> 00:24:04.777 align:middle line:84%
So she started appreciating
every time, "Dad, thank you."

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:07.313 align:middle line:84%
Of course I'm going to
remember to do that.

00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:10.316 align:middle line:84%
>> L: And so when it hasn't
even started yet and you want

00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:12.985 align:middle line:84%
to communicate the fact that
those clothes shouldn't be

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
down there, but should
be up here?

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.156 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: Well, I went to through
one in my house as well.

00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:19.525 align:middle line:84%
Men tend to be more oblivious
of their environment.

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.094 align:middle line:84%
There are a small percent of men
who are actually much more aware

00:24:22.094 --> 00:24:25.364 align:middle line:84%
of their environment, sometimes
very challenging for women to be

00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:27.133 align:middle line:84%
with because they tend
to be perfectionists,

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.135 align:middle line:84%
and then she feels under
pressure all the time.

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:31.137 align:middle line:90%
So that's not always the ideal.

00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a nice thing about if
your husband's a little messy,

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.909 align:middle line:84%
because you will always be
seen as better than him.

00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:38.311 align:middle line:84%
There's just a little
aspect to that,

00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:39.612 align:middle line:90%
see the positive side of it.

00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time my
wife used to say to me,

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:44.717 align:middle line:84%
"Can't you remember to put
your t-shirts in the hamper?"

00:24:44.717 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Honey,
I try, I try.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.487 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing against it."

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:50.256 align:middle line:84%
She says, "It's only
this far away."

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:51.891 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "I take
off my t-shirt

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:53.259 align:middle line:84%
and I'm putting on
something else.

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think of it.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.763 align:middle line:84%
So you have to train me on this
and I'm open to being trained."

00:24:57.763 --> 00:25:02.501 align:middle line:84%
So what we then did is I said,
"Just let the pile sit there,

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.904 align:middle line:84%
and let it get bigger,
and bigger, and bigger."

00:25:04.904 --> 00:25:07.406 align:middle line:84%
So she waited 3 or 4 days and
she just had to put it away.

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:08.674 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "You see."

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.276 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well, honey, I
hadn't yet seen it yet.

00:25:10.276 --> 00:25:12.278 align:middle line:84%
I have to see the
problem and then solve it,

00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:13.946 align:middle line:90%
and then get a reward for it."

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:16.716 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, "Well, this
is really frustrating for me."

00:25:16.716 --> 00:25:19.252 align:middle line:84%
So she waited a few days,
then she said, "Oh --

00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:22.254 align:middle line:84%
" she said it in the nicest
tone of voice, asking is --

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:90%
it's an art how to ask.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.992 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Oh, John
-- " I was --

00:25:25.992 --> 00:25:27.727 align:middle line:84%
we happened to be in the
same part of the room,

00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:30.529 align:middle line:84%
"would you put your
t-shirts in the hamper?"

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.697 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Sure."

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.666 align:middle line:84%
She had no issue about
it, "You forgot again.

00:25:33.666 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
That's 3 t-shirts.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.401 align:middle line:90%
How could you wait?"

00:25:35.401 --> 00:25:37.003 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Oh, you're here.

00:25:37.003 --> 00:25:39.005 align:middle line:84%
Oh, would you put your 3
t-shirts in the hamper?"

00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:40.139 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Sure."

00:25:40.139 --> 00:25:41.474 align:middle line:90%
I put it in the hamper.

00:25:41.474 --> 00:25:42.942 align:middle line:84%
And I still remember
the response.

00:25:42.942 --> 00:25:44.744 align:middle line:90%
This is 24 years ago.

00:25:44.744 --> 00:25:48.014 align:middle line:84%
She takes a deep
breath and relaxes,

00:25:48.014 --> 00:25:50.716 align:middle line:84%
"Look how beautiful
the room looks now."

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:52.051 align:middle line:90%
And this was my experience.

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:53.185 align:middle line:90%
Men are oblivious.

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:55.054 align:middle line:84%
I looked around and
I said, "Yes.

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:56.355 align:middle line:90%
I did that."

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.457 align:middle line:84%
So now I own -- of
course she did all of it,

00:25:58.457 --> 00:26:01.994 align:middle line:84%
I just put my t-shirts away,
but I owned it as success.

00:26:01.994 --> 00:26:05.431 align:middle line:84%
Men remember those things
that create success.

00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:90%
And when they forget even that,

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:08.934 align:middle line:84%
they'll always forget
some things,

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.637 align:middle line:84%
you ask again as
if the first time.

00:26:11.637 --> 00:26:12.838 align:middle line:90%
This is the training.

00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Most women when they ask
the second or third time,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:15.775 align:middle line:90%
they're so mad at you.

00:26:15.775 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And most women have given
up asking and they walk

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.812 align:middle line:84%
around going, "I have
to do it all myself.

00:26:19.812 --> 00:26:21.347 align:middle line:90%
I have to do it all myself."

00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:22.748 align:middle line:90%
Then they feel resentment.

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:25.918 align:middle line:84%
And anytime you ask a man to do
something with a tone of voice

00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:29.155 align:middle line:84%
of resentment, you will create
a resistance in him rather

00:26:29.155 --> 00:26:32.425 align:middle line:84%
than a memory and a desire
to please and support.

00:26:32.425 --> 00:26:34.627 align:middle line:84%
And yes, does that mean
he doesn't love you

00:26:34.627 --> 00:26:36.395 align:middle line:84%
if he doesn't desire to
support, it means he's

00:26:36.395 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
in his defensive mode.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.834 align:middle line:84%
We all get in defensive modes,
not just men, also women.

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:43.202 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
that defensive mode,

00:26:43.202 --> 00:26:46.038 align:middle line:84%
we get kind of stubborn
and passive-aggressive,

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and -- or we just forget.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.577 align:middle line:84%
So the art is to constantly open
the door to invite him through,

00:26:51.577 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
if you're a woman, and
for a man the art is

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.116 align:middle line:84%
to consistently understand
the little things

00:26:57.116 --> 00:26:59.418 align:middle line:84%
that make women happy
and continue to persist,

00:26:59.418 --> 00:27:02.088 align:middle line:84%
and leaning in and
providing these little things

00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:04.523 align:middle line:90%
that make the big difference.

00:27:04.523 --> 00:27:05.758 align:middle line:90%
>> L: Yes.

00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:07.626 align:middle line:84%
Last advice for people that
are into a relationship

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:12.298 align:middle line:84%
that is just not good for
them, there is really some big,

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:13.899 align:middle line:90%
big challenges in there.

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:16.836 align:middle line:84%
How do we get out
of a relationship

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:90%
that just no longer works,

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:22.074 align:middle line:84%
and where the other person
would be manipulative,

00:27:22.074 --> 00:27:25.411 align:middle line:90%
or just really hold us back?

00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:26.946 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: To get out
of a relationship

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:30.416 align:middle line:84%
that really shouldn't happen;
certain concepts I deal with,

00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:35.821 align:middle line:84%
and the first step is what I
suggest to people is find a book

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and that helps describe
your relationship

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.292 align:middle line:84%
so you can see how
you're contributing

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:42.261 align:middle line:84%
or not contributing
to the problem.

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:43.629 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
thing I see is --

00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:46.532 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen thousands of
couples and they always come

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:48.801 align:middle line:84%
in -- I'm kind of like the
last exit before divorce,

00:27:48.801 --> 00:27:51.337 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they've got
the papers in their hand.

00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:52.972 align:middle line:84%
And I always let
the partner know

00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:55.608 align:middle line:84%
who wants the divorce
most I point

00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:58.677 align:middle line:84%
out to them how they're
responsible for the problem.

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:01.814 align:middle line:84%
Most people do not see they're
responsible for the problem.

00:28:01.814 --> 00:28:04.049 align:middle line:84%
Most people feel they're in
a dysfunctional relationship

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:05.718 align:middle line:84%
and they have nothing
to do with it.

00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:06.485 align:middle line:90%
"That's not my fault.

00:28:06.485 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it."

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.622 align:middle line:84%
They don't see how
they contribute.

00:28:09.622 --> 00:28:13.025 align:middle line:84%
And not that every
couple I help --

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's best
they get a divorce,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:84%
and that's when a person's not
mature enough to make changes.

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:20.299 align:middle line:84%
But with changes often people
really don't have a choice

00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:22.134 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's
giving them an option,

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:23.903 align:middle line:90%
like people who have addictions.

00:28:23.903 --> 00:28:25.571 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I always
tell couples,

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:27.673 align:middle line:84%
"If your partner's having an
addiction, they need to go

00:28:27.673 --> 00:28:28.774 align:middle line:90%
to get addiction help.

00:28:28.774 --> 00:28:30.476 align:middle line:84%
That's not something
you can do, and you need

00:28:30.476 --> 00:28:32.211 align:middle line:90%
to set a boundary for that."

00:28:32.211 --> 00:28:34.446 align:middle line:84%
So learning to set those
boundaries is really important.

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:37.049 align:middle line:84%
And often you need the
support of other people.

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:38.918 align:middle line:84%
You need somebody to
help you to do that.

00:28:38.918 --> 00:28:41.287 align:middle line:84%
But in my experience
most people who feel

00:28:41.287 --> 00:28:43.255 align:middle line:84%
like their problem
is dysfunctional,

00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:45.224 align:middle line:84%
they don't understand
how they created a

00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:46.992 align:middle line:90%
dysfunctional relationship.

00:28:46.992 --> 00:28:49.028 align:middle line:84%
Because really what it takes
is a lot of little things

00:28:49.028 --> 00:28:52.097 align:middle line:84%
that build up until you have
irreconcilable differences

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:53.766 align:middle line:90%
and bad behavior.

00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:56.068 align:middle line:84%
For example, if women
could understand, you know,

00:28:56.068 --> 00:28:58.204 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing counseling
for couples

00:28:58.204 --> 00:28:59.638 align:middle line:84%
where one's been
violent or something.

00:28:59.638 --> 00:29:01.907 align:middle line:84%
It's not always the man,
sometimes the woman.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:05.444 align:middle line:84%
So but I let them see that yes,
you're a victim of violence,

00:29:05.444 --> 00:29:07.213 align:middle line:90%
but you contributed to it.

00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:09.548 align:middle line:84%
And it's a hard thing to
point out to somebody because,

00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:10.916 align:middle line:84%
"Then does that mean
it's my fault?"

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.151 align:middle line:90%
"No; it's not your fault.

00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:14.353 align:middle line:84%
If a person is violent, they
should never be violent.

00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:17.389 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you do that
justifies their violence.

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:20.459 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time if you
behave in a certain way,

00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:22.328 align:middle line:84%
you bring out the
worst of your partner."

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:25.264 align:middle line:84%
And the great news there is
if you see how you behave

00:29:25.264 --> 00:29:27.833 align:middle line:84%
or interact to bring out
the worst in someone,

00:29:27.833 --> 00:29:30.502 align:middle line:84%
then you can realize that
if I shift that behavior,

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:32.538 align:middle line:84%
I can bring out the
best in them.

00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:34.607 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, that's -- I
don't readily push people

00:29:34.607 --> 00:29:37.476 align:middle line:84%
into divorce, but the clear
thing is when you are there,

00:29:37.476 --> 00:29:39.245 align:middle line:84%
make sure that you have the
support of other people,

00:29:39.245 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:90%
otherwise you tend to go back.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.315 align:middle line:84%
>> L: How about for
this manipulative mind

00:29:43.315 --> 00:29:46.752 align:middle line:84%
or if we feel we're with
somebody that is manipulative

00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:49.855 align:middle line:84%
and that we have done some
things that we shouldn't have;

00:29:49.855 --> 00:29:53.058 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like we should
have enough self-respect too

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:54.193 align:middle line:90%
to accept or not, right,

00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:55.961 align:middle line:84%
so we create this
reality in this couple.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.063 align:middle line:84%
>> JG: By not having a
boundary; you create a reality

00:29:58.063 --> 00:29:59.465 align:middle line:84%
by not being able
to set a boundary.

00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:00.799 align:middle line:84%
Here is the irony of
what you're saying.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:84%
When I do my weekend workshops,
I have the men and women

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.505 align:middle line:84%
in different rooms, and we
list out all the complaints.

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:10.276 align:middle line:84%
The number top 3 for men and
top 3 for women when we get it

00:30:10.276 --> 00:30:13.913 align:middle line:84%
down to each group is, "My
partner's too controlling."

00:30:13.913 --> 00:30:16.348 align:middle line:84%
There's always controlling
men and controlling women.

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:17.816 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
controlling partner,

00:30:17.816 --> 00:30:19.685 align:middle line:84%
usually you're the person
who doesn't know how

00:30:19.685 --> 00:30:21.987 align:middle line:84%
to set boundaries or
ask for what you want.

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:24.256 align:middle line:84%
And be tough, but
in a loving way.

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:26.058 align:middle line:84%
You can be tough
in a loving way.

00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:27.393 align:middle line:90%
Just because somebody walks

00:30:27.393 --> 00:30:29.895 align:middle line:84%
over your boundaries
doesn't mean they can't learn

00:30:29.895 --> 00:30:31.964 align:middle line:84%
to set a boundary -- I mean,
to respect your boundary.

00:30:31.964 --> 00:30:35.334 align:middle line:84%
You have to first respect
yourself and learn how to do it

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:37.169 align:middle line:84%
so you feel like
I'm a good person

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.338 align:middle line:90%
at the same time I'm saying no.

00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:41.073 align:middle line:90%
And that's a challenge to that.

00:30:41.073 --> 00:30:43.409 align:middle line:84%
Here's a little example of how
I did it in my relationship.

00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:46.145 align:middle line:84%
One of the aspects I teach
about men and women is

00:30:46.145 --> 00:30:48.013 align:middle line:90%
that we have a need for space.

00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Men tend to feel a greater
need for space, distance,

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.384 align:middle line:90%
because it's only in distance

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that we rebuild our
testosterone.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.222 align:middle line:84%
And men need to rebuild a lot
more testosterone than women

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.857 align:middle line:90%
to be happy and healthy.

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:00.392 align:middle line:84%
So I had spent the whole
weekend with Bonnie.

00:31:00.392 --> 00:31:02.528 align:middle line:84%
We were helping move her
aunt up to where we lived

00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:05.731 align:middle line:84%
in Northern California to help
her because she was getting old.

00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:07.766 align:middle line:84%
And we spent like 4 days
packing up her place

00:31:07.766 --> 00:31:09.335 align:middle line:84%
and doing the whole
thing together.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:12.171 align:middle line:84%
And when we got back up
exhausted and tired I said

00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:14.807 align:middle line:84%
to my wife, "I'm going to go
out with the guys tonight."

00:31:14.807 --> 00:31:17.176 align:middle line:84%
And she went, "Oh, but we
haven't had any time together."

00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:18.978 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was able to
translate that into,

00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
"We haven't had any
quality time together."

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.015 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I couldn't
give her quality time.

00:31:23.015 --> 00:31:27.219 align:middle line:84%
I needed to take time away from
all that to be with my buddies,

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:29.221 align:middle line:84%
and I said to her, "I
just needed time to be

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:30.089 align:middle line:90%
with my friend tonight.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go to the movies.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow I'm going to
do something very special.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.628 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to plan a dinner,
we're going to go out on a date

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.197 align:middle line:84%
and I'll surprise
you what it is."

00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:39.865 align:middle line:90%
And she was not happy with that.

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:41.967 align:middle line:84%
She looked at me with
great disapproval.

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:43.502 align:middle line:90%
And I had to stand my ground

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:46.405 align:middle line:84%
and also assure her
everything was going to be okay.

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:48.574 align:middle line:84%
If I was one of these wimpy
guys who don't understand

00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:50.476 align:middle line:84%
that you have to take care
of your own self as well

00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:53.145 align:middle line:84%
as your partner -- it's a
balance, he would have looked

00:31:53.145 --> 00:31:55.414 align:middle line:84%
at those disapproving
eyes and said, "Okay.

00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:56.815 align:middle line:90%
I'll stay home tonight."

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:59.084 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I said I'd stay
home tonight there wouldn't be

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.919 align:middle line:84%
any quality intimacy
because I needed

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:03.956 align:middle line:84%
to find myself again
as a separate entity.

00:32:03.956 --> 00:32:05.958 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some women are
saying, "Well, what about her?

00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:09.161 align:middle line:84%
She also needs to find
herself as a separate entity."

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:11.997 align:middle line:84%
And usually it's the women
who tend to have the wisdom

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:13.966 align:middle line:84%
of how much time we
should spend together,

00:32:13.966 --> 00:32:15.067 align:middle line:90%
and men have the wisdom

00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:16.902 align:middle line:84%
of saying we should
have some time apart.

00:32:16.902 --> 00:32:20.372 align:middle line:84%
So oxytocin, the hormone
that lowers stress for women,

00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:23.575 align:middle line:84%
is the hormonal bonding, and
togetherness, and sharing.

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:26.779 align:middle line:84%
Testosterone is what creates
passion, but it's distance.

00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:30.049 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about like even
in sex, you know, when I'm away

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:32.518 align:middle line:84%
for a while, boy, the
sex is so much better

00:32:32.518 --> 00:32:35.721 align:middle line:84%
because I've had a chance
to rebuild my testosterone.

00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:37.689 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, with all
this great information

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:39.758 align:middle line:84%
about psychology that I've
helped so many couples

00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:43.195 align:middle line:84%
in the world with, now for the
last 10 years I've been focusing

00:32:43.195 --> 00:32:47.066 align:middle line:84%
on, "And you have to take
into consideration the body,"

00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:48.867 align:middle line:84%
because you could be doing
all the right things,

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:52.171 align:middle line:84%
but because the food we
eat today is nutritionally

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:55.908 align:middle line:84%
deficient, because the
pesticides affect the body

00:32:55.908 --> 00:32:59.144 align:middle line:84%
like estrogen, soy
could affect the body

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and suppress the
testosterone levels in men,

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different things that
we're being exposed to now

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.552 align:middle line:84%
that historically we've
never been exposed to,

00:33:06.552 --> 00:33:08.454 align:middle line:90%
are messing with our hormones.

00:33:08.454 --> 00:33:10.989 align:middle line:84%
And for some women the easy
answer symptomatic relief is,

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.559 align:middle line:84%
"Go get hormones," which
sometimes is very helpful,

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:15.494 align:middle line:84%
but you're not treating
the cause.

00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:18.864 align:middle line:84%
We want to get back to how to
actually create healthy hormones

00:33:18.864 --> 00:33:21.233 align:middle line:84%
and understand that by
looking at our diet,

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.068 align:middle line:84%
looking at our exercise,
for women,

00:33:23.068 --> 00:33:25.771 align:middle line:84%
making sure that you're
doing like yoga classes.

00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:27.606 align:middle line:84%
It's so -- like that's
a great thing.

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:30.209 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you love to
do, good quality music,

00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:32.211 align:middle line:84%
relaxation time,
these are things

00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:34.113 align:middle line:90%
that will stimulate oxytocin.

00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:37.783 align:middle line:84%
On a nutritional level,
basically we just have

00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:39.284 align:middle line:84%
to realize we have
to supplement.

00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:41.019 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, I
help so many people,

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:43.889 align:middle line:84%
but if they don't supplement,
these things they kind of go

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:45.591 align:middle line:84%
through them and
they forget them.

00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:48.093 align:middle line:84%
Because when a woman is
stressed, she tends to think

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:49.962 align:middle line:84%
of everybody else
and not herself.

00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:53.332 align:middle line:84%
Her needs get to the -- it's
like a never-ending to do list.

00:33:53.332 --> 00:33:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And her needs are at the
bottom of the list instead

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.468 align:middle line:90%
of the top of the list.

00:33:56.468 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
She has to find that
balance in her life.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.241 align:middle line:84%
So there's great
supplements that I talk about.

00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, one is -- like
one of the big elephants

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.514 align:middle line:84%
in the room is the ultimate
stress-reducing supplement is

00:34:08.514 --> 00:34:10.682 align:middle line:90%
lithium, low doses of lithium.

00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:90%
And everybody associates lithium

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:16.421 align:middle line:84%
with schizophrenia,
bipolar and so forth.

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:17.823 align:middle line:84%
And yet we all --
it's just a mineral

00:34:17.823 --> 00:34:19.791 align:middle line:90%
like calcium and magnesium.

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But when doctors give
it, they give a form

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:84%
of lithium called
"lithium carbonate."

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.296 align:middle line:84%
And that -- for it
to be effective,

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.099 align:middle line:84%
you have to give
really high doses.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:30.302 align:middle line:84%
And for those high doses
there's a toxic side effect.

00:34:30.302 --> 00:34:32.237 align:middle line:84%
So the only -- you know,
they have to be regulated,

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:33.472 align:middle line:90%
a doctor has to look at it.

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
But actually over the
counter is lithium orotate.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:37.976 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple mineral.

00:34:37.976 --> 00:34:40.179 align:middle line:84%
It's like a 3-month
supply for $14.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.747 align:middle line:90%
It's very inexpensive.

00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:44.048 align:middle line:84%
And it regulates stress
by making serotonin,

00:34:44.048 --> 00:34:48.019 align:middle line:84%
the number one risk factor
for women today, and stress --

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.655 align:middle line:84%
in balancing work life,
balancing all of that is stress,

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:53.124 align:middle line:84%
and serotonin will
help lower that stress.

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.927 align:middle line:84%
And it's just simply
take a little, you know,

00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.093 align:middle line:90%
maybe 10 milligrams

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to 20 milligrams a day
of lithium orotate.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.466 align:middle line:84%
Natural pathetic doctors
are now being turned onto it

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.634 align:middle line:90%
and understanding it more.

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:04.069 align:middle line:90%
It's available online.

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:06.672 align:middle line:84%
It's such an easy
solution for people.

00:35:06.672 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
the only solution.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.374 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we need D vitamins.

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:11.443 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize when
we're under stress,

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:12.878 align:middle line:90%
we don't make hydrochloric acid,

00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:15.347 align:middle line:84%
which means we can't
fully digest our protein

00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:16.982 align:middle line:90%
to make dopamine and serotonin.

00:35:16.982 --> 00:35:19.084 align:middle line:84%
These are the feel
good grain chemicals.

00:35:19.084 --> 00:35:21.253 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have enough
hydrochloric acid we can't

00:35:21.253 --> 00:35:23.222 align:middle line:84%
extract B vitamins,
which are necessary

00:35:23.222 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%
for that process to take place.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.491 align:middle line:84%
If we're eating too
much vegetable

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:29.461 align:middle line:84%
and not enough omega 3, we don't
have the omega 3's necessary

00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.097 align:middle line:84%
to make the brain
chemicals of happiness.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:34.299 align:middle line:84%
So we need easy-to-digest
proteins,

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:36.335 align:middle line:84%
and we need omega
3 supplementation,

00:35:36.335 --> 00:35:39.304 align:middle line:84%
we need B vitamins, and
most important we need the

00:35:39.304 --> 00:35:41.139 align:middle line:90%
orotate minerals.

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:44.409 align:middle line:84%
Now, oratic [phonetic] acid is
a form of B vitamin as well.

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:46.411 align:middle line:84%
It bonds with lithium,
carries it

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.882 align:middle line:84%
across the blood brain
barrier, and I've had --

00:35:49.882 --> 00:35:51.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm the biggest proponent of it.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.518 align:middle line:84%
For the last 12 years
I've had thousands --

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:55.354 align:middle line:84%
tens of thousands
people visit my website,

00:35:55.354 --> 00:35:56.722 align:middle line:84%
it's our number 1
selling product

00:35:56.722 --> 00:35:59.258 align:middle line:84%
because people notice
something right away.

00:35:59.258 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like
another supplement.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.528 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of good supplements
that combat with stress,

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.264 align:middle line:84%
like althianine [assumed
spelling] will help calm you.

00:36:05.264 --> 00:36:06.465 align:middle line:90%
That's what's in green tea.

00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:08.800 align:middle line:84%
You can also just get
straight althianine.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.269 align:middle line:90%
But you feel a little altered,

00:36:10.269 --> 00:36:11.770 align:middle line:84%
like a drug alters
you a little bit.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.207 align:middle line:84%
It's not -- but when you take
mineral supplementation you just

00:36:15.207 --> 00:36:16.441 align:middle line:90%
feel more like you.

00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:20.012 align:middle line:84%
You feel clear, you feel
precise, you feel balanced.

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:21.847 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I was just
talking with someone today who's

00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:23.882 align:middle line:84%
like a master of
positive thinking.

00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:26.385 align:middle line:84%
And I pointed out that, you
know, people who are masters

00:36:26.385 --> 00:36:29.187 align:middle line:84%
of positive thinking often do
that because they're really kind

00:36:29.187 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of battling all the
time the demon

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.691 align:middle line:90%
of depression inside of them.

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:34.559 align:middle line:84%
They're kind of like always
having to think positive

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.395 align:middle line:90%
so they don't feel bad.

00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:39.131 align:middle line:84%
And when you're always
using positive thinking,

00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:41.366 align:middle line:84%
which really is a
genius state --

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:44.503 align:middle line:84%
all geniuses in history had
a tendency to have bipolar.

00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:46.705 align:middle line:84%
You know, they became
alcoholics and drug addicts,

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and Mozart would go
up and then crash down

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.343 align:middle line:84%
and have dysfunctional habits
and so forth, and addictions;

00:36:51.343 --> 00:36:54.479 align:middle line:84%
because a genius brain
needs more nutrition.

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:56.782 align:middle line:84%
And if you run out of nutrition,
you become the opposite

00:36:56.782 --> 00:36:58.784 align:middle line:90%
of genius, which is addicted.

00:36:58.784 --> 00:37:00.686 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get
the right nutrition --

00:37:00.686 --> 00:37:03.789 align:middle line:84%
and what I found that most
people don't know like Utah,

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:06.525 align:middle line:84%
there's 1 out of 3 women
on antidepressants.

00:37:06.525 --> 00:37:10.195 align:middle line:84%
Now, in all of America, 1 out
of 5 women on antidepressants.

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:11.296 align:middle line:90%
Now, why would this be?

00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:12.731 align:middle line:84%
Well, a big part of
it is women are trying

00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:15.467 align:middle line:90%
so hard to be positive.

00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:16.802 align:middle line:84%
You know, Utah I've
never seen --

00:37:16.802 --> 00:37:20.372 align:middle line:84%
in the Mormon religion there's
such a network of society,

00:37:20.372 --> 00:37:21.573 align:middle line:90%
and nurturing, and support.

00:37:21.573 --> 00:37:22.708 align:middle line:90%
It just feels so good.

00:37:22.708 --> 00:37:23.909 align:middle line:84%
You know, how could all
these people who are

00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:26.678 align:middle line:84%
so positive need
antidepressants?

00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:29.314 align:middle line:84%
And I figured it out,
which is that in order

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:33.051 align:middle line:84%
to generate positive energy,
you have to think positive.

00:37:33.051 --> 00:37:36.555 align:middle line:84%
Making positive energy actually
has a biological component

00:37:36.555 --> 00:37:38.256 align:middle line:90%
to it, which is serotonin.

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:41.093 align:middle line:84%
So very quickly you're using
up all of the ingredients

00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:43.628 align:middle line:84%
to make serotonin, and
then you crash down

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.564 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have the
nutrients you need.

00:37:45.564 --> 00:37:47.833 align:middle line:84%
Just like a genius,
like a racecar,

00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:49.568 align:middle line:90%
it runs out of fuel faster.

00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:52.003 align:middle line:84%
We have to replenish our
bodies with that genius.

00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:54.373 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a conundrum
for people who are doing

00:37:54.373 --> 00:37:55.707 align:middle line:90%
so good in their lives.

00:37:55.707 --> 00:37:58.744 align:middle line:84%
And the thing we see with
married couples is that a woman

00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:03.749 align:middle line:84%
after marriage has a high --
on average gains 9 to 10 pounds

00:38:03.749 --> 00:38:04.616 align:middle line:90%
after getting married.

00:38:04.616 --> 00:38:05.751 align:middle line:90%
And what is that about?

00:38:05.751 --> 00:38:07.018 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know weight
gain is always

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.954 align:middle line:84%
about elevated stress
levels in your body,

00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:11.123 align:middle line:84%
because when your stress
goes up, you can't burn fat

00:38:11.123 --> 00:38:13.191 align:middle line:84%
for energy so you can't really
lose weight very easily,

00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:14.593 align:middle line:90%
you gain weight.

00:38:14.593 --> 00:38:17.295 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so much stress
that first year of marriage,

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:21.099 align:middle line:84%
because marriage for many
women is a peak experience.

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:23.835 align:middle line:90%
Being in love is genius.

00:38:23.835 --> 00:38:27.506 align:middle line:84%
That's the new genius of this
new world we're creating.

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:31.076 align:middle line:84%
To sustain love, and
passion, and great sex,

00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:32.811 align:middle line:84%
these are all genius
capabilities

00:38:32.811 --> 00:38:35.046 align:middle line:84%
that previous generations
did not have.

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:38.183 align:middle line:84%
So to truly be in love,
unconditional love and giving

00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:39.584 align:middle line:90%
like that, the genius state

00:38:39.584 --> 00:38:43.321 align:middle line:84%
that depletes us very quickly
are these nutrients and minerals

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.891 align:middle line:84%
that are no longer available
in the foods that we eat.

00:38:45.891 --> 00:38:48.727 align:middle line:84%
Now, it used to be there
in certain concentrations,

00:38:48.727 --> 00:38:51.797 align:middle line:84%
but once we started using
fertilizers a hundred years ago,

00:38:51.797 --> 00:38:54.332 align:middle line:84%
not only did the plants
not get the minerals,

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:56.435 align:middle line:84%
but it actually has
now depleted the soil.

00:38:56.435 --> 00:38:59.538 align:middle line:84%
So the minerals really aren't
available for people to get.

00:38:59.538 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is all -- fortunately
there's supplementation.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.709 align:middle line:84%
You know, lots of companies have
great mineral supplementation

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.111 align:middle line:90%
that trace minerals.

00:39:06.111 --> 00:39:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But the best minerals I found
-- I call them "super minerals,"

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.049 align:middle line:84%
is when they're bonded
to oratic acid.

00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.118 align:middle line:84%
A famous German doctor
figured that one out.

00:39:13.118 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was just helping
everybody

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.488 align:middle line:90%
with the lithium orotate,

00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
the magnesium orotate,
the zinc orotate.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.625 align:middle line:90%
For example, the average male

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:23.528 align:middle line:84%
at 50 years old has half the
testosterone levels he had

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:90%
when he was younger.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:30.068 align:middle line:84%
I'm 61 years old, and I have
25% higher testosterone levels.

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:31.169 align:middle line:90%
And I know how I did it.

00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:32.671 align:middle line:90%
I have zinc supplementation,

00:39:32.671 --> 00:39:34.573 align:middle line:84%
I also in the beginning
took a few herbs.

00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:36.007 align:middle line:84%
An herb called "toncotali"
[phonetic],

00:39:36.007 --> 00:39:39.945 align:middle line:84%
from Bangkok will increase
a man's testosterone 400%,

00:39:39.945 --> 00:39:41.780 align:middle line:90%
without giving testosterone.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.316 align:middle line:84%
You see, when men take
testosterone it's a steroid.

00:39:44.316 --> 00:39:45.317 align:middle line:90%
It breaks down his body.

00:39:45.317 --> 00:39:47.085 align:middle line:90%
It's not good at all.

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:48.954 align:middle line:84%
And everybody knows
it's not good, but hey,

00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:51.189 align:middle line:84%
if it works, they're
okay with it.

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:54.025 align:middle line:84%
There are so many easier ways
to do it that are all natural,

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:57.462 align:middle line:84%
zinc supplementation, super
food shakes, you know,

00:39:57.462 --> 00:40:00.599 align:middle line:84%
it will help your body to then
make that what you're missing;

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:02.367 align:middle line:90%
because the body's miraculous.

00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:04.503 align:middle line:84%
It's just like our
hearts are miraculous.

00:40:04.503 --> 00:40:05.937 align:middle line:90%
We have to just feed it.

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> L: Yes; and we have to
support it so it's able to love

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.176 align:middle line:84%
and have wild sex and
have great fun, right?

00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:12.244 align:middle line:90%
>> JG: Yes.

00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:13.879 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just telling
you that there's --

00:40:13.879 --> 00:40:16.414 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you learn how
to master opening your heart

00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:17.883 align:middle line:84%
with your partner
and sustain that,

00:40:17.883 --> 00:40:19.918 align:middle line:90%
sex is great for a lifetime.

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to the
ire Veda [phonetic],

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.022 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient Chinese medicine
and look at all the herbs

00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:27.592 align:middle line:84%
for great sex, they're the
same herbs for longevity.

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:28.293 align:middle line:90%
>> L: Hmm.

00:40:28.293 --> 00:40:29.594 align:middle line:90%
So that will be part 2.

00:40:29.594 --> 00:40:32.497 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs] No; there's plenty
of videos on John's site

00:40:32.497 --> 00:40:36.301 align:middle line:84%
if you want to check it out,
marsvenus.com; beautiful site.

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:38.904 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
this awesome conversation.

00:40:38.904 --> 00:40:40.205 align:middle line:90%
>> JG: It's a real pleasure.

00:40:40.205 --> 00:40:43.475 align:middle line:84%
>> L: [Laughs] And thank you
to all beautiful listeners

00:40:43.475 --> 00:40:47.078 align:middle line:84%
and viewers, and I hope you
have enjoyed this conversation.

00:40:47.078 --> 00:40:47.979 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:40:47.979 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Big, big kiss, San Diego.
