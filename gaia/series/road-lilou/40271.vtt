00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my
juicy co creators,

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.215 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:15.349 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the road.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.885 align:middle line:84%
I'm in London, England
for another interview.

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:21.088 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
interview that usually, well,

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.389 align:middle line:90%
I can't really say that.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:23.824 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say it's
a different interview

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.092 align:middle line:90%
than others, but no.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:30.164 align:middle line:84%
You made a conscious profound
shift in your existence

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:33.467 align:middle line:84%
in your life to be
really of contribution

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to other human beings,
and you demonstrate this

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.972 align:middle line:90%
in many many ways.

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Your background is in property
management, property business,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
but you're in system billety
and you work for large groups

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.051 align:middle line:84%
of hotels, Intercontinental
Hotels, etcetera; right?

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Lawrence Bloom: I
actually sat on the main board

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.055 align:middle line:84%
of the Intercontinental
Hotel Group, yeah.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you did
this sabbatical in '96,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.429 align:middle line:84%
and you came back to
business in 2007 I think,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.597 align:middle line:90%
or 2006; 10 years later.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.869 align:middle line:84%
But you had some profound
shift in your way of being,

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.405 align:middle line:84%
and I would love to
start this conversation

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.509 align:middle line:84%
because this is an important
conversation regarding the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
economy and this crisis,
and what really is happening

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.849 align:middle line:90%
and the damage it can create

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.918 align:middle line:84%
if we don't change
our way of being.

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:28.556 align:middle line:84%
For Gaia, Gaia is really--
it might be our worst nightmare.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:33.894 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Well, I think Gaia
sent us an intelligence test,

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.996 align:middle line:84%
and we're in the
middle of that test.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:45.072 align:middle line:84%
I think that the rewards for
being successful in this test is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.377 align:middle line:84%
that we will rediscover
interconnectedness

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:54.915 align:middle line:84%
with the earth that gives
us life, our relationship

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:59.253 align:middle line:84%
with the close mass that gave
us birth, our relationship

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:01.789 align:middle line:84%
with each other because
with each other--

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.226 align:middle line:84%
without each other our lives
have no meaning, and ultimately,

00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:09.496 align:middle line:84%
our relationship with
ourselves and in nature.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.366 align:middle line:84%
And I think the rewards
for success

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
for this intelligence test which
God has sent and will mark,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.908 align:middle line:84%
are beyond our wildness
dreams, and it will have to do

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:28.849 align:middle line:84%
with a loving, caring,
nurturing, contributing society.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.787 align:middle line:84%
But the penalties of failure
are really beyond our worst

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
nightmares because the
planet has so much capacity

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.132 align:middle line:84%
to absorb the current
rates of green house gasses

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:48.435 align:middle line:84%
that we're admitting into
the atmosphere in a way

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.805 align:middle line:84%
which sustains human
life beneficially

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.041 align:middle line:90%
so that life can thrive.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:57.678 align:middle line:84%
So I often get asked,
"Lawrence, will you speak

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:00.114 align:middle line:90%
about the earth in peril?"

00:03:00.114 --> 00:03:02.616 align:middle line:90%
And I say, "You know.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.218 align:middle line:90%
The earth is not in peril.

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:07.421 align:middle line:84%
The earth has been here four
and a half billion years.

00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.423 align:middle line:84%
It will almost certainly
be here for another four

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:11.959 align:middle line:90%
and a half billion years.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.661 align:middle line:90%
What's in peril is us.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.596 align:middle line:90%
We're the ones in peril."

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:21.969 align:middle line:84%
So we even word some
of our talks in a way

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.272 align:middle line:90%
that we don't face reality.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:27.908 align:middle line:84%
We don't face reality
of the situation,

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:32.812 align:middle line:84%
and so I'm spending
a fair amount of time

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:39.453 align:middle line:84%
in the States creating a double
bottom line model for a new form

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:47.828 align:middle line:84%
of energy company, so that model
will be-- will have a purpose.

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:51.632 align:middle line:84%
The purpose is to be
beneficial to the planet

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:56.836 align:middle line:84%
and to future generations,
and we'll look at people.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:59.006 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's the
people that we employee

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.376 align:middle line:84%
or the minor community, and
we'll make ourselves responsible

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:06.914 align:middle line:84%
for their education and their
health, and their housing

00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
because I hear a lot
about human rights, okay.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.423 align:middle line:84%
And all that I hear about human
rights has to do with democracy

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and free speech, but I
believe something more deeper.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.068 align:middle line:84%
I believe that every human
being by virtue of their birth,

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:32.172 align:middle line:84%
that's all as a human being,
has the right to clean

00:04:32.172 --> 00:04:37.945 align:middle line:84%
and fresh water, to nutritious
food, to proper shelter,

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.781 align:middle line:90%
to education, and to health;

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.016 align:middle line:84%
access to education
and to health.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:47.955 align:middle line:84%
Of course, freedom of speech,
and so on is important,

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:51.358 align:middle line:84%
but we need for everybody
on this planet

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:54.762 align:middle line:84%
to provide those
basic facilities

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:59.233 align:middle line:90%
and human requirements, so--

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I was going to say,

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:04.972 align:middle line:84%
because clearly this
initiative is about contributing

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:08.509 align:middle line:84%
and supporting the planet, and
this is what you are ambassador

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.613 align:middle line:84%
for so that other people
to take those initiatives

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:17.851 align:middle line:84%
and start doing jobs or being
in this way in their own lives

00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:21.255 align:middle line:84%
so that then naturally there's
something else that happens

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:23.457 align:middle line:84%
and occurs in our life,
and we're supporting

00:05:23.457 --> 00:05:26.226 align:middle line:84%
in a different way this need
of security is in there;

00:05:26.226 --> 00:05:28.562 align:middle line:84%
could you tell us
more about that?

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:29.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Yes.

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:30.764 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes absolutely.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.065 align:middle line:84%
I think we completely
misunderstand security

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:34.201 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:37.071 align:middle line:84%
Security has been
around force of arms

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
for so long we don't
know how to let it go.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It isn't around force
of arms anymore.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.612 align:middle line:84%
It isn't about protecting
ourselves

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:47.581 align:middle line:90%
against each other anymore.

00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:51.985 align:middle line:84%
What it's about now is coming
together as a global family

00:05:51.985 --> 00:05:54.755 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that nobody
slips through the net,

00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:58.058 align:middle line:84%
in terms of fresh
water and housing

00:05:58.058 --> 00:06:00.761 align:middle line:90%
and nutritious food, etcetera.

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:04.131 align:middle line:84%
And that we come together
as a global family to deal

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.302 align:middle line:84%
with the common challenges
of the environment

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:17.377 align:middle line:84%
and the inefficient, and I would
say illogical and greedy use

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:24.685 align:middle line:84%
of resources which
condemn future generations

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:27.654 align:middle line:90%
to lives of abject poverty.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's like we focus our
minds on the limitation of some

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:35.462 align:middle line:84%
of the resources when there is
unlimited love, unlimited light,

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:38.932 align:middle line:84%
unlimited, you know
creativity, and we focus

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:40.234 align:middle line:90%
on the lack all the time

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle line:84%
when there is an
abundance of so many things.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:45.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Well, I think
there's a balance.

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:50.244 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
balance between what--

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:59.386 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
balance between our greed

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:04.291 align:middle line:84%
and what it takes to sustain
us, so our wants and our needs.

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:08.428 align:middle line:84%
Most human needs are very basic,
and once you've got those four

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:13.901 align:middle line:84%
or five ingredients, shelter
and so on, taken care of,

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:19.806 align:middle line:84%
increase in worldly goods
doesn't necessarily bring more

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.142 align:middle line:90%
happiness and satisfaction.

00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's more depression
in developed countries

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.784 align:middle line:84%
than there is in undeveloped
countries, so the old model

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.721 align:middle line:84%
that says the more you have the
happier you are is probably very

00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:36.323 align:middle line:90%
faulty in deed.

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:41.094 align:middle line:84%
We need to see how that model
is causing us to strip the earth

00:07:41.094 --> 00:07:48.235 align:middle line:84%
of resources that are finite,
and one day we'll just run out.

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:54.141 align:middle line:84%
Top soil is a finite resource,
but we all need food to live

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
so we need to start to
address these problems

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.115 align:middle line:84%
because the catastrophic
results of not will

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:05.385 align:middle line:84%
as I say condemn our children
and maybe ourselves at the end

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:08.889 align:middle line:84%
of our lives and our
children's children to lives

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:12.693 align:middle line:84%
that are very difficult,
so I also spend, I mean,

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.628 align:middle line:90%
the power from creating a model

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
of a typical bottom
line company--

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.701 align:middle line:84%
a major one in the states
which will work in Africa

00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:26.006 align:middle line:84%
and North America and South
America, we're looking--

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:29.076 align:middle line:90%
I spent a little time in China,

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:33.647 align:middle line:84%
because China is also
overextending herself in her use

00:08:33.647 --> 00:08:42.388 align:middle line:84%
of resources, but her leadership
is open to new impulses,

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.959 align:middle line:84%
so she experimented
with communism,

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.295 align:middle line:84%
and then that worked
politically for her

00:08:48.295 --> 00:08:52.366 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't work economically;
there was a huge famine.

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:56.269 align:middle line:84%
Maybe anything up to 10
percent of Chinese starved,

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:00.407 align:middle line:84%
and Xi Jinping, the second
President when he came to power,

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:04.945 align:middle line:84%
famelessly said, "I don't care
what color the cat is as long

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:09.483 align:middle line:84%
as it catches mice, so I don't
care what system we use as long

00:09:09.483 --> 00:09:11.485 align:middle line:84%
as it leads people
out of poverty."

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:16.823 align:middle line:84%
They adopted the capitalist
model for about 15 years.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:17.891 align:middle line:90%
It's worked very well.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.328 align:middle line:84%
It's lifted 650 million
out of poverty,

00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:22.663 align:middle line:90%
but it can't lift anymore

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:25.632 align:middle line:84%
because their air is
now totally polluted.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.068 align:middle line:84%
Their rivers are
toxic; they're poison.

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle line:84%
The earth is degraded so
they need a new system.

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.273 align:middle line:90%
They need a new system.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: But part of what--

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:38.979 align:middle line:84%
it feels like a part of us
are ignorance and there's all

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:43.383 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden China a rise
in capitalism and the money

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and purchasing power, and then
there is society goes towards

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.723 align:middle line:84%
materialism, and that's
more or less where we're all

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:52.326 align:middle line:90%
at right now in so many places.

00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Not everywhere, but this is

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.229 align:middle line:84%
like if it was the most
important thing on earth

00:09:56.229 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:84%
to own more and to have more, or
have this and have that, and--

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: We have, yes.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:07.107 align:middle line:84%
It's a very excellent point, and
it's a point that I like myself,

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:11.645 align:middle line:84%
but it's easy in the Western
world not to feel challenged,

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:15.315 align:middle line:84%
but in China when you
come out of your home,

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:18.385 align:middle line:84%
and you can only see 100
meters in front of you

00:10:18.385 --> 00:10:21.922 align:middle line:84%
because the air is so poisoned
and toxic then you know you have

00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:24.891 align:middle line:90%
to make a change; in Beijing.

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:26.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Unless
you're there short term.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.929 align:middle line:84%
Unless you just see
for tomorrow,

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.997 align:middle line:84%
and you don't see the
full vision or see,

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.433 align:middle line:84%
you know what really
we're here on earth

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:36.737 align:middle line:84%
to do unless you
just want to be safe.

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:39.139 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: What I think the
leadership realizes now there's

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.907 align:middle line:84%
a serious problem, and
they're going to have

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:42.709 align:middle line:90%
to address these problems.

00:10:42.709 --> 00:10:45.812 align:middle line:84%
So Hu Jintao, who was the
previous president before the

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:51.017 align:middle line:84%
current Xi Jinping, he took
power a few months ago,

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:55.455 align:middle line:84%
spoke about we have to give
up growth, or these levels

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:59.226 align:middle line:84%
of growth and start to
focus on sustainability,

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:02.062 align:middle line:84%
and this is now
constitutionalized

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:84%
in China's constitution,
so she's one

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:05.699 align:middle line:90%
of the first countries,

00:11:05.699 --> 00:11:07.567 align:middle line:84%
certainly the first
major country,

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:84%
to make a commitment
towards sustainability

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:15.041 align:middle line:84%
and to relinquish some of
the extraordinary growth

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that she's had because she's
beginning to realize, excuse me,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.849 align:middle line:90%
that the levels of growth now

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:25.852 align:middle line:84%
and the resource
uses unsustainable.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:29.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, and it's not
about China versus America

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:32.058 align:middle line:84%
or China being stronger
as a competitor,

00:11:32.058 --> 00:11:34.761 align:middle line:84%
and this is not the level
that we need to work on.

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:39.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: No, and in
fact, I'd like to share

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:43.503 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think we're living
in an age of change anymore.

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:48.175 align:middle line:84%
I think we're living in a change
of age, and the old age was all

00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:90%
about conflict and competition.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:56.249 align:middle line:84%
It was all about scarcity and
so on, and now we have to move

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.885 align:middle line:84%
from those concepts
to collaboration;

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.187 align:middle line:90%
see how we can work together.

00:12:00.187 --> 00:12:04.291 align:middle line:84%
Look at what unites us,
not what divides us.

00:12:04.291 --> 00:12:08.395 align:middle line:84%
So we need to move to
more collaborative models

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:12.699 align:middle line:84%
where we can work together
in a harmonious culture

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to provide better lives for
ourselves and our children.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.273 align:middle line:84%
Now, better lives may not
mean five cars or three cars.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:23.476 align:middle line:84%
It may mean less--
maybe less wealth.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:32.552 align:middle line:84%
It may mean what we would
consider maybe a lower standard

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:39.092 align:middle line:84%
of living, but that would
be compensated by the joy

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:43.063 align:middle line:84%
that people get in creative
learning and collaboration,

00:12:43.063 --> 00:12:44.965 align:middle line:90%
so everywhere we need to look.

00:12:44.965 --> 00:12:51.571 align:middle line:84%
We need new models that are
more appropriate to the new age,

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle line:84%
and so, for example,
in education.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:57.944 align:middle line:84%
Education is something
we should address.

00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:02.382 align:middle line:84%
We have a situation in education
where arriving on time,

00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:06.586 align:middle line:90%
doing your lesson, and leaving

00:13:06.586 --> 00:13:10.056 align:middle line:84%
when the bell rings is
all that's important,

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:16.863 align:middle line:84%
but there have been phenomenally
successful experiments

00:13:16.863 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
with young children in
education where they work

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.837 align:middle line:84%
in different teams of different
ages where they're allowed

00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:28.875 align:middle line:84%
to explore their own passions
where they're given freedom

00:13:28.875 --> 00:13:34.881 align:middle line:84%
to work with computers to create
information with their computers

00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to help them with their
projects, so the whole structure

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.726 align:middle line:84%
of education moves from an
industrial age to a creative age

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:50.397 align:middle line:84%
because the jobs that are there
today won't be there tomorrow.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:52.232 align:middle line:90%
The skills that will be needed

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:57.137 align:middle line:84%
from the young generation are
not the skills of yesterday,

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:58.805 align:middle line:90%
they're the skills of tomorrow,

00:13:58.805 --> 00:14:02.108 align:middle line:84%
and they can develop
those skills

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:05.045 align:middle line:84%
by their own inner
journeys is ay

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:08.248 align:middle line:90%
in multitasking teams and so on.

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:13.887 align:middle line:84%
So we need to see what's
breaking through this old age

00:14:13.887 --> 00:14:18.825 align:middle line:84%
into something new and
vibrant and dynamic.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:21.661 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem that
we currently have is the

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:23.463 align:middle line:84%
financial-- I say
the biggest problem,

00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:27.968 align:middle line:84%
the environmental problem is the
biggest, so my suggestion is,

00:14:27.968 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be talking to
the Chinese about this,

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.541 align:middle line:84%
that we should be developing
a city that will specialize

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:38.611 align:middle line:84%
in disaster relief
in mitigation.

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.213 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
see the armies

00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:43.016 align:middle line:84%
of the world coming
together as a first step.

00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.752 align:middle line:84%
Maybe with a small
amount of each of their--

00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:48.621 align:middle line:84%
like the United Nations
Emergency Force,

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:57.697 align:middle line:84%
The Blue Berets, to
create a rapid relief force

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:02.402 align:middle line:84%
for disaster relief, so they
could use their logistical

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:06.473 align:middle line:84%
capacities, their engineering
capacities for disasters,

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:10.744 align:middle line:84%
and then build up on that
small beginning to see armies

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and the military working
together more and more

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.549 align:middle line:84%
as I believe disaster
relief will become more

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:19.019 align:middle line:90%
and more important.

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:21.621 align:middle line:84%
We're already at some
dangerous tipping points

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.689 align:middle line:90%
with the environment.

00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:28.161 align:middle line:84%
We know that 350 parts
per million of CO2

00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.297 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere would start--

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.099 align:middle line:84%
anything in excess
of that would start

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:38.605 align:middle line:84%
to trigger an almost
uncontrollable rise

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.273 align:middle line:90%
in temperatures.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And we're
not even talking

00:15:42.008 --> 00:15:44.911 align:middle line:84%
of all the electromagnetic
and all the different things

00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're-- that lobbies
are completely, you know,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.417 align:middle line:84%
putting aside, and we're
not even seeing the danger

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:51.518 align:middle line:90%
of all of that.

00:15:51.518 --> 00:15:52.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Exactly, exactly.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:54.788 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So this is
disastrous for our health,

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:56.723 align:middle line:90%
for our well being, for, I mean,

00:15:56.723 --> 00:15:59.492 align:middle line:84%
look at Fukushima even how
things have been handled;

00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:00.794 align:middle line:90%
it's everywhere.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:04.097 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes we feel
really stressed and in doubt

00:16:04.097 --> 00:16:07.834 align:middle line:84%
of how humanity is going to move
forward and that other times,

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:10.804 align:middle line:84%
you know; it's about
moving forward as in step

00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:14.941 align:middle line:84%
by step taking those actions
with the right values behind it.

00:16:14.941 --> 00:16:17.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Exactly, exactly.

00:16:17.777 --> 00:16:20.847 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
the good news is

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:25.151 align:middle line:84%
that the Chinese say may you
live in interesting times.

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:30.123 align:middle line:84%
It's a curse, but we
live in interesting times

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
because they're challenging,
very challenging, but I believe

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.229 align:middle line:84%
that in many ways
they're a blessing

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:41.935 align:middle line:84%
because it's this very shadow,
our own shadow, which is wanting

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.304 align:middle line:84%
to hold on to the past
which is not wanting

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:49.676 align:middle line:84%
to evolve will be the
very trigger that helps us

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.778 align:middle line:84%
to take the next
evolutionary step.

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.648 align:middle line:84%
So I don't, you know, I hear
a lot conspiracy theories.

00:16:55.648 --> 00:16:56.816 align:middle line:90%
Many of them I agree with.

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:58.618 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure they're true.

00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:00.954 align:middle line:84%
I think you would be foolish
not to realize that true

00:17:00.954 --> 00:17:03.423 align:middle line:84%
when you see how events are
playing out on the world stage,

00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:06.091 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think
it's a bad thing.

00:17:06.091 --> 00:17:09.294 align:middle line:84%
I think it's difficult,
but I don't think it's bad

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:11.164 align:middle line:84%
because I think there
comes a time

00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:13.867 align:middle line:84%
when normal people
say it's enough now.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.735 align:middle line:90%
I need to take responsibility.

00:17:15.735 --> 00:17:17.137 align:middle line:90%
I need to do something about it.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:20.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So the question
how much do we need to react?

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Yeah, and each
one will have a different

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:24.077 align:middle line:90%
boiling point.

00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:29.849 align:middle line:84%
Some of us were in the late
80s beginning to realize hey,

00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:30.917 align:middle line:84%
there's something
not right here.

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:33.486 align:middle line:90%
We need to be doing something.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:36.623 align:middle line:84%
This will be very
late to realize

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:42.595 align:middle line:84%
that there's a real problem
that we need to address,

00:17:42.595 --> 00:17:46.533 align:middle line:84%
but that's why, if I may
say, to use like yours

00:17:46.533 --> 00:17:51.437 align:middle line:84%
and your viewers
are really important

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:55.408 align:middle line:84%
because these are ripples
that go out into the field,

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:59.846 align:middle line:84%
and so I have a belief,
it's a personal belief.

00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:03.316 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove it, but
I think it thinks me.

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:07.353 align:middle line:84%
I think the field thinks me, and
I have a radio antenna that kind

00:18:07.353 --> 00:18:09.522 align:middle line:84%
of picks up these thoughts,
and I call them my thoughts,

00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:12.025 align:middle line:84%
but actually, they're just kind
of floating around up there,

00:18:12.025 --> 00:18:15.628 align:middle line:84%
and I can like a lightning
conductor bring them

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:16.863 align:middle line:90%
down to earth.

00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:84%
The reason your viewers
are so important

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.034 align:middle line:90%
and what you're doing is

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.837 align:middle line:84%
so important is you
actually impact the field.

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:29.309 align:middle line:84%
You actually make a difference
on how the world thinks,

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:32.145 align:middle line:90%
and so the more people that join

00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:37.717 align:middle line:84%
and watch the more the old
pyridine starts to dissolve,

00:18:37.717 --> 00:18:39.519 align:middle line:90%
and the chance for the new

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:47.193 align:middle line:84%
to emerge becomes much more
obvious, much more effective.

00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you can,
by the way, you know,

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:52.966 align:middle line:84%
there is underneath those videos
on Gaiam TV there is comments,

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.267 align:middle line:90%
so if you want to comment

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:57.103 align:middle line:84%
and even say what your
own initiatives has been

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:58.538 align:middle line:90%
in this regard, you know,

00:18:58.538 --> 00:19:02.942 align:middle line:84%
let's get the conversation
also open and take care.

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:04.811 align:middle line:90%
I love testimonies.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.412 align:middle line:90%
I mean I feel there is as many--

00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:08.348 align:middle line:84%
there's so many people
trying to be on this planet.

00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:11.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean we all have
unique talents and beauty.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: That's
one of your viewers.

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:15.021 align:middle line:84%
Every one of your viewers
has their own story

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:16.856 align:middle line:90%
and their own moment of truth

00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:19.259 align:middle line:84%
of what made them
suddenly realizes hey.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:21.261 align:middle line:84%
This isn't working
I need to change.

00:19:21.261 --> 00:19:23.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yours was at a moment

00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:25.031 align:middle line:84%
where you were driving
your Mercedes.

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:26.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Mine was at the moment

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:29.569 align:middle line:84%
where I finally achieved
what I'd set out to achieve,

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:90%
the big house, the big car.

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:35.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting outside the big
house and thinking is that it?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:36.709 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:41.214 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that actually
there's a part of us

00:19:41.214 --> 00:19:44.751 align:middle line:84%
that isn't nourished by
money and acquisition,

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:49.689 align:middle line:84%
but it's nourished by something
much deeper, and that deeper is

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.825 align:middle line:84%
when we contribute, and
that contribution comes

00:19:52.825 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
from what I call right action,
but actually, it's contribution.

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:01.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So contribution
and letting go

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:90%
of the need of security?

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:07.273 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: I think you have to
let go; if I could quote a poem?

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:08.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: I went to
India in the late 90s,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.081 align:middle line:84%
and I was with the clergy
and this Kundalini girl,

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:19.152 align:middle line:84%
and I was interested in the
energy of the Kundalini,

00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:22.989 align:middle line:84%
and after about ten days I
couldn't stop writing poetry,

00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:26.926 align:middle line:84%
but I'd just like to share the
first verse of the first poem

00:20:26.926 --> 00:20:29.929 align:middle line:84%
that I ever wrote, because it
was always good instruction

00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:33.066 align:middle line:84%
for me, but may be
of value to you too.

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:37.303 align:middle line:90%
And it starts, "First you have

00:20:37.303 --> 00:20:44.143 align:middle line:84%
to let go only then can
you truly surrender.

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:47.947 align:middle line:90%
Only then can you truly trust

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:53.252 align:middle line:84%
and only then can
you truly have faith.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:57.924 align:middle line:84%
And when you have faith
you can enter the gateway,

00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:03.196 align:middle line:84%
and when you enter the
gateway you stop living life

00:21:03.196 --> 00:21:09.469 align:middle line:84%
and life starts living
you, and then you dance

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:12.839 align:middle line:84%
because there's nothing
there to do."

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love this.

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:15.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: It's about letting go.

00:21:15.375 --> 00:21:16.209 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: It's about letting be.

00:21:17.443 --> 00:21:20.913 align:middle line:84%
It's about joyously
contributing.

00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:23.449 align:middle line:90%
Who is it at your street,

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.819 align:middle line:84%
in your neighborhood,
that needs some help?

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:31.591 align:middle line:84%
Just help and you'll
find that whatever you do

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:34.761 align:middle line:84%
out there comes back
a thousand times.

00:21:34.761 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
There's a dynamic see.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:84%
A very good friend of mine is Ed
Mitchell; Ed was the sixth man

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:53.112 align:middle line:84%
to walk on the moon, and Ed
had an ecstatic experience

00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.982 align:middle line:90%
on the way back from the moon.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:22:01.921 align:middle line:84%
He had what the Indian culture
calls sun culpa Samadhi;

00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:08.895 align:middle line:84%
it's a peak experience, and
he was the Lunar Module pilot

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:11.898 align:middle line:84%
which meant that on the way back
from the moon he had no work

00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:84%
to do, and so he's
in the command module

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:17.637 align:middle line:84%
with the other two astronauts,
but he was just looking

00:22:17.637 --> 00:22:21.874 align:middle line:84%
out of the porthole, and he said
he saw the radiance of the earth

00:22:21.874 --> 00:22:25.845 align:middle line:84%
and the stars, the moon,
much brighter obviously

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.747 align:middle line:90%
than we see them on earth.

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:31.284 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden he realized
that the atoms that made

00:22:31.284 --> 00:22:36.289 align:middle line:84%
up his body were born in
the heat of the oldest stars

00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:39.225 align:middle line:84%
that were ever created,
and now this is his body.

00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:43.129 align:middle line:84%
So he realized that his body
didn't end with his skin,

00:22:43.129 --> 00:22:48.768 align:middle line:84%
it's just a perception that
actually he was everywhere

00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:56.209 align:middle line:84%
and just focused on the
piece that was Ed Mitchell,

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:59.679 align:middle line:84%
but Ed Mitchell was
a universal being.

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:05.418 align:middle line:84%
And that realization bought
him to a state of real ecstasy,

00:23:05.418 --> 00:23:08.654 align:middle line:84%
and this is the secret he
writes about in his book.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:13.359 align:middle line:84%
But what's important to realize
is that if we are all one

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:17.697 align:middle line:84%
that any kindness we do to
another we do to ourselves,

00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:22.168 align:middle line:84%
and any evil that we do to
another we do to ourselves,

00:23:22.168 --> 00:23:26.439 align:middle line:84%
so why would we want to
do badness to anybody?

00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:30.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Isn't he the one
that also started the IONS?

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Yes, exactly right.

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:34.213 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he started the
Institute of Noetic Sciences

00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:36.148 align:middle line:90%
because he was a scientist.

00:23:36.148 --> 00:23:41.821 align:middle line:84%
This guy was the best
flight test pilot,

00:23:41.821 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's why he was
able to join NASA.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:50.296 align:middle line:84%
So you-- nothing fluffy about a
test pilot and a chief engineer,

00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.399 align:middle line:84%
and so he wanted to understand
the scientific, and of course,

00:23:53.399 --> 00:23:56.702 align:middle line:84%
the institute is still at
the forefront of looking

00:23:56.702 --> 00:24:00.106 align:middle line:90%
into these kinds of experiences,

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:03.242 align:middle line:84%
and looking into
how the mind works.

00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:04.644 align:middle line:90%
How the mind works.

00:24:04.644 --> 00:24:09.415 align:middle line:84%
What role it plays, you know, in
development and in our growth.

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:11.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We're so
interconnected; I love it.

00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:12.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Yeah, totally.

00:24:12.652 --> 00:24:14.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love when we
have those conversations

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:84%
because those are really to me
the conversations worth having

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.191 align:middle line:90%
and that makes us feel good,

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:84%
but not only just feel good
is totally seeing the world

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.596 align:middle line:90%
from another angle.

00:24:23.596 --> 00:24:26.832 align:middle line:84%
I remember when my heart
reopens after letting go

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:28.267 align:middle line:90%
of the job and the money.

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:31.337 align:middle line:84%
It felt like, oh my god I'm
going to relive this experience

00:24:31.337 --> 00:24:34.473 align:middle line:84%
and just meet again everybody
that I had met in my life.

00:24:34.473 --> 00:24:35.575 align:middle line:90%
I feel I'm going to see them

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:38.044 align:middle line:84%
in a total different
light, and there it was.

00:24:38.044 --> 00:24:39.712 align:middle line:90%
It's a shift.

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:41.647 align:middle line:90%
It's a pyridine shift.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:44.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Yeah, it's
a huge pyridine shift.

00:24:44.417 --> 00:24:46.852 align:middle line:84%
There have been two
interesting books recently,

00:24:46.852 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
one by Eben Alexander,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.757 align:middle line:84%
who I understand
Lilou has interviewed,

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:56.262 align:middle line:84%
the other by a lovely
woman, Anita Moorjani.

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:58.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Whom I've also
interviewed many times.

00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:00.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Well, she
is fabulous too,

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:04.003 align:middle line:84%
and you know we're always
learning, and something she said

00:25:04.003 --> 00:25:08.641 align:middle line:84%
at an event she held in London a
few weeks ago I thought I would

00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:13.312 align:middle line:84%
have guessed it ages ago, but
I really hadn't got it totally.

00:25:13.312 --> 00:25:17.049 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "You know
we're all victims."

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:20.353 align:middle line:84%
So her father always
tried to get her married

00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:25.458 align:middle line:84%
to a nice Indian boy, but she
didn't want to get married to.

00:25:25.458 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Her book is actually
called "Dying to be Me"

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:84%
which is a great title,
but she said when she went

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.668 align:middle line:84%
to the other realm after
she had clinically died,

00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:38.437 align:middle line:84%
she felt extraordinary
unconditional love

00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:41.607 align:middle line:84%
from her father, and she
realized that he was a victim

00:25:41.607 --> 00:25:45.778 align:middle line:84%
of his own upbringing,
and so we're very locked

00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:47.279 align:middle line:90%
into these are the perpetrators.

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.948 align:middle line:90%
These are the evil guys.

00:25:48.948 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
These are the bad guys.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.951 align:middle line:90%
But you know.

00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:54.587 align:middle line:84%
They grew up with a point
of view because of the life

00:25:54.587 --> 00:25:56.622 align:middle line:84%
that they led because
of the hardships

00:25:56.622 --> 00:25:59.258 align:middle line:84%
or other things that
they endured.

00:25:59.258 --> 00:26:04.864 align:middle line:84%
I'm not excusing evil behavior,
but I am saying we should look

00:26:04.864 --> 00:26:07.667 align:middle line:84%
at everybody as if
they are victims

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
of their own genetic stream
and upbringing, and you may not

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:20.312 align:middle line:84%
like them, but at some
level, you could love them,

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:24.517 align:middle line:84%
because you see their own
pain in the way they behave.

00:26:24.517 --> 00:26:26.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, hence this
whole ho'oponopono

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and everything else related

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.891 align:middle line:84%
to that bringing
compassion and forgiveness.

00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:33.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Yeah, again.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:35.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You practiced all
that, this is so interesting.

00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:39.765 align:middle line:84%
>> Bloom: Yeah, because I
believe there are two doors

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:44.036 align:middle line:84%
that enable you to get
out of this earth prison.

00:26:44.036 --> 00:26:48.441 align:middle line:84%
I want to say prison, I
mean, prison in your mind,

00:26:48.441 --> 00:26:55.481 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a prison, and those
two doors are called gratitude

00:26:55.481 --> 00:27:00.586 align:middle line:84%
and forgiveness, and if you can
practice just being grateful

00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:07.827 align:middle line:84%
to breathe and grateful to see,
or grateful to hear or to feel,

00:27:07.827 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and feel grateful, and if you
have the capacity to forgive,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:23.375 align:middle line:84%
those two capacities,
those two lenses to which

00:27:25.945 --> 00:27:32.818 align:middle line:84%
to view the world will make
your journey so much easier.

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So much more valuable,
so much more lovely.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:43.729 align:middle line:84%
Sinicism and hatred are not
good foods for the soul.

00:27:43.729 --> 00:27:48.901 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude and forgiveness
are real nourishment,

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:51.370 align:middle line:90%
real nourishment.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.506 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you
for those wise

00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:55.975 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful words
coming from the heart.

00:27:55.975 --> 00:27:58.744 align:middle line:84%
I have a last little question
regarding your little red

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:00.079 align:middle line:90%
bracelet right there.

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:02.581 align:middle line:90%
>> Bloom: Ah, yes.

00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:09.822 align:middle line:84%
Okay a number of different
cultures, Buddhism is one.

00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Judaism is another.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:18.597 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism is another; have sting
which has been in a holy place

00:28:18.597 --> 00:28:22.535 align:middle line:84%
