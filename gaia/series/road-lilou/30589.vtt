00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Hello, beautiful co-creators!

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Lilou, here.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.310 align:middle line:90%
This is for Gaiam TV.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm with a Marie
Diamond in Monaco.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Here we are.
-Yes.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.761 align:middle line:10%
And wonderful to be with
you and with Gaiam TV.

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:10%
Wonderful.
Yeah.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to speak of
the law of attraction, quantum

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
physics, Feng Shui-- all those
amazing things that we want

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to, probably a lot
of us-- at least I

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.905 align:middle line:84%
want to personally
integrate that in my life,

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to use those wonderful tools.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
You were one of the featured
teachers in then "The Secret."

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You probably have
seen that movie.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And seven other documentaries.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
From what I heard,
you're an author,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:84%
you travel the world, and
your-- your this expert.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.841 align:middle line:84%
You've been fascinated by this
topic for quite awhile, huh?

00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I've been fascinated
with the law of attraction

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:84%
actually since I was
seven, but really,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:90%
very focused since I was 15.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.884 align:middle line:84%
So it's already
quite a few years.

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
What did you meant, back then,
about the law of attraction?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Had you heard of
it or it's later

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%
on that you pinpointed it?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
No, it was actually--
I met a spiritual mentor

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.470 align:middle line:90%
when I was seven.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Early on, right?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt I wanted
to contribute to the world.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
then you need to learn

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
about the law of attraction.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
first time I heard

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
the-- the experience and the
words, law of attraction.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.061 align:middle line:84%
And explained me how to do the
law of attraction at seven.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:90%
In Belgium?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you were in
Belgium back then.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
In Belgium.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I
was a young child.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, how do I do that?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.397 align:middle line:90%
He said, what do you want?

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:43.029 align:middle line:84%
That was his first question.
What do you want?

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I said, I want a happy home.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, my home was not very
happy, there was a lot of--

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Unhappy parents?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, conflicts between
the family, and parents,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:90%
and my older siblings.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was the
time of the 1968, 1969.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
So everybody was in
generation conflict.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
have a happy family.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, why
don't you start

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:90%
making beautiful drawings?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And draw, over, and over, and
over again, what you want.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
children do, right?

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:90%
They're drawing.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They're making
vision boards, right?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And so he gave me five colors
to work with because he said,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
well, colors give a
certain vibration.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had to start
working with rose,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
aqua blue, yellow,
citrus green, and violet.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:90%
And so I had my five markers.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was always creating
a beautiful, happy home.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And a home with the
rainbows and hearts.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really feel the
difference really at first,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.751 align:middle line:84%
but then when I was nine,
something really major

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
My oldest brother actually
left the home, without consent

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%
getting married.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.341 align:middle line:84%
At the time, you had to still
have consent of the parents,

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I was very unhappy
that my brother just left.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So I start drawing,
over and over

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
again, that he would be with
us at the Christmas dinner.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And that we would
actually-- he would

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:90%
shake hands with my father.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was like for-- for months,
I was drawing this every day.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was visualizing, right?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I was focusing on it.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But there was no reaction
until just before Christmas.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I got a letter him with
five lollies, right?

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
To ear.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were exactly in these
five colors I was drawing.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
And I thought like, oh my god.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Something is working, you know?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I knew his address
because he gave me his address.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.197 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote him a
letter and said,

00:03:32.197 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I want you to come
for Christmas dinner,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
but come first to shake
hands with your-- our Father.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And actually, I gave him a date.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
He came.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And we had the most wonderful
Christmas dinner ever.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.165 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
first, real experience

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
of focusing, creating almost
a daily visual of what

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I really wanted as a child.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.313 align:middle line:84%
And from that day
on, I was hooked.

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Hm.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So how did you
later on-- because

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
from my understanding
you were a lawyer.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So how did you go from
that-- from learning

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that you're
a co-creator to going into law?

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Law of vibrations, no?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, one of the
things that my spiritual mentor

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
said to me, that I
needed to understand

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
how, collectively, the law
of attraction is working.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Because as humanity, as a group
of people in every country,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
we are doing the law
of attraction, too.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Not individually,
but collectively.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And based on that collective
law of attraction,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:90%
we put things in paper.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the law that we're
creating is actually,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:90%
I would say, a visual.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a constant reminder.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we are
programming ourselves

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
through our physical laws and
the legal laws, of course.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he-- each time I
actually went to study,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
then he came and he
explained me kind of

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
how the cosmic laws were
working with the human laws.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned a
lot about leadership

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
through becoming a lawyer.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And the first five
years as a lawyer,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I start working
with the government

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
in Europe and Belgium.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And understanding how trying
to change people's mind

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps create different
laws-- because laws

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:84%
are just an expression
of the mindset

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
of a-- a community in a way.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And so try to bring positive
energy to the leaders

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:90%
of my country and of society.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And after five years, I
said, well, it's nice,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:90%
but I have other things to do.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So I became a teacher of the
law of attraction, of Feng Shui,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and meditation.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And universal laws.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:90%
And universal laws, but--

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:90%
How do you-- what are those?

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the
first law that I always

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:90%
work with is the law of love.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the first one.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I always say law, l-a-w,
actually is the same as love.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.782 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's a different
way to say things.

00:05:48.782 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think the first
step is always like,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:90%
do you love yourself?

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you love others?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you love the planet?

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.911 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the major
law that I always work with.

00:05:57.911 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's hard
to do anything,

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
if we don't have that,
is it-- isn't it?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
If you do not have
that intention of love,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
then it's-- people speak a
lot about having passion.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But I said, that's great,
but if you don't have love,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
then I don't think you
can even have passion.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first law
that I always work with.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
second law, for me,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:90%
is always-- is the law of light.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
The law of lightness, and to
try to be light in your life,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and show light
through your eyes,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and-- and be the
light for others.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you have
love, you also-- it's easier

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
to be light, and to
be lighter, and not

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.554 align:middle line:90%
get into the density of life.

00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And so all the things--

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It can get dense, yes.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.689 align:middle line:84%
It does.
It does.

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
I've always focused on,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
is to create enlightenment.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Because enlightenment
means I'm in the light.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm all the time in the light.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always look for
systems, energy systems

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that lighten up people's
lives, and their mind,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and their hearts, so that
they would be able to be

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
more loving to each other.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
the law of attraction

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
always is really
important about it.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you
focus on the light,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
if you focus on the
love, then things will

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:90%
really come beautifully to you.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to be really precise
with the law of attraction?

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Or is it more important
that there is that love,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and that light, and
that trust, and then

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
things, according to that
and that high level, come?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say
it's a mix, I think.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
I think you're being how
you are in the morning.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:90%
You know, you wake up.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like the first
thing is, have

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%
the intention of being loving.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Have the intention of being
light for yourself, for others,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
your community, your
colleagues, you know,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:90%
your family, your friends.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But then it's also
important to be precise.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like, where do you
want to be loving towards?

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Who do you want to
be loving towards?

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe, I
always say, it's a little bit

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.390 align:middle line:90%
of a mathematician in a way.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, he wants preciseness.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%
He wants a certain order.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I believe
we need to have goals.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:90%
And I always say the word goal.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, we look at the word
goal and it actually says,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:90%
go-al.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:90%
You know, go all the way.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But connecting with
the all-- connecting

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with all the light, and all
the love, and all the greatness

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:90%
that you can be.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And so don't limit yourself,
but be precise in saying,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:90%
I want all.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, I want
all the happiness,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I want all the
greatness, and the wealth

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:90%
that I can bring forward.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
But not just for yourself.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
I believe the law of attraction
is not a selfish law.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a law of impact.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen-- if you
focus on how much people

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
you want to impact with your
talents and your skills--

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you
had that idea, too.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
You were not just doing
this for yourself,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:90%
you know, bringing this forward.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And I actually made that
decision when I was 15.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
After a near death
experience, I woke up

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what
I am here to do?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with saying,
I'm here to enlighten

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%
more than 500 million people.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to bring light to
more than 500 million people.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:90%
500 million?

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
because of that focus at 15

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up in "The
Secret" because-- and I'm

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
with you right now and
I'm with all of you.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is my
every morning focus.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
-Oh, so you have affirmations?
-Yes.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I have an affirmation and--
but when I do the affirmation,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't say like, oh, you
know, oh, I'm connecting

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
which 500 million people.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.675 align:middle line:84%
It's first feeling the love
for 500 million people.

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
-Mm.
-Yeah.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other level.
Yes.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.249 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other level.
Yeah.

00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And everyone I met is one
of these 500 million people.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Why 500 million?

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that just came as a
number to me at that time.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And I've been trusting that.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know, for
example, "The Secret,"

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and other documentaries,
and all the work

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I do is actually
because every morning,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I feel and love
500 million people.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know this 500 million
people have at least four

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.131 align:middle line:84%
or five people
around them, right?

00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So, well, perhaps I'm
already connecting with 2.5

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:90%
billion people around them.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I really try
to just be focused.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And the pure, pure
intention of the law

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:84%
of attraction, the love
of attraction, I think

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.970 align:middle line:90%
is a major deal for me.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So you-- you are, um--
do you picture it already?

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Are you already living
it and then it comes?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Or is that still as a future--
-No.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a living.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I think we start always
with a visualization

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
because we start first, trying
to see it outside of us.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But it, ultimately, needs
to be a real be-- living it.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Not believing it,
but be living it.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%
To really live that part.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I wake up, I
just, in meditation, I

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
connecting with 500
million people and beyond.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, I say now and beyond
because, through "The Secret,"

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I have, perhaps, reached
already so much people.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
That's already a check,
right, on the checklist.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But, um-- it's--
it's-- you know,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the things, when
I put a number on it,

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I always say, and beyond.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like to
infinity and beyond.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
You know, in the movies.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So really-- but feeling
it that I'm connecting

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.614 align:middle line:90%
with 500 million people.

00:11:29.614 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's very crowded in the
morning in my meditation,

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I would say.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- it's just
being that, living it.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it means that every
action you take, every thought

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that comes, every feeling,
every step I take on my journey,

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm focusing on that.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And it can be being interviewed.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, you reach
a few million people.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going to
being in the elevator,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and always having a
smile on your face,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and having the
light in your eyes,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and saying a little
hi to these people.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about
the big numbers.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It's every day,
everyone you meet.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Because then you know that
everybody that you meet--

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:90%
they are those--

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:90%
They are those.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They're part of it.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, you cannot say, I'll
only take these ones, right?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:90%
It's everyone you meet.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's one of
these things that happens.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, you know,
we're in Monaco

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and two years ago, I had this
very interesting experience.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly had this very
intense pain in my belly.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was like-- so
I went to the doctor.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, OK,
you have a really--

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:90%
something needs to be operated.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, hm, OK.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had like, two
days later, a very

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
important presentation with
some people here in Monaco.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I have
two days to recover.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:84%
If you have an operation
tomorrow, you have a week.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, this is not
in my law of attraction,

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:90%
but if it is, then so it be.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, perhaps I need to
meet the doctors and the nurses.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that's part
of my 500 million people.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.890 align:middle line:90%
And so I did my meditation.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And I did exactly what
the doctor's suggested

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
me-- the antibiotics and so on.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And-- but a woman came next to
me in another bed in the room.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:90%
A two bedroom room.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.931 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I said to her, well,
she's one of my 500 million

00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:90%
that I'm reaching.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And every day, I'm radiating
my light to these 500 million

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:90%
people and you're one of them.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought like,
well, she's one of them.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, tell
me about your life.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I'm
very anxious that I'm here.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- thank god,
I'm not in your bed

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:84%
because my dear friend, her
name is Marie-- and I was like,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:90%
oh, my name is Marie, too.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, she died in this bed.
-Oh.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And I took care of her.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought
me to this, you know,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
hospital room and I'm so
happy I'm not in that bedroom.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what did
your friend always say?

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, she always said
to me, if there is one day you

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
could to meet a Feng Shui
master, that would be just

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
so amazing for you to know.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
learn The Secret.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, I'm
here now, and she's dead,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and how can I meet
that Feng Shui master,

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and how can I meet,
you know, The Secret?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I'm Marie Diamond.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Feng Shui, perhaps the
only one right now in Monaco,

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
and I'm part of The Secret.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh my god.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.032 align:middle line:84%
And so we took the whole
night to talk and to let-- you

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
know, bring her light
back and-- and connect

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:90%
her back with her love.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
my pain was gone.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said,
c'est impossible.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Because it was all gone.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I was just here to
connect with one of the people

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:90%
of the 500 million.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if you always understand
that if you have this focus

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
that everyone you connect with
is the one that you, perhaps,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:84%
need to bring love
and light to, then--

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.101 align:middle line:84%
so that was a wonderful
story just in Monaco.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed, having practiced
myself the law of attraction,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.251 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes we think, oh
my goodness, now it's over.

00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's done.
It's too late.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
How do you actually-- and
I'm thinking of an interview

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I did with Wayne Dyer on Maui.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
this-- this is

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
not going to happen now because
time is really running out.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, what
do you recommend

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
when there is those things
where you think, oh, no.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
This is-- now it's
not going to happen.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not working.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I always say,
you know, we do

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
not the agenda of the universe.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So I try to kind
of match my agenda

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
with the universal agenda
and the agenda of god

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:90%
that I don't know.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when something is not
happening, I'm like, OK, well

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:90%
there's another plan right now.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Or I have to meet, perhaps,
someone else right now.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.365 align:middle line:84%
Or there's another
purpose right now.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So I-- I try not to go
into the drama of it.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
really big thing--

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
is try to keep it light and
say, well, perhaps this is

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
just time to relax right now.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, in my agenda,
this is relax time.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And-- or it's time
for reflection.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Or it's time to, perhaps,
focus more on what

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I really want to accomplish.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I had things not happening.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, many things.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like
another door opened

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and then some amazing things
were happening beyond that.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I couldn't have
figured that one out, right?

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So if I would have taken
that door or that pathway,

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
great, but, apparently,

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:90%
there was something else.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So I always go in
a complete trust.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned
to be in trust.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I have been practicing
this for a while, right?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.034 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes there's doubt.

00:16:39.034 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
like, I don't know.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Just go back in the trust
and go back to your focus.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.630 align:middle line:84%
What are you here for?
What is your love?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:90%
What is your light?

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And then-- and try to do steps.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not sitting there
meditating the whole day,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- I am a mother,
I am a business woman,

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm a consultant.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:90%
So I-- I move forward.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't stop because
something is not happening.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
What I have noticed, with
Wayne Dyer for example--

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would
happen on the beach.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But I still-- I said,
OK, it's all good.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything is good as it is.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, 10 minutes later,
I receive a text message.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, an hour
later, at his place.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that's
what we need to do.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Is not getting into the
drama, and the doubt,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
and the fear of
it's not happening.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:90%
And just saying, well, accept.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's,
perhaps, another plan.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And then that other
plan can unfold.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you go in fear,
and if you go in doubt,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and if you go in
really, you know,

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.221 align:middle line:84%
the drama of it, then what
will unfold is more drama.

00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, you just
say, OK, I come into that place

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:90%
of zen, of energy, of silence.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And like, OK, I accept
there's, perhaps, another road.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And then the road can unfold.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But the road cannot
unfold, if you're going

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:84%
into the drama
because then you open

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:90%
a whole other door right there.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's all a
matter of energy then

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and how we're feeling
every step of the way?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much the events?
-Yeah.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
holding the frequency,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.310 align:middle line:90%
holding the vibration.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sometimes things
are happening and beyond then

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.470 align:middle line:90%
what you can actually imagine.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I like.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's things
sometimes-- you know,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I started-- when I moved to
America about 10 years ago,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:90%
you know, I had no clue.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, any one of the people
in "The Secret," for example,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I did not know of
their existence.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know the
self help industry.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I was just a meditation and
Feng Shui master from Belgium,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
right, that just got the inner
call, moved to California.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was so interesting
because I made my vision board.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And I put on my
vision board, I'm

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be in a movie seen by
hundreds of millions of people

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:90%
that will transform the world.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought like,
oh, I don't know how.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, I thought like,
I'm close Hollywood.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.632 align:middle line:84%
Could be an actress, could
be a producer, or a director,

00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
or-- I never thought it
would be as myself, right?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I bought myself a
fake Oscar statue, right?

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And I put a label on
it, Marie Diamond.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And I put in 2006
because I figure somehow,

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll only need a
few years, right?

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Like four years.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually the next
day after I made this,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I already met one
person that's also

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.741 align:middle line:84%
in "The Secret," Marcy Shimoff.
-Mm hm.

00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Great.
-And, um-- and so she unfolded.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Opened up address books
because she became a friend,

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and a student, and a client.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I
ended up in the kitchen

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:90%
of Jack Canfield, right?

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And-- and so he
brought me into the TLC

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of "The
Secret" was filmed.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And-- and so it's just
because I put the focus up.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of looked
at my Oscar every day.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, come on, Oscar.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I kind of, you know,
fantasized about it.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But the funny part
of it, it was--

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I was focusing on that
movie, but because I had

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
my Oscar, within a
few months, I had

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:90%
my first Oscar winning client.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So that Oscar, you
know, traveled with me.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years
ago, it was really

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
interesting-- I thought I had
this one Oscar statue, right?

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
what if-- and all

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
my clients I met
so far in Hollywood

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
had like one Oscar nomination
or one Oscar statue.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
what are the people

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that have won three Oscars?
Right?

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So then I said, well,
why don't I do that.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So I bought myself
three Oscar statues.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I actually
put them there

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and every day I was
like connecting with it.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And a week later, I get a
phone call from someone.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, I
want you-- you know,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:84%
you're invited to come and
do a consultation for someone

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in Hollywood, but we don't
want to mention the name.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, wow, that's really
difficult for me, you know?

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
you're referred

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.710 align:middle line:90%
by this and this person.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, I-- it'll be OK.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up in the
bedroom of someone

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
with three Oscars statues.
-Oh, my.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said to this person--
I said, when did you call me?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.455 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well-- she said,
well, we already knew about you

00:21:05.455 --> 00:21:10.110 align:middle line:84%
for four years, but only last
week, Tuesday, we thought,

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:90%
we need Marie in our home.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was a day I put my
three Oscars statues out.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It was like saying
to the universe--

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:84%
-Mm hm.
-I give permission.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.461 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for that
vibration, you know?

00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was really fun
thing to see that happening.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
There were people
that also attract

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.371 align:middle line:84%
things or keep on attracting
things that they don't want.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-What's your advice?

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
that I teach people

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is that there are three parts
of the law of attraction.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
The first part is what we call
your spiritual connection,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
your heavenly luck.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what we have
attracted from childhood on.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And it can be things
connect with your ancestors.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Like perhaps your mother and
father, or your community,

00:21:54.010 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
or your family, or your culture
has created collective patterns

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and love attractions.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you, perhaps, are
vibrating on that fields.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And you, as you
were born into it,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:84%
you kind of were
given this, I would

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
say pattern and frequency.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:90%
And you just accepted it.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And you kept, you know,
connecting with it all the way.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:90%
So we say that's about 33.3%.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes call it the
karma or the destiny.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I say, sometimes it can even be
from previous life experiences,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
previous life forms that you are
still attracting something in.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that's far
going for many people,

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
but if I say that's the
whole package you had,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
can you change that?

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Through prayer, and
through meditation,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and through forgiveness
you can definitely

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:90%
release that package.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's a package that we
have not so much control over.

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Then we have what we call
in the law of attraction

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
the human law of
attraction that most people

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:84%
in the secret, for example, and
in self help are working with.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's how you
think, how you feel,

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and how you act in life,
how you handle things.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Chinese
law of attraction,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Feng Shui masters are
saying, this is another 33%.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not 100%.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not because you think
about it that it will happen.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:84%
If your spiritual law is
saying something else,

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
if your ancestors have given
you a different message,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.380 align:middle line:84%
these messages will
clash with each other.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And so you can think about it.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's not because you have the
million dollar on your ceiling

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
that it just will
happen because you

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:90%
think about it all the time.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It's possible you have
a deep rooted fear

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:84%
of money, for
example, that has been

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:90%
given through your parents.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But there's another third
of the law of attraction

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that I actually always
wanted to bring into people.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- we call it the
environmental, the earth luck.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually what
the Feng Shui masters and

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:90%
the dowsers are talking about.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It's that you environment,
your home, your office

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:90%
has a frequency of its own.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we're living in
a home 24 hours a day,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:84%
or our office eight hours a
day, and it says that everything

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
that is around you is actually
affecting what's inside of you

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because we are programmed
95% subconsciously.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the
patterns of our parents,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and our family, and our culture.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:90%
It's everything you see.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sitting at
a desk, and perhaps you

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:84%
can do that right now or
wherever you're sitting,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and you are looking
up, what do you see?

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
What is the image
you're seeing there?

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Now that image, even if
you don't look at it,

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
gives you, subconsciously,
a vibration.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you want romance,
and you're just surrounded

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
by single women or men, and
you're walking everywhere

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in your home into that field,
you're subconsciously saying,

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to be single.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I love to be single.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Even if you do not want
to be single, right?

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that Feng
Shui and dowsing is really

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.340 align:middle line:84%
part of uplifting, and making
the environment lighter,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and giving it the
right message to what

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:90%
you really truly believe.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I put
my vision board up,

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.200 align:middle line:84%
don't hang it in your kitchen
or on your fridge, right?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But hang it where
you see it every day.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:90%
My Oscar statues were out there.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now they were not--
you know, I found

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.260 align:middle line:84%
some Oscar statues actually
in a bathroom by some people.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then their career
went down, right?

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.651 align:middle line:84%
So where--
-Down the hole.

00:25:23.651 --> 00:25:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Down the drain.
-Down the drain, right?

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about what you
want to surrounded with.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Like some people say,
well, you have to surround

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:90%
yourself with the right people.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Or who do you have coffee with?

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's right, but who
do you surround with in images?

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:90%
In colors?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:84%
If you don't color your
life, how can you-- you know,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't color your home,
how can your life be colorful?

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're, you know,
not coloring your body

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and don't make
yourself nice, how can

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:90%
you feel, inside of yourself?

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
But also, that's what
Feng Shui is, actually.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:02.111 align:middle line:84%
I would call it the quantum
physics of your environment.

00:26:02.111 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I added
to the law of attraction

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
how things work around you.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I thought
about in "The Secret."

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's because
of that that I was part

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
of "The Secret"
because nobody else

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:90%
was talking about that aspect.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, what are the images
that are around you?

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And so many people say,
I saw you telling this

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and I was like-- look
in their bedroom.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh my god!

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's all
pictures of me.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:90%
So who do I make love with?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Who am I in love with?

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.879 align:middle line:84%
Me?
Great.

00:26:33.879 --> 00:26:35.181 align:middle line:84%
But someone else, too, I hope.
-Yeah.

00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Is there space?

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there--
-Is there space for it, right?

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.890 align:middle line:90%
So dowsing.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't often speak about that.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.331 align:middle line:84%
You do, great.
-I do.

00:26:44.331 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Great.
It's courageous.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.799 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:46.799 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have many, many thousands
of students worldwide.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Business people and, you know,
people all over the world

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that are really
working with dowsing.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:84%
As I was really
focusing on environment,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I also started understanding
how the quantum physics field

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:90%
of the earth is influencing us.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that all the frequencies
of what is happening

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:84%
in the earth-- the fault lines,
the water that is running under

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:90%
is-- does affect us.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I created a whole
system, Diamond Dowsing,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.620 align:middle line:84%
where we actually
are finding what

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
we call the break points in our
law of attraction of our home.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so people are sometimes
not sleeping very well

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:90%
or they have conflicts.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I come into their
bedroom, or their office,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:90%
or their restaurant.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:90%
And so we cure it.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly,
their thoughts

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.930 align:middle line:84%
started changing, their
feelings started changing,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
their health is
improving because there's

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
not such a pressure anymore
that is pulling down.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Because dowsing really
creates a law of lightness.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And your-- the whole air,
the whole feeling of a home

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:90%
actually completely changes.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was just yesterday,
coming over here,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.010 align:middle line:90%
I was opening a magazine.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a very important
restaurant in Brussels.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And he-- you know, he was a
client of mine many years ago.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And his restaurant has
just been completely down.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
He had actually moved some
things in his restaurant.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.981 align:middle line:84%
And he had a Michelin
Star, two Michelin Stars.

00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
-Wow.
-And he lost them in one year.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And he called me and said,
there's something wrong.

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, but
what did you do?

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And-- and so I changed things
around and now he's-- you know,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
he has a Michelin Star again.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it
was so interesting

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
how he moved things around.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, I didn't like
it, but I couldn't

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
feel what it was until I really
looked at the dowsing level.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was standing
all the time,

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
welcoming people on a place
where his conscious experience

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.400 align:middle line:90%
was actually really low.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
He became very pulled
down, he became depressed.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And as he then, you know,
was in a better place,

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:90%
he started being uplifted again.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So it is a very
important part of what

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.775 align:middle line:84%
I do in the law of attraction,
uplifting the home,

00:29:05.775 --> 00:29:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and the office, and the company
for a whole other level.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And people just
feel it right away.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.351 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing-- an
amazing part of it.

00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-How does it work, the dowsing?

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.220 align:middle line:90%
You hold two sticks?

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:84%
We have two dowsing sticks
and we have dowsing cures.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I always say it's a
kind of acupuncture.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:90%
An acupuncture of your home.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like when the
chi doesn't work,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:84%
when the flow doesn't
work in your body,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.540 align:middle line:90%
you put a little needle, right?

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Or a little pressure.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the same thing.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.750 align:middle line:90%
There are places in your home.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And most people know it.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.304 align:middle line:90%
Like, they don't like that area.

00:29:35.304 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Or they don't want to sit there.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.720 align:middle line:84%
If we sit there,
we get very tired.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Or they're getting
dis-concentrated.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when you-- when you put
the things there, they're like,

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:45.350 align:middle line:90%
feels uplifted.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And I always say to people, look
where the children like to play

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.760 align:middle line:84%
in your home because
the children,

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.010 align:middle line:84%
they always know exactly
where the best energy is.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Or where the dog wants to stay.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The dog loves the
very positive energy.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But where the cat
stays, don't stay there.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The cat always feels where
the negative energy is,

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and she goes on it, and
tries to clear it for you.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but it still means
it's a negative place.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.011 align:middle line:84%
They love the beds, too, and
to put all their fur on there.

00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they are on the bed,
it's because you have problems

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:90%
in the stress line of your bed.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.441 align:middle line:84%
And I always-- when I find--
you know, I said, look,

00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that's where your
cat always sleeps.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
that's it, exactly.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So, well-- and so we cure it.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
The cat never comes
on the bed anymore

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:90%
afterwards because it's cured.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So she's like, I cannot
do anything anymore.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy is uplifted.
Yeah.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So cats are an indication
and transforming it.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, we don't
always have to ask

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:43.935 align:middle line:84%
the cats to do it, right?
-Uh huh.

00:30:43.935 --> 00:30:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So-- so you use it
through to find the-- kind

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.844 align:middle line:84%
of the negative spots?
-Yeah.

00:30:47.844 --> 00:30:49.927 align:middle line:84%
But also the positive because
you can set an intention

00:30:49.927 --> 00:30:51.459 align:middle line:84%
and find your power spot?
-Yes.

00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:52.815 align:middle line:84%
So there are also
positive places, what

00:30:52.815 --> 00:30:54.690 align:middle line:90%
you called positive vortexes.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.555 align:middle line:84%
And when, for example, you know
where the most positive law

00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
of attraction places a few home,
place there your vision board,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:84%
or place there the
images of your family,

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.160 align:middle line:90%
or place there your goals.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The energy goes faster
and your law of attraction

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
manifests actually
for 33% faster.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So we see that the
timing of manifestation

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:18.950 align:middle line:84%
shortens when you add your
environment to the picture.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.747 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that on
a quantum physic level?

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, on a quantum physic
level, what do we see?

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's that, you know, everything
is energy as we know.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And everything has a frequency.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Also your home.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that the
earth has frequencies

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:90%
that she needs to have.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, the stress
lines or the fault lines.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
That's part of what the
breakdown of the earth is.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.110 align:middle line:90%
But that also has a frequency.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but if you sleep
on such as stress line, what

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.220 align:middle line:84%
happens is your
body will attract

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:84%
exactly that stress line
in your mind, in your body.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:57.001 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an aligning
with the stress line.

00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So what we doing,
we're saying, OK,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
let's-- let's have the
earth, the stress energy,

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.250 align:middle line:90%
but let's not bring it to us.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So we actually are redirecting
that stress energy in the right

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.610 align:middle line:84%
away that nobody's
harmed anymore.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we make sure then that
the quantum field of heaven,

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, can actually
completely manifest

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:90%
in our three dimensional world.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually making the
multi-dimensional vibration

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
actually being placed
completely in a very

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
good place on this planet.
Yeah.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can-- we can cure
these places ourselves,

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.710 align:middle line:84%
even if we sit-- see our
cat on the bed or something

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
that it feels draining.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.780 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier,
all those signs.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.734 align:middle line:84%
We can do things?
-Yeah.

00:32:42.734 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what I teach
the people, you know?

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:84%
In the Diamond Dowsing,
we have virtual programs,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.500 align:middle line:84%
home study courses
where you actually

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.940 align:middle line:90%
are completely curing that.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's just amazing to see
people change, children change,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, companies doing
so much better, the flow.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's just
much more happier

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and then their law of
attraction just happens.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.437 align:middle line:90%
And so we know it.

00:33:06.437 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
When you we go in a
certain place, we're like,

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is so dense and it's
so difficult to get focused.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And then they get
easier in their focus,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and their mind is open,
their hearts are open.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's just their
quantum field of their home

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:22.981 align:middle line:84%
is the most uplifted
as possible.

00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So the dowsing would be
more something energetic,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.145 align:middle line:84%
or speaking, and
shifting, whereas the Feng

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:31.561 align:middle line:84%
Shui would be object, colors?
-Yes.

00:33:31.561 --> 00:33:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Feng Shui is really
about, first of all,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.560 align:middle line:84%
based on your personal
law of attraction.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So we look at your
personal birthday

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and then we're giving you what
is your portal off success,

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:84%
your portal of help, your
portal of relationships,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.470 align:middle line:90%
your portal of wisdom.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:84%
-It's not the bagua?
-No.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.610 align:middle line:84%
It's actually really the
compass where the compass is

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
a representation of
the quantum field

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:90%
on the three dimensional level.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:57.707 align:middle line:84%
And so based on your
birthday, you're

00:33:57.707 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:90%
sitting a certain direction.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm
sitting here now,

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.370 align:middle line:84%
but I already looked
immediately on my compass

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if it would be a good
direction for me.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting facing my
relationship direction,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.780 align:middle line:90%
what I'm really appreciating.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is that whatever
I'm doing, the flow of energy

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:13.770 align:middle line:90%
will be more accepted.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Whatever my words are, will be
more going into the universe.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're working with
that, first of all,

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
based on your personal
energy number.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
And then we're actually
placing images and colors

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:84%
on the right places
in your office,

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in your bedroom, in
your living room.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And you always try to sit a
certain direction, facing,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:84%
because your chakra
system is connecting

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.190 align:middle line:90%
with an aspect-- a portal.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I say it's a portal
to the universe.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
Like a frequency that always
is easy and effortless.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.889 align:middle line:84%
So Feng Shui makes things
easy and effortless.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that whatever
potential you have,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever talent
you have, that it's

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:90%
actually flowing all the time.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So my students and clients,
they are always-- they

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.250 align:middle line:84%
know their directions and they
have a little law of attraction

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
app on iPhone
where they can find

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:90%
their law of attraction number.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
check that out,

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and they have a little compass,
and they are-- in every place

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:84%
they are, they're like always
making sure every meeting,

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
every contract
they have to sign,

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.800 align:middle line:84%
they're always sitting
the right direction.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Or in a hotel room,
they make sure they

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
sleep the right direction
as much as possible.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And they are starting
to feel that the flow is

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.520 align:middle line:90%
so much easier.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Things just happen.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like coming into the
world and coming into America,

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I just-- things have
been easy and effortless.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't really-- I don't
really have to do so much.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
bringing it to me

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:84%
all the time because
the portal is open.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.067 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do
with your inner world.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Your inner universe
is actually stabled,

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.310 align:middle line:90%
centered, at a good vibration.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
It's both.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.341 align:middle line:84%
I think it's both
inner universe--

00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, through meditation,
and prayer, and being in light,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and being-- and loving people.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
the outer universe.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And the outer universe
needs to be aligned.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
I always say, the message
from what is within you

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:84%
needs to align with the
message outside of you.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all want things
to manifest in the world,

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:84%
but if your a first layer of
the outer universe-- your home,

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:84%
your bedroom, your office-- is
sending a different message,

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you that outer
message will actually

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:84%
win because it supports you
or not supports you for 95%

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious mind.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, well, I
want, you know, romance.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I want health.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But you have all clutter
and mess around you.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind is
getting this all the time.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And so first thing I always
say is like, you want to order,

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.900 align:middle line:84%
you want direction, but
you come in your home

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and you don't find anything.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like,
where is everything here?

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.309 align:middle line:84%
-Mm hm.
-OK.

00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:84%
How can there come a
direction in your life

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.790 align:middle line:84%
if you don't create
direction in your home.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the home outside
reflects back to the inside.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I
always say it's easier

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:84%
to sometimes work
on the outside,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.960 align:middle line:90%
not to work on the inside.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's saying, change
your bed and sleep better.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, hang a different
message, feel happier.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the inside
starts changing.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say
changing your mindset,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:84%
let's be honest,
that's sometimes

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:90%
a difficult one, right?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Or like changing your thoughts
and doing something different.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
If you wake up in the morning,
and you have slept wonderfully,

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration is
high, and you wake up,

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and you see all beautiful
colors, you cannot be anything

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:90%
else than feeling more happy.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you stand up, and you
go into the rest of your home,

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're just like, everything
is so loving because you

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.470 align:middle line:90%
have been loving yourself.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, your home
should be your love nest.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But not just the love
nest for the romance,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.480 align:middle line:84%
but they love nest for
the soul that you are.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
the-- the Feng Shui.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that was
developed by the Chinese,

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.029 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:58.029 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But then there's all
kinds of Feng Shui?

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, I really--

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:90%
They could do something wrong.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is wrong?

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, I always, well,
perhaps I was part of your plan

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:90%
at that time, right?

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a reason why
you connect with me right now.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So I really use the old
systems of Feng Shui.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually really trained
in the Eastern traditions.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, you know, every
tradition has a beauty to it.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that's what you
need exactly at that moment.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that we need to
be as personalized as possible.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you're very
unique and I'm unique.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And so my connection
with universe

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:84%
has to go-- you came in
through a very unique

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:90%
with your unique soul.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So I want to you to stay
as unique as possible.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we have seen that there
is some general things you can

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.960 align:middle line:84%
do with Feng Shui,
but as more unique

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
you are-- if you put your
vision board in your success

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.320 align:middle line:84%
direction, your personal
success direction,

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%
you have amazing more results.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you, for
example-- and something

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.911 align:middle line:84%
very general, but very important
is always try to see the door.

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-You know?

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Always tried to see--
-Yeah.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.894 align:middle line:84%
Never turn your back.
-Yeah.

00:39:09.894 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
To the door.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So always make sure that you're
sitting as a queen or a king.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.224 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a desk and your
desk is facing the window,

00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you can say, well, I
love to see the window.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.650 align:middle line:10%
I say, yeah, that's
great, but there's nobody

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:10%
coming in through the window.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, who comes
through the window?

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
through the door.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.377 align:middle line:84%
People, energy comes
through the door.

00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:90%
So you have to see the door.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you do that, the
universe is realigning with you

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and saying, oh, she's open
or he's open to opportunities

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.210 align:middle line:90%
and wonderful things.

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And so what you see is
that, energetically,

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:84%
as you're turning things around,
something turns in yourself.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:10%
And you start opening
windows, and doors,

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:10%
and phone calls start happening,
and emails start happening.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like, for example, if I
want to go and do something,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, I'll-- I want to
connect with, uh-- I remember,

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.780 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, I
was like, I'm ready

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:90%
to speak in Russian in Russia.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just put on
my vision board,

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:09.170 align:middle line:84%
in my success direction,
Russia, here I come.

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And a week later,
I got, you know,

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.660 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful reaction from
Russia to come and speak

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:90%
there for 3,000 women.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, ah.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Now did I do something for it?
Eh.

00:40:20.779 --> 00:40:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I put it on my vision board and
I said to the universe, hello!

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to go!

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how I work.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I would say my vision
board and my inner vision

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:90%
board are aligned.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And my home, who is a
three dimensional vision

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:90%
board, you know, is aligned.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And so even in every hotel
room, in my success direction,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I put immediately
my business cards,

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:84%
my products, my little
picture of my vision board

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.050 align:middle line:90%
that I have with me.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And in my relationship
direction I always

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.671 align:middle line:84%
make sure there's family and
the business cards of the people

00:40:53.671 --> 00:40:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I need to meet.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Or I write it down on
a little Post-it note.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, a little-- this
morning, Lilou, you know,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:90%
is going to meet with me.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's always aligning.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
All the time aligning
and following the flow.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Would you call also
outside, external forces

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
to help you along the way?
-Yes.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.235 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, for me,
I believe god and the universe

00:41:17.235 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:84%
is in everything I am
and in everything I do.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are always
mentors, and masters,

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and angels, and guides,
and people, you know,

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.260 align:middle line:84%
that are loving and
supporting to you.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And of course you can.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The more the better,
I would always say.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But you can bring them all
in, but if you do not believe

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with the
god within yourself,

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:44.646 align:middle line:84%
you know, these outside forces
cannot support you as much.

00:41:44.646 --> 00:41:45.345 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:45.345 --> 00:41:48.391 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have to always
first go within yourself.

00:41:48.391 --> 00:41:49.400 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.690 align:middle line:84%
You're part of the
Transformational

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Leadership Program.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.020 align:middle line:84%
What-- what are you
guys working on?

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Are there some things
that you're excited about?

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.631 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm a founding member
of the Transformational

00:42:01.631 --> 00:42:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Leadership Counsel.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually presiding
now the association

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.970 align:middle line:90%
chapter in Europe.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm very excited about that.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.171 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually bringing--
-Congratulations.

00:42:10.171 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing in the-- the
transformation leaders,

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:90%
bringing them together.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, the
transformation leaders

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
in the entertainment
industry, or in the self help,

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:84%
or in the business industry,
they're working also hard.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And they are just giving
and helping so many people.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we just need
to get together and kind

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:34.260 align:middle line:84%
of re-nurture ourselves.
Just--

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Mm hm.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So that has been an amazing
aspect and to become friends

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:90%
also with other leaders.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.485 align:middle line:84%
-Your environment.
-Your environment.

00:42:42.485 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Who you connect with.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And to say like,
you know, if there's

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.730 align:middle line:84%
somebody that needs some help,
you can give them a call.

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It has become of a
beautiful family.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, Jack
Canfield started that idea

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:56.960 align:middle line:90%
just in his living room.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky to be invited
as his, at that time, adviser

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and to be part of it.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And I remember sitting there.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, all
these important people.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, I felt very shy.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And Jack said-- very
kindly, he said,

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.841 align:middle line:84%
one day, Marie, you will be
as famous as everyone else.

00:43:10.841 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, this
is part of my journey.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.160 align:middle line:84%
If I want to reach
500 million people,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have to accept
that I'm a transformation

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.310 align:middle line:90%
leader to reach all of you.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
really are working on

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is supporting each
other to be better

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:90%
in our transformation work.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that's our
major focus, so that we

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.570 align:middle line:84%
feel re-energized each time
when we are with each other.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And we give each other,
you know, support

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and love because we are
giving constantly, you know?

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But you've also learned,
all of you guys, to receive.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.091 align:middle line:84%
It's a big one.
-We do.

00:43:52.091 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We do.
And receiving from each other.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we receive love
and support from other people--

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.040 align:middle line:84%
In abundance because the
transformation leaders are

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.730 align:middle line:90%
successful, financially, too.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.290 align:middle line:90%
We do allow that also to come.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's an important
part because how can

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:84%
we, otherwise,
provide the material?

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Can we provide time for people?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know, all
of the transformation leaders

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.300 align:middle line:84%
are really wonderful in charity,
and tiding, and giving back,

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, many free
hours to the community.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.331 align:middle line:84%
It's another part of the law
of attraction, tiding, huh?

00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Tiding, scholarship,
giving freely, you know?

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Every knows that.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's
a minimum of 10%.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:84%
If-- you know,
sometimes it's 30%,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.714 align:middle line:84%
you know, that we--
and sometimes there

00:44:41.714 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:84%
are weeks that you're
like, well, I've

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.370 align:middle line:84%
been giving the whole
week and-- but, you

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:48.440 align:middle line:84%
know, the universe is
always giving back,

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.160 align:middle line:90%
abundantly, back to you.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's time, it's
effort, it's connections.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's like
somebody-- like two days ago,

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:84%
somebody really, really
needed some huge support

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.130 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.971 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, OK, I'll
make a phone call, right?

00:45:03.971 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Here.
Call them.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:06.554 align:middle line:90%
So it can be that.

00:45:06.554 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're a
transformation leader,

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.485 align:middle line:84%
you have more access
sometimes to people in power

00:45:12.485 --> 00:45:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and with a lot of networking.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
make a phone call.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that already is also a
giving back to the world.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:25.121 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, we have our own
material needs, I always say.

00:45:25.121 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Like in the ancient times,
when you were a transformation

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:84%
leader, you were a
priest, a high priest,

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:84%
you were supported
by the community.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's not always
possible anymore.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, that's
why we have also clients

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.661 align:middle line:84%
that's pay you and support you
with books-- buying your books

00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Or giving you that
financial-- so we can

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.790 align:middle line:90%
continue the work we're doing.

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.626 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we are
not able to do that.

00:45:50.626 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Yeah.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.945 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you very
much for your generous,

00:45:54.945 --> 00:45:58.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, contribution here
to this global conversation

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people want
this information, especially

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:01.530 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV.

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I know they're-- they're
very-- they're curious

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.020 align:middle line:90%
and they want to learn more.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And I love that and
I'm, too, part of that.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And-- and how can we summarize
everything that we've said,

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.300 align:middle line:84%
so that we can leave everybody
with-- with something really

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.450 align:middle line:90%
powerful and to remember?

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe that you are,
in whatever field you are,

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:21.975 align:middle line:90%
an enlightened leader.

00:46:21.975 --> 00:46:23.075 align:middle line:84%
It can mean an
enlightened leader

00:46:23.075 --> 00:46:25.840 align:middle line:84%
in your family, an enlightened
leader in your community,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:90%
for the world.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And so you can only
really connect with that,

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:84%
if you truly trust, really
trust the light that you have

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and start being that loving
person that you're here to be.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's what
we all are here for.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.767 align:middle line:84%
And to be more of that
light that you already are.

00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:41.942 align:middle line:84%
-Mm.
-Yeah.

00:46:41.942 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Because we're all that light.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Even though if we have moments
of that depression or darkness,

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.390 align:middle line:84%
there is-- obviously,
there is a light.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.270 align:middle line:90%
We can find it.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We do have sometimes
shadow side,

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, shadow
moments in our life.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But I always say, you know,
sometimes that shadow side

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.190 align:middle line:90%
helps us to find the light.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:59.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
important part of it.

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much, Marie
Diamond for this beautiful time

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:09.350 align:middle line:84%
here in Monaco in the
Principato di Monaco

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:13.390 align:middle line:84%
in Monte Carlo, where the
Formula 1-- and there's a lot,

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of very abundant,
wealthy people here.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.811 align:middle line:84%
And you want to move here?
-Yes.

00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
I'm relocating in this area.

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.375 align:middle line:84%
Not to Monaco itself, but
just a little bit outside.

00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:23.074 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And, um-- but there's a lot of
wonderful, wealthy people here,

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but very giving.
-Yeah.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
places with the most

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:90%
charity donations in the world.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of
wealthy people also

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.390 align:middle line:84%
know that it's
part of their task,

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.580 align:middle line:90%
once they have the wealth.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.907 align:middle line:84%
And so Monaco is very well
known for their giving back.

00:47:42.907 --> 00:47:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
I've discovered

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
throughout those videos and
interviews here in Monaco.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't expecting that
because what you see first,

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:50.830 align:middle line:84%
of course, is those
beautiful big yachts, and

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.800 align:middle line:90%
huge properties, and big cars.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, OK, this
is out of proportion maybe,

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:84%
this yacht compared
to some other things.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.570 align:middle line:84%
You find really generous
people that are ready to help

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.921 align:middle line:84%
and give, so this is wonderful.
-Yeah.

00:48:03.921 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there
are just regular people

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.310 align:middle line:84%
like us that are, perhaps,
you know, living here.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's also-- it's
a vibrational field

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.150 align:middle line:90%
of wealth and generosity.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's a
combination that I haven't

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:90%
found in many other places.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And Prince Albert
shows the way.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I think he definitely
does with his lovely wife.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.031 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
-Thank you.

00:48:26.031 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Much, much love to
all of you watching.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching Gaiam TV.

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.341 align:middle line:84%
We sen you lots and lots of
love and light from Monaco.

00:48:35.341 --> 00:48:36.940 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-Bye.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Bye.
