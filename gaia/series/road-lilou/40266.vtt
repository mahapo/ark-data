00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my juicy
co-creators.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.349 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road in
London, in England,

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.219 align:middle line:84%
north of London actually
in Hampstead.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:21.322 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting here in
Rupert Sheldrake's home.

00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.857 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful,
magical moment for me.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.829 align:middle line:84%
I hear many, many times your
name pop into these interviews

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.933 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited to talk with you
today about your latest book,

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.903 align:middle line:84%
and all your work, and the
difference that you have made

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.839 align:middle line:84%
in helping us to
discover - you know -

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.509 align:middle line:84%
how maybe you were
all interlinked.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.979 align:middle line:84%
We all have -- we're
more than just --

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.982 align:middle line:84%
this universe is more
than just mechanics.

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.017 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for all the
work that you have done.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.785 align:middle line:84%
You have a tremendous
background -

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.454 align:middle line:90%
academic background - of course.

00:00:53.454 --> 00:00:55.756 align:middle line:84%
You've studied and
were a professor in --

00:00:55.756 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:84%
for Cambridge University and in
Harvard, and wrote many books,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.197 align:middle line:90%
many papers, scientific papers.

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:90%
What a career?

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Rupert Sheldrake: Well, yes.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean I've done all those kind
of standard academic things.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.639 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't actually a professor
at Cambridge or Harvard

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.708 align:middle line:90%
but I was teaching there.

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I try to find out
what's really going on.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.484 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is a long
term, scientific endeavor.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:25.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes, so I want to
speak of your latest book,

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.657 align:middle line:84%
but before that, a little bit
-- let's a little bit backtrack

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.159 align:middle line:84%
to this moment after being
in India, after this time

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.397 align:middle line:84%
in the Ashram, all of
a sudden after that,

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:37.665 align:middle line:90%
something opened up for you.

00:01:37.665 --> 00:01:40.367 align:middle line:84%
Now as a scientist,
was it at that time

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:45.706 align:middle line:84%
that you start really -- well
you wrote the book afterwards?

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: No, I was --
when I was at Cambridge,

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:50.444 align:middle line:84%
even when I was a
student, I began to think

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:84%
that the standard kind of
science is too limited,

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.783 align:middle line:90%
this mechanistic science.

00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.252 align:middle line:84%
Animals and plants
are just machines.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.087 align:middle line:90%
I just knew that wasn't true.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:05.492 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know how to move
beyond it scientifically.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It was when I was doing research
at Cambridge that I fast hit

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.568 align:middle line:84%
on the possibility of a
completely new type of biology.

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:17.338 align:middle line:84%
That's when I came up with
my idea of morphic resonance:

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:20.207 align:middle line:90%
a kind of memory in nature.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:22.843 align:middle line:84%
But I realized this would
be highly controversial

00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:27.381 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't sure whether it was
a good enough idea to publish.

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So I went to India
where I worked

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.319 align:middle line:90%
in an agricultural institute

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
for five years before I
published this theory.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.127 align:middle line:84%
I took time off and lived
in an Ashram in south India

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
where I wrote my first book,
"A New Science of Life."

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.466 align:middle line:84%
But really, this period
in India was a period

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:48.535 align:middle line:84%
of developing the idea,
carrying it forward,

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.738 align:middle line:90%
and further exploration.

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:54.975 align:middle line:84%
But the gem of the idea was
already there in Cambridge.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.811 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So what did you
-- start from the beginning.

00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:00.681 align:middle line:84%
What kind of thoughts, because
it's pretty thought provoking

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.617 align:middle line:84%
what you put together
for regular science

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.986 align:middle line:90%
or materialist type of science.

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:11.158 align:middle line:84%
How did you -- how were you
able to prove what you wanted

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.961 align:middle line:90%
to bring about into the world?

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, the thing is
that when I was doing research

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.232 align:middle line:84%
and developmental
biology at Cambridge,

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:19.867 align:middle line:90%
I was studying how plants grow.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.069 align:middle line:90%
That was my main concern.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.139 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't starting from
consciousness or parapsychology

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.975 align:middle line:84%
or -- I wasn't very interested
in those subjects at the time.

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:32.446 align:middle line:84%
I was primarily working
in developmental biology.

00:03:32.446 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized that genes
can't explain the development

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:38.552 align:middle line:90%
of organisms.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:39.687 align:middle line:90%
I came to the conclusion

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that genes are tremendously
overrated.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.125 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a conclusion
most people have now come

00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:49.096 align:middle line:84%
to as a result of what's called
The Missing Heritability Problem

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:52.466 align:middle line:84%
that really showed
up in around 2008.

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.703 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that genes
account for only 5 to 10 percent

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:58.572 align:middle line:84%
of heredity and most
characteristics.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.542 align:middle line:84%
So I knew there was
something else.

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:05.846 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that organisms
had to be shaped

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:10.551 align:middle line:84%
by formative influences which
I called morphogenetic fields.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.454 align:middle line:84%
This was based on a
standard idea in biology.

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:84%
I didn't invent the idea
of morphogenetic fields.

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:90%
But for me the key question was,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.361 align:middle line:84%
"How are these fields
inherited?"

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:23.163 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I came up with
the idea of morphic resonance:

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.699 align:middle line:84%
a form of memory that
works across time,

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.802 align:middle line:90%
directly by a kind of resonance.

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:84%
And this idea was really
primarily developed

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.309 align:middle line:84%
to explain the inheritance
of form in plants:

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:37.344 align:middle line:90%
how plants inherit their form.

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:39.413 align:middle line:84%
How a palm tree grows
into a palm tree

00:04:39.413 --> 00:04:42.082 align:middle line:84%
and how a cabbage
grows into a cabbage.

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.552 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided
there had to be a kind

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:47.888 align:middle line:90%
of memory, even in plants.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.423 align:middle line:90%
The same applies to animals.

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.058 align:middle line:90%
They have a kind of memory.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:54.495 align:middle line:84%
Instincts are a kind of
memory of the species

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:57.564 align:middle line:84%
and animal forms are
a kind of memory.

00:04:57.564 --> 00:05:01.101 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized this
theory made predictions.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.837 align:middle line:84%
If you train rats to learn
a new trick in one place,

00:05:03.837 --> 00:05:04.972 align:middle line:90%
then rats should be able

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.441 align:middle line:84%
to learn the same trick
quicker everywhere else.

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I found there's
actually already evidence

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.681 align:middle line:84%
I made a whole range of other
predictions which I've been able

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:90%
to test over the years.

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:21.221 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out there is a kind
of memory on which we all draw

00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:22.689 align:middle line:90%
and to which we all contribute.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.492 align:middle line:84%
There's a collective
memory among humans

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the
psychologist Jung called The

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Collective Unconscious.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.434 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense this
provides a scientific basis

00:05:33.434 --> 00:05:35.803 align:middle line:84%
for what Jung had
already developed:

00:05:35.803 --> 00:05:38.806 align:middle line:84%
and idea of a collective
human memory.

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:41.541 align:middle line:84%
So I think we all draw on a
collective memory and we all

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:44.945 align:middle line:90%
in turn contribute to it.

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:48.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's fascinating to
me how we seem to inherit --

00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:50.717 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying no,
it's actually a memory

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.952 align:middle line:90%
that is already there.

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.555 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just -- because
for example the children

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.458 align:middle line:84%
that are born these days,
they seem to have --

00:05:57.458 --> 00:06:01.562 align:middle line:84%
be with ease with the internet
or be at ease with even some

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:05.732 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual concepts you
know, and have no resistance.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:08.135 align:middle line:90%
So is that -- is that --

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:11.371 align:middle line:84%
how does that play for human
beings in our daily life?

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:12.773 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:16.777 align:middle line:84%
What did this specific research
means for us as human beings?

00:06:16.777 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, part of our
inheritance is in fact genetic.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:23.851 align:middle line:84%
You know that genes enable us
to make the right proteins.

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.887 align:middle line:84%
If we have a defective gene and
we make a defective protein,

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.957 align:middle line:84%
then we'll have some
defect in our metabolism

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:32.993 align:middle line:90%
or in some part of our body.

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:35.028 align:middle line:90%
So genes play a part.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:84%
There's also epigenetic
inheritance,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.567 align:middle line:84%
what our parents have done or
our grandparents have done,

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:43.403 align:middle line:84%
and can influence the way
the genes are expressed.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:47.207 align:middle line:84%
And until about the year 2000,
that was a heresy in biology.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:49.843 align:middle line:90%
It's now mainstream.

00:06:49.843 --> 00:06:53.146 align:middle line:84%
But in addition to all that,
I think we inherit a lot

00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:56.416 align:middle line:84%
by collective memory:
by morphic resonance.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when people
learn computer programming

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.191 align:middle line:84%
or learn new skills like
windsurfing or skydiving

00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle line:84%
or snowboarding, that as
subsequent people come along

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.298 align:middle line:84%
and try to learn these
things, they're easier

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.567 align:middle line:90%
because of morphic resonance.

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:18.138 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why
children can learn some things

00:07:18.138 --> 00:07:20.707 align:middle line:84%
that are quite hard
for older people

00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:24.912 align:middle line:84%
because just become much easier
to do certain kinds of things:

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:27.514 align:middle line:90%
physical skills, skateboarding,

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:31.285 align:middle line:84%
computer programming
skills and so on.

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:34.154 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is all part
of morphic resonance and--

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:35.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:36.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: -and part
of our collective memory.

00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:39.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there such a thing
as a negative morphic resonance?

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.195 align:middle line:84%
Something in that we're kind
of stuck with and that --

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:45.198 align:middle line:84%
that is not making
our species evolve?

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well morphic
resonance is about habits.

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:84%
In its most general sense,
it says the so-called laws

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.506 align:middle line:90%
of nature are more like habits.

00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it really
propagates any habit.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.479 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the fastest
spreading habit in the world

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.048 align:middle line:90%
at the moment is consumerism.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.317 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we in the west
have converted the rest

00:08:03.317 --> 00:08:04.651 align:middle line:90%
of the world to this.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:08.155 align:middle line:84%
So there's now supermarkets
and TV commercials in India

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.257 align:middle line:90%
and China and everywhere else.

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And the habits of mind
that go with that,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.262 align:middle line:90%
spreading extremely fast.

00:08:15.262 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think these
are really bad habits

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.865 align:middle line:84%
and they're destroying
the planet.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:22.869 align:middle line:84%
But morphic resonance doesn't
have a built in moral filter.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:25.572 align:middle line:84%
It simply enables
habits to propagate.

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:29.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I know in your latest
book here that I'm holding,

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.445 align:middle line:84%
actually the American
version, "Science Set Free,"

00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:35.748 align:middle line:84%
you really go into those
dogma and to those things

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:38.585 align:middle line:84%
that are said but can be even
dangerous for our society.

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:42.689 align:middle line:84%
What are some of those dogmas
or things that science -

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:46.393 align:middle line:84%
traditional science
- has brought to us

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:50.097 align:middle line:84%
that is really holding us back
even are dangerous for us?

00:08:50.097 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well,
there are 10 basic dogmas

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:90%
that modern science is based on.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.136 align:middle line:84%
And these are things that
anyone who studies science,

00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:59.606 align:middle line:84%
just absorbs by a
kind of osmosis.

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:03.076 align:middle line:84%
And people who haven't studied
science usually believe them too

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.879 align:middle line:84%
because they think science has
shown these are true.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.447 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
only assumptions

00:09:07.447 --> 00:09:09.016 align:middle line:84%
and they've never been
proved to be true.

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.118 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I think they're false.

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And what I argue in my book is
that by questioning the dogmas,

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.324 align:middle line:90%
we can go beyond them.

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, science
opens up in a new way.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.662 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very pro-science.

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.463 align:middle line:90%
I'm not anti-science.

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:26.433 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that science
has had a huge number

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:29.536 align:middle line:84%
of very serious advances.
We wouldn't have TV

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:33.173 align:middle line:84%
and the internet and cell
phones and jet planes

00:09:33.173 --> 00:09:36.176 align:middle line:84%
or modern medicine and the
keyhole surgery and things,

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:39.312 align:middle line:84%
without these tremendous
advances of science.

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:42.282 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the first to say,
"Yes, this is very important."

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:43.717 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the end.

00:09:43.717 --> 00:09:45.252 align:middle line:90%
We need to go further.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:48.522 align:middle line:84%
And the assumptions are, first
that nature's mechanical.

00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:50.323 align:middle line:90%
Everything's machine-like.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.393 align:middle line:84%
That's Number 1 of the
scientific assumptions.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:56.863 align:middle line:84%
So you and I in Richard
Dawkins vivid phrase,

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.598 align:middle line:90%
"Are lumbering robots."

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:02.502 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are nothing but
genetically programmed brains.

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:05.772 align:middle line:84%
So that's Assumption 1:
everything's machine-like.

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.574 align:middle line:84%
You say that's not really
a theory that's proved.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.209 align:middle line:90%
It's just a metaphor.

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.378 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
very limited metaphor.

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:12.813 align:middle line:84%
I think it's much
better to think

00:10:12.813 --> 00:10:14.881 align:middle line:84%
of the universe as
organism-like.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:18.318 align:middle line:84%
The universe is much more like
an organism than a machine.

00:10:18.318 --> 00:10:21.421 align:middle line:84%
It starts very small,
like a fertilized egg.

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:22.823 align:middle line:90%
The big bang's like the

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.324 align:middle line:90%
hatching of the cosmic egg.

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:26.827 align:middle line:84%
And the whole universe has
been growing ever since

00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:29.029 align:middle line:84%
and developing new
structures within it.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.431 align:middle line:84%
That's much more like
a developing plant

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:35.669 align:middle line:84%
or an animal embryo on a vast
scale than like a machine.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.938 align:middle line:90%
No machine behaves like that.

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:40.307 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's just
simply false

00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:41.908 align:middle line:84%
to think all nature
is mechanical.

00:10:41.908 --> 00:10:44.544 align:middle line:84%
It's an analogy which
has limited usefulness

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and is not a truth
or something.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How can
nature be purposeless?

00:10:48.315 --> 00:10:49.648 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, that's
one of the other assumptions,

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.352 align:middle line:90%
that nature's purposeless.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:10:55.021 align:middle line:84%
And that follows from
the machine metaphor.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the assumption
that matter's unconscious.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.496 align:middle line:84%
It simply assumed that
the whole universe is made

00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
of unconscious matter.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.099 align:middle line:84%
That this earth's made
of unconscious matter.

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:84%
And mysteriously,
we're conscious.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.037 align:middle line:84%
But there's no explanation
for that

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because it was assumed
all matter's unconscious.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.276 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is not
something that's being proved.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:19.479 align:middle line:84%
It's being assumed in science
since in the 17th Century

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:23.316 align:middle line:84%
that great French philosopher
Rene Descartes said that,

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:24.351 align:middle line:90%
"Matter's unconscious."

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
He defined matter
as unconscious.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.256 align:middle line:84%
So it was just simply
not discussed.

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:30.991 align:middle line:90%
It was defined that way.

00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.161 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think this is a
very limiting assumption

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.463 align:middle line:84%
and it's not something
science has proved.

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:37.798 align:middle line:90%
It's just simply assumed.

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:41.635 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the idea all
the laws of nature are fixed.

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:42.969 align:middle line:90%
That's another dogma.

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle line:84%
All the laws of nature are
fixed the way they are today,

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.677 align:middle line:84%
at the moment of the Big Bang
and so were the constants.

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:54.481 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think in an evolving
universe such as ours is,

00:11:54.481 --> 00:11:57.317 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature are not
fixed and I think they are

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:58.652 align:middle line:90%
in fact more like habits.

00:11:58.652 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
They evolve along with nature.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.257 align:middle line:84%
That's part of my
morphic resonance theory.

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:06.459 align:middle line:90%
And I think the constants

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:09.496 align:middle line:84%
or so-called constants
also, can vary.

00:12:09.496 --> 00:12:12.032 align:middle line:90%
The evidence shows they do vary.

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:17.103 align:middle line:84%
So that assumption I think is
simply wrong, but it's something

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:20.307 align:middle line:84%
that most scientists
take for granted.

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:22.709 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the assumption
that the total amount of matter

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:26.279 align:middle line:84%
and energy is always the
same except in the moment

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:29.649 align:middle line:84%
of the Big Bang when it all
suddenly appeared from nowhere.

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:31.852 align:middle line:90%
That's the standard assumption.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:35.155 align:middle line:84%
But actually, although
most people treat this

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:39.726 align:middle line:84%
as some sacrosanct
truth, it's not a truth

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.828 align:middle line:90%
at all within physics.

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:44.931 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1980s,
they've invented

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:49.135 align:middle line:84%
or hypothesized huge quantities
of so-called dark matter

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:51.938 align:middle line:84%
and dark energy, known
as what they are.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:52.906 align:middle line:90%
But they're now believe

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:55.742 align:middle line:84%
to constitute 96
percent of reality.

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:58.845 align:middle line:84%
So the physics and chemistry
that you learned at school

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:03.116 align:middle line:84%
and the -- applies to
4 percent of reality.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.585 align:middle line:84%
At 96 percent is
of unknown nature

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:08.421 align:middle line:84%
and we have no idea whether
the total amount is conserved

00:13:08.421 --> 00:13:11.925 align:middle line:84%
or not, or whether it can be
converted into regular matter

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.461 align:middle line:90%
and energy or vice versa.

00:13:14.461 --> 00:13:16.263 align:middle line:90%
These are simply open questions

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and so the assumption the total
amount's always the same is a

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.202 align:middle line:90%
carryover from the 19th Century,

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:25.071 align:middle line:84%
but modern science has
left it far behind.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:90%
So the next assumption is

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:32.812 align:middle line:84%
that the biological
inheritance depends on genes

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:36.549 align:middle line:84%
and epigenetic modifications
alone

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:41.721 align:middle line:84%
and cytoplasmic inheritance
like mitochondria.

00:13:41.721 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is that a large amount

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.559 align:middle line:84%
of inheritance depends
on morphic resonance.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:48.295 align:middle line:90%
It's not just material.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:49.796 align:middle line:90%
I've already discussed that.

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:52.599 align:middle line:90%
Then there's the assumption

00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:56.002 align:middle line:84%
that all our memories are
stored inside our brains.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.806 align:middle line:84%
Everything you remember's
somewhere inside your head.

00:13:59.806 --> 00:14:01.808 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you remember
what you did last year

00:14:01.808 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
when you went on holiday.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.313 align:middle line:84%
Somehow in your -- in
modified nerve endings

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:08.882 align:middle line:84%
or phosphorylated
proteins, every detail

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:12.819 align:middle line:84%
that you can remember is
somehow inside your brain.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.688 align:middle line:84%
Well people have looked
for memories in brains

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:16.523 align:middle line:90%
and they've failed to find them.

00:14:16.523 --> 00:14:18.725 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
because they're not there.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:21.127 align:middle line:84%
I think the brain's
more like a TV receiver

00:14:21.127 --> 00:14:22.829 align:middle line:90%
than a video recorder.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.564 align:middle line:90%
It tunes into the past.

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't store it.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.568 align:middle line:90%
Then there's the assumption

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:31.471 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is nothing bit
the activity of the brain.

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.175 align:middle line:84%
Your mind's inside
your head and confined

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.943 align:middle line:90%
to the inside of your head.

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:40.747 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think that's
completely misleading.

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:43.516 align:middle line:84%
I think our minds extend
far beyond our brains

00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:45.352 align:middle line:90%
through fields.

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:49.622 align:middle line:84%
Magnets extend beyond a
magnet through fields.

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:52.792 align:middle line:84%
The field of your cellphone
extends beyond the cellphone

00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:54.627 align:middle line:90%
through invisible fields.

00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:57.263 align:middle line:84%
And I think our minds
extend beyond our brains

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:90%
through invisible fields.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:02.335 align:middle line:84%
When we look at somebody,
I think our mind

00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:04.104 align:middle line:84%
in a sense reaches
out to touch them

00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:05.472 align:middle line:90%
which is why people can tell

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:09.042 align:middle line:84%
when they're being
looked at from behind.

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:11.244 align:middle line:84%
So I think the mind's
extended beyond the brain

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.712 align:middle line:90%
in every act of perception.

00:15:12.712 --> 00:15:17.283 align:middle line:84%
As I look at you now, I think my
image of you is where you are.

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.985 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
inside my head.

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:20.987 align:middle line:84%
And I think your image
of me is right here,

00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:24.124 align:middle line:84%
not inside your head, but the
official view is it's all inside

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:25.325 align:middle line:90%
your head.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:28.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Did you look at
them in that same field

00:15:28.361 --> 00:15:33.066 align:middle line:84%
into the near death experiences
and how this whole --

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:38.605 align:middle line:84%
how when the consciousness
still is at people when they are

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.206 align:middle line:84%
into these near death
experience,

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:41.941 align:middle line:90%
experience real consciousness.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.676 align:middle line:84%
Even in the brain,
it has stopped.

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.612 align:middle line:84%
Have you looked into
this as well?

00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, I've
never done research myself

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.815 align:middle line:90%
on near death experiences.

00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:51.451 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think there's
plenty of evidence that lots

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.987 align:middle line:84%
of people have these
experiences.

00:15:53.987 --> 00:15:54.921 align:middle line:90%
And it's also--

00:15:54.921 --> 00:15:56.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And that
they are real.

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, the
experiences are real.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
The question though is,
because they're only near death

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.264 align:middle line:84%
experiences and everyone who's
had one has obviously come back

00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:07.867 align:middle line:84%
to life again, otherwise we
wouldn't know about them.

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:11.337 align:middle line:84%
They're not conclusive proof
of survival after bodily death

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:12.572 align:middle line:90%
but they do tell us something

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:14.774 align:middle line:84%
about how our consciousness
needs --

00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:19.479 align:middle line:84%
our experiences can detach
themselves from our bodies.

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:24.884 align:middle line:84%
But I myself [coughing]
think that we already know

00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:28.421 align:middle line:84%
that because every one
of us dreams every night.

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:31.624 align:middle line:84%
Most of us forget our
dreams, but in our dreams,

00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
our physical body's
laying asleep in bed.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.863 align:middle line:84%
And we have another
body - our dream body -

00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:38.798 align:middle line:84%
which is doing things
in our dreams.

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:44.304 align:middle line:84%
I mean, walking around, talked
to people, flying sometimes.

00:16:44.304 --> 00:16:47.107 align:middle line:84%
So we have another
body that's separate

00:16:47.107 --> 00:16:50.877 align:middle line:84%
from our physical
body in every dream.

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:53.246 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, I think near
death experiences are a bit

00:16:53.246 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
like the dream body, but we
experience that coming to it

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:03.956 align:middle line:84%
from usually in an accident or
some extreme physical condition.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.126 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's very
similar to dreaming

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.227 align:middle line:90%
and we all know about that.

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle line:84%
Even without having
near death experiences.

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:14.501 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That can go all
the way to premonitions too.

00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:17.704 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with Dr. Larry Dose
about that topic.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:22.475 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting how we
can receive images, information.

00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:25.311 align:middle line:84%
Do you get into that
too in the book?

00:17:25.311 --> 00:17:26.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Sheldrake: A bit, yes.

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
In this book, I summarize some
of my research on premonitions

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:84%
but mostly I discuss, actually,
in my book the sense of being

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.558 align:middle line:84%
stared at and other aspects
of the extended mind.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.729 align:middle line:84%
In that book, I go into detail
into my research on the feeling

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:46.933 align:middle line:84%
of being stared at, on
telepathy, and on premonitions.

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:50.403 align:middle line:84%
As I think all of these are
powers of our extended minds.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.807 align:middle line:84%
I think our minds extend
in space and in time.

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:56.242 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just confined
to the inside of the head

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.611 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:17:58.611 --> 00:18:00.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So going
back to those dogmas,

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:03.016 align:middle line:84%
how are those actually
dangerous?

00:18:03.016 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Why are you using the word
"dangerous" for humanity?

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well,
I don't think --

00:18:10.623 --> 00:18:12.258 align:middle line:84%
well I think why
they're dangerous is

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.861 align:middle line:84%
because they give a misleading
idea of the way the world is.

00:18:14.861 --> 00:18:18.565 align:middle line:84%
They give us a false impression
of nature and of ourselves.

00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:22.035 align:middle line:84%
And that's dangerous because
if we think nature's just a

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:25.572 align:middle line:84%
machine, if we think nothing
else is conscious except us,

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:28.474 align:middle line:84%
if we think our mind's our
nothing but our brains,

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:31.878 align:middle line:84%
then we treat the world
in a different way

00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:34.581 align:middle line:84%
from if the way we see
the universe is alive

00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:36.382 align:middle line:84%
and the world is alive,
as if we see Gaia

00:18:36.382 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
as a living organism, it
makes a big difference.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.024 align:middle line:84%
If we see ourselves as
just machines and our minds

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:48.194 align:middle line:84%
as just inside our brains,
it leads to a terrible sense

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:51.097 align:middle line:90%
of alienation and disconnection.

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
significant but one

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.935 align:middle line:90%
of the primary diseases,

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.972 align:middle line:84%
epidemic in the modern
world is depression.

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.007 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a world view
that says you're nothing

00:19:01.007 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
but your brain, your life
is basically pointless.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.712 align:middle line:90%
You have no free will.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:08.047 align:middle line:84%
The universe has no
purpose or direction.

00:19:08.047 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:84%
If your consciousness
is just snuffed

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:13.219 align:middle line:84%
out the minute your
brain decays,

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:16.256 align:middle line:84%
that you're not interconnected
with other people except

00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:18.825 align:middle line:84%
through conventional
communication.

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.995 align:middle line:84%
There's no other form of
bonding or connection.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a
deeply depressing view.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.733 align:middle line:90%
I mean the wonder to me is

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:29.636 align:middle line:84%
that even more people
aren't depressed.

00:19:29.636 --> 00:19:32.338 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
they're not is that most people

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:35.508 align:middle line:84%
in practice don't take this
worldview that seriously.

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:39.178 align:middle line:84%
But it is the official world
view of the educational system

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:44.417 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific establishment
of business and of government.

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And of how
we heal ourselves then.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, I
haven't come yet to Dogma 10

00:19:49.055 --> 00:19:50.423 align:middle line:90%
which is the dogma

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that mechanistic medicine's the
only kind that really works.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.529 align:middle line:84%
That's the assumption
that all alternative

00:19:56.529 --> 00:20:00.566 align:middle line:84%
and complementary methods
are simply fraudulent

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:04.971 align:middle line:84%
or people have got better anyway
or it's just the placebo effect.

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course we don't
understand the placebo effect,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.976 align:middle line:84%
but that's the way
it's usually dismissed.

00:20:09.976 --> 00:20:14.781 align:middle line:84%
So this leads to an extremely
one-sided medical system

00:20:14.781 --> 00:20:17.016 align:middle line:90%
which focuses only on physical

00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:20.119 align:middle line:84%
and chemical cures,
surgery, and drugs.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:22.322 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they have
a big role to play and all

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:25.258 align:middle line:84%
of us have benefited from
them, but most people know

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:27.493 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to
healing than that.

00:20:27.493 --> 00:20:28.995 align:middle line:90%
Even official medicine does

00:20:28.995 --> 00:20:32.799 align:middle line:84%
because the placebo effect
tells us that people's beliefs

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:37.236 align:middle line:84%
and expectations and hopes can
have an effect on their healing.

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.639 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of statistical
studies have shown

00:20:39.639 --> 00:20:44.277 align:middle line:84%
that people's social bonds
can affect their healing,

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:48.047 align:middle line:84%
how supported they are by
others, whether people pray

00:20:48.047 --> 00:20:49.782 align:middle line:84%
for them or not or
whether people pray

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:50.917 align:middle line:90%
for themselves or not.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.219 align:middle line:84%
Prayer and meditation
have a beneficial effect

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:54.354 align:middle line:90%
on health and healing.

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:55.588 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And music.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:58.191 align:middle line:84%
And I know your wife is
very much into the healing,

00:20:58.191 --> 00:21:00.526 align:middle line:84%
the music, and the
-- how this resonance

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:02.595 align:middle line:90%
and this vibration affects us.

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:03.529 align:middle line:90%
And-- ?

00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:04.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Oh
very much so, yes.

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
All these things
can affect healing.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a model
that says it's just drugs

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.206 align:middle line:84%
and surgery, then all the
money, all the funding,

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:15.641 align:middle line:84%
all the insurance, all the
national health service here

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:20.279 align:middle line:84%
in Britain, is directed towards
drugs and surgery, physical

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:24.183 align:middle line:84%
and chemical cures, and
ignores other methods of curing

00:21:24.183 --> 00:21:27.320 align:middle line:84%
which could be --
which are effective

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.458 align:middle line:84%
and which are usually
a lot cheaper.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Since you're so
passionate about the plants

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:36.596 align:middle line:84%
and about Gaia
and about all this,

00:21:36.596 --> 00:21:41.868 align:middle line:84%
have you gone closer study close
to shamans or in Amazonia

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:48.408 align:middle line:84%
or really where the plants
or with older not prophecies

00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:52.412 align:middle line:84%
but our ancestors or people that
are working still like Mayas

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:55.915 align:middle line:84%
or they're closer to nature
and healing in some ways thanks

00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:58.017 align:middle line:84%
to those plants and
with the spirit world?

00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:00.787 align:middle line:90%
Have you been close to that too?

00:22:00.787 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, when
I lived in India, I was --

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.925 align:middle line:84%
you know, I worked
with plants in India.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:11.731 align:middle line:84%
And I was -- I got interested
in Indian traditional medicine:

00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:15.401 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine and the
Muslim system, Unani medicine.

00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:18.504 align:middle line:84%
Both of those are very
herbally based.

00:22:18.504 --> 00:22:22.442 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I didn't
do an in depth study

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:26.112 align:middle line:84%
but I was certainly very curious
and interested about that.

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:30.616 align:middle line:84%
And I've met South American
healers who work with plants.

00:22:30.616 --> 00:22:33.386 align:middle line:84%
And here in Europe of course,
we have a long herbal tradition

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.821 align:middle line:90%
and my father was an herbalist.

00:22:34.821 --> 00:22:38.391 align:middle line:84%
So I mean I grew up surrounded
by herbs and healing plants so,

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:41.661 align:middle line:90%
and indeed, I mean most drugs

00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:43.596 align:middle line:84%
that we have today are
derived from plants.

00:22:43.596 --> 00:22:46.899 align:middle line:84%
So even in modern medicine,
a large part of it is derived

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:48.835 align:middle line:90%
from the herbal tradition.

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, are you saying that when
we leave the plants intact,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.176 align:middle line:84%
just as it is without
interfering too much

00:22:57.176 --> 00:23:01.814 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, it would
benefit greater to our species?

00:23:01.814 --> 00:23:05.952 align:middle line:84%
I mean is there a way
to go back to preserving

00:23:05.952 --> 00:23:09.856 align:middle line:84%
or to offering what really
nature wants us to offer

00:23:09.856 --> 00:23:13.459 align:middle line:84%
without putting some
of our stuff in there?

00:23:13.459 --> 00:23:14.827 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well,
I don't know.

00:23:14.827 --> 00:23:19.165 align:middle line:84%
I mean it would depend on you
know making detailed studies

00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:23.436 align:middle line:84%
of -- I mean, certainly
purified drugs are quite useful.

00:23:23.436 --> 00:23:25.738 align:middle line:90%
I mean if I have a headache,

00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:29.175 align:middle line:84%
which fortunately I very
rarely do, I take an aspirin.

00:23:29.175 --> 00:23:32.879 align:middle line:84%
And aspirin is a
chemically derived version

00:23:32.879 --> 00:23:35.014 align:middle line:84%
of something that's
based on the plant.

00:23:35.014 --> 00:23:38.818 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from Willow
Bark, acetylsalicylic acid.

00:23:38.818 --> 00:23:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But instead I don't go outdoors
and peel bark off a Willow Tree

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.192 align:middle line:90%
and make an infusion with it.

00:23:46.192 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I just take an aspirin.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:53.099 align:middle line:84%
So I do use these modern
drugs myself, not very often.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:57.703 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand
for certain things, I --

00:23:57.703 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
the herbal methods I
think are quite effective.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.908 align:middle line:90%
So I think it depends.

00:24:01.908 --> 00:24:05.278 align:middle line:84%
It's partly a matter
of convenience and most

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
of us find it more
convenient to take pills

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.217 align:middle line:90%
than to make infusions of herbs.

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:12.518 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I do both

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:15.888 align:middle line:84%
and herbal teas are
a wonderful thing

00:24:15.888 --> 00:24:18.457 align:middle line:90%
and many people take those.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:21.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It seems like
nature offers so much to us

00:24:21.727 --> 00:24:24.764 align:middle line:84%
and we're all already
on an intuitive level

00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:27.934 align:middle line:84%
after we're interconnected,
even though if I haven't studied

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:30.836 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific - you know
- basis this work,

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that more and more
right now as human beings,

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.009 align:middle line:84%
we're opening up
to our true nature.

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:40.413 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
nature is also showing us

00:24:40.413 --> 00:24:43.816 align:middle line:84%
or demonstrating right now
that we're starting to evolve

00:24:43.816 --> 00:24:48.754 align:middle line:84%
or does it really look bad
from a scientist's perspective?

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:52.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, I mean the
-- where everything's evolving.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.894 align:middle line:84%
We're evolving, the
natural world is evolving

00:24:54.894 --> 00:24:56.996 align:middle line:90%
in response to us.

00:24:56.996 --> 00:24:59.232 align:middle line:84%
And you know, plants
and animals --

00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:01.567 align:middle line:84%
some are being driven
to extinction by us,

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:05.438 align:middle line:84%
but others are adapting
to living in human cities.

00:25:05.438 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Some animals are
extremely adaptable

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.242 align:middle line:90%
like rats and cockroaches.

00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:12.311 align:middle line:84%
And however hard we try,
we can't get rid of them.

00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if we're totaling
in control, otherwise if rats

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:19.385 align:middle line:84%
and cockroaches would have
disappeared a long time ago,

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:22.321 align:middle line:90%
and so would mosquitos, so --

00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:27.059 align:middle line:84%
and even though we conquer
some diseases with antibiotics,

00:25:27.059 --> 00:25:30.496 align:middle line:84%
than the resistant forms of
these diseases reappears.

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:33.032 align:middle line:84%
So there's a continual
evolutionary progress --

00:25:33.032 --> 00:25:36.235 align:middle line:90%
process going on.

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:39.538 align:middle line:84%
In relation to the future
of humans on the planet,

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:42.241 align:middle line:84%
then you know obviously
we're using

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
up resources far too quickly
for this to be sustainable.

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.315 align:middle line:90%
So what will happen?

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:50.549 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.753 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no doubt we'll have
a whole series of crises

00:25:53.753 --> 00:25:55.454 align:middle line:90%
that we'll have to respond to.

00:25:55.454 --> 00:25:59.325 align:middle line:84%
And people generally
respond creatively to crises.

00:25:59.325 --> 00:26:04.597 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, most people don't
respond until they're forced to.

00:26:04.597 --> 00:26:07.933 align:middle line:84%
And I don't trust the present
political or economic system

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
to behave rationally,
but what I do expect is

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.773 align:middle line:90%
that when disasters strike,

00:26:13.773 --> 00:26:15.975 align:middle line:84%
then people will respond
to those disasters.

00:26:15.975 --> 00:26:19.011 align:middle line:84%
And I hope they'll
respond creatively.

00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Could we say that
when science will be set free

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.621 align:middle line:84%
or is set free, as human
beings, we will also be?

00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:30.556 align:middle line:90%
I mean is that how it works?

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:31.857 align:middle line:90%
That first science needs

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:35.961 align:middle line:84%
to be before we can really
do a quantum leap and evolve

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.765 align:middle line:84%
in the right direction,
if I could say?

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:41.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, I don't
think science is that important.

00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it affects
all our lives,

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.507 align:middle line:84%
but I think that what affects
political decisions is not

00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:49.909 align:middle line:90%
really science.

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:53.112 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I personally think the
science of climate change shows

00:26:53.112 --> 00:26:55.281 align:middle line:84%
that carbon dioxide
levels are rising.

00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.882 align:middle line:90%
The world's getting warmer.

00:26:56.882 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But -- and I think it's
mainly science partly --

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.622 align:middle line:90%
mainly human, partly the sun.

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:06.225 align:middle line:84%
But you know, from a
political point of view,

00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.327 align:middle line:84%
that's not very relevant
nowadays.

00:27:08.327 --> 00:27:12.898 align:middle line:84%
What matters is big business and
profit and investment and money

00:27:12.898 --> 00:27:16.802 align:middle line:84%
and rich people and there's a
huge influence over governments

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:18.504 align:middle line:90%
from all these forces.

00:27:18.504 --> 00:27:22.041 align:middle line:84%
And science doesn't
have much influence.

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:27.346 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the -- setting
science free is important

00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:90%
in several ways.

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, to give us a more
realistic understanding

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of nature, a more realistic
understanding of ourselves

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.624 align:middle line:84%
and of human nature, a more
comprehensive and better system

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:42.428 align:middle line:84%
of medicine, because right now
alternative medicines certainly

00:27:42.428 --> 00:27:45.364 align:middle line:84%
happen, but they're
not usually funded

00:27:45.364 --> 00:27:47.433 align:middle line:90%
or researched by governments.

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:50.503 align:middle line:84%
In the U.S., there is --
it's one of the few countries

00:27:50.503 --> 00:27:53.139 align:middle line:84%
in the world where there is
a government funded research

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:56.242 align:middle line:84%
effort on complementary
and alternative medicine,

00:27:56.242 --> 00:27:59.779 align:middle line:84%
but it's still a tiny fraction
of what's spent on molecular

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:03.516 align:middle line:84%
and medicine and drug
research and so forth.

00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:06.619 align:middle line:84%
So I think a more
realistic understanding

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:09.421 align:middle line:84%
of nature would be
better for us, healthier.

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:12.358 align:middle line:84%
It would break down the split
between humans and nature

00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:15.628 align:middle line:84%
and between mind and body,
and all these other splits

00:28:15.628 --> 00:28:19.064 align:middle line:84%
that cause so many problems
in the modern world.

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:21.567 align:middle line:84%
But above all, I think it
would be good for science.

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:23.569 align:middle line:84%
It would reinvigorate,
rejuvenate,

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.971 align:middle line:84%
science which would
become exciting

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:31.177 align:middle line:84%
and adventurous again instead
of being boring and committed

00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:34.446 align:middle line:84%
to kind of slow, incremental
improvement on a kind

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:90%
of business as usual line.

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:39.885 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a chance for
all sorts of new breakthroughs

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:43.689 align:middle line:84%
in many areas which I
describe in my book.

00:28:43.689 --> 00:28:45.891 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What would it
take because often I speak

00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:50.996 align:middle line:84%
with scientists or I even
-- in Montreal you know I --

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:54.066 align:middle line:84%
his name has just popped
out of my mind, but --

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:58.904 align:middle line:84%
oh, what is he -- that
is trying to break free

00:28:58.904 --> 00:29:03.609 align:middle line:84%
from this old way
of seeing the world.

00:29:03.609 --> 00:29:06.312 align:middle line:84%
What would it take in your
opinion you know, to really --

00:29:06.312 --> 00:29:08.981 align:middle line:84%
is that a matter, not even in
your opinion, but in the world,

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:13.919 align:middle line:84%
what does it take to bring
something to -- not to prove it,

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:15.721 align:middle line:90%
but to bring it to reality?

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:16.722 align:middle line:90%
Is that laws?

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:20.759 align:middle line:84%
Is that a reunion
of some people?

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.127 align:middle line:90%
Is it an agreement?

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:25.497 align:middle line:84%
How do you get it -- how do
you take it to the next stage?

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean of course books
like these change

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.771 align:middle line:84%
and scientific papers, but where
-- when does it just like start

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.507 align:middle line:84%
to really open up
and the world shifts?

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:37.543 align:middle line:84%
You know, at what point, what
is the tipping point here

00:29:37.543 --> 00:29:40.613 align:middle line:90%
with science to be set free?

00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:41.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well,
I think there's a lot

00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:84%
of scientists themselves are
already aware of the problems

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:48.354 align:middle line:84%
and would like science
to change.

00:29:48.354 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a question
of persuading scientists.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I often talk in scientific
institutes and universities

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.763 align:middle line:84%
and I find many scientists
are very sympathetic

00:29:57.763 --> 00:29:59.832 align:middle line:90%
to what I'm saying and --

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:02.067 align:middle line:84%
but they talk to me
in private about it.

00:30:02.067 --> 00:30:05.771 align:middle line:84%
And they usually say, "I can't
discuss this with my colleagues

00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:09.341 align:middle line:84%
because they are so
conservative and so straight

00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:12.278 align:middle line:90%
and not able to these things."

00:30:12.278 --> 00:30:15.314 align:middle line:84%
But, sometimes I have
quite a few people

00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:18.217 align:middle line:84%
from the same department tell me
the same thing, and then I said,

00:30:18.217 --> 00:30:20.319 align:middle line:84%
"Did you know that he was
really open to these things

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:22.221 align:middle line:84%
or that she's interested
in these things?"

00:30:22.221 --> 00:30:22.922 align:middle line:90%
They all, "No, no.

00:30:22.922 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
They're very straight."

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.859 align:middle line:84%
So you see part of it I think
would be a kind of coming

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:28.961 align:middle line:84%
out movement within
science and medicine

00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:32.031 align:middle line:84%
because there are many people
who already think differently,

00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:34.867 align:middle line:84%
but they don't dare say
so to their colleagues.

00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:36.669 align:middle line:84%
And I think if they
did dare say so,

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:39.805 align:middle line:84%
they'd find many other
people agreed with them.

00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:41.874 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have nothing
to lose in a sense

00:30:41.874 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
because I've already come
out, not in the closet

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:90%
as it were, but that's one step.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.549 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
just a sociological,

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:55.554 align:middle line:84%
a social movement really,
that could make a big change.

00:30:55.554 --> 00:30:58.223 align:middle line:84%
But the second step
may be related to that,

00:30:58.223 --> 00:31:01.226 align:middle line:84%
but it may be more
to do with politics

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:03.162 align:middle line:84%
and business, which
is the funding.

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:07.066 align:middle line:84%
Scientists do what they're
paid to do and if they know

00:31:07.066 --> 00:31:09.868 align:middle line:84%
that only certain kinds of
research will be funded,

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.471 align:middle line:84%
then that's what they
apply for grants for.

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:14.006 align:middle line:90%
And they don't bother applying

00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:16.208 align:middle line:84%
for something that's
radically new

00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:84%
because they know
it won't get funded.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.115 align:middle line:84%
So there's a self-censorship
within the scientific world.

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:26.819 align:middle line:84%
And the funding system
at the moment depends on,

00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:29.154 align:middle line:84%
largely on governments
and businesses.

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:35.394 align:middle line:84%
And they're largely advised
by establishment scientists.

00:31:35.394 --> 00:31:39.465 align:middle line:84%
And I think that freeing
up the funding would be --

00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:42.868 align:middle line:84%
is a crucial thing in
liberating science.

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:45.838 align:middle line:84%
One way forward would be
independent foundations

00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:48.907 align:middle line:84%
which now pay a lot of role
in the funding of science,

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.077 align:middle line:84%
who could work more
independently.

00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:53.645 align:middle line:84%
And I think if some
of them are encouraged

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.615 align:middle line:84%
to be more adventurous in
the way they fund science,

00:31:56.615 --> 00:31:58.784 align:middle line:84%
that could help to
free things up.

00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:00.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do
you think of the work

00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:90%
of Nassima Rameye?

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: I just haven't
studied it so I can't reply.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: But it -- the funding.

00:32:06.992 --> 00:32:09.161 align:middle line:84%
I mean we keep on
hearing that and even

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:12.131 align:middle line:84%
in society our regular people
are feeling the same --

00:32:12.131 --> 00:32:14.199 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything that you
have described is something

00:32:14.199 --> 00:32:17.236 align:middle line:84%
that all of us in
society feel, you know?

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:19.872 align:middle line:84%
That there is -- it seems
like the funds are allocated

00:32:19.872 --> 00:32:23.308 align:middle line:84%
to some other things and it's
more the pharmaceutical business

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.178 align:middle line:84%
or the lobbies or the this
because there's some interest

00:32:26.178 --> 00:32:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and the government and
the politics are kind

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.851 align:middle line:84%
of without going into
conspiracy, there's some money

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.421 align:middle line:84%
that is allocated
towards those business.

00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.489 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of --
we're running after --

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to find solutions to
free ourselves up and it seems

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.964 align:middle line:84%
like money is not even the
real thing to really look at.

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:49.234 align:middle line:84%
It seems like we have something
else inside of us that needs

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:52.171 align:middle line:84%
to be expressed and done
beyond this money kind of --

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:90%
we can't do it because of money.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.076 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:32:57.076 --> 00:32:59.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well yes, I mean
I think partly it's a matter

00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:01.180 align:middle line:84%
of changing our attitudes
and the people who give

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.248 align:middle line:84%
out the money, are
after all, people.

00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:04.983 align:middle line:84%
And their influenced
by what they think

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.719 align:middle line:84%
of as the mainstream
majority view.

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:13.058 align:middle line:84%
If that changes, it will affect
what they spend the money on and

00:33:13.058 --> 00:33:17.362 align:middle line:84%
but one of the things that
is a liberating influence

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:18.964 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:22.701 align:middle line:84%
So we have a political system
that favors the ultra-rich

00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:25.737 align:middle line:90%
and huge business interests.

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:28.841 align:middle line:84%
But there is one fallout from
that which could be good news,

00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:31.477 align:middle line:84%
which is that a lot of
people who are very rich now,

00:33:31.477 --> 00:33:34.446 align:middle line:84%
have so much money they can't
possibly spend it on themselves.

00:33:34.446 --> 00:33:38.217 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once you've got a house
in London, a flat in Paris,

00:33:38.217 --> 00:33:41.286 align:middle line:84%
a yacht in the Mediterranean,
a private jet, and a castle

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:43.622 align:middle line:84%
in Scotland and so on,
and there's a limit

00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:46.792 align:middle line:84%
to how much you can
actually spend on yourself.

00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:49.595 align:middle line:84%
And some people still
have billions left over.

00:33:49.595 --> 00:33:52.898 align:middle line:84%
And almost anything they can
do with that is give it away

00:33:52.898 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:90%
or create foundations.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of
relatively uncommitted money

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:59.138 align:middle line:90%
around at the moment,

00:33:59.138 --> 00:34:03.909 align:middle line:84%
and if some of those people can
be persuaded to direct it in new

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:07.278 align:middle line:84%
and original ways, it
could be a creative force.

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:09.148 align:middle line:90%
I think it's more likely

00:34:09.148 --> 00:34:11.917 align:middle line:84%
that private individuals
who've got more money

00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:16.988 align:middle line:84%
than they know what to do
with, could act as catalysts

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:19.958 align:middle line:84%
for change and governments
who are always having

00:34:19.958 --> 00:34:23.228 align:middle line:84%
to have competing
claims on their funds.

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:26.298 align:middle line:84%
You know, welfare budgets,
health budgets, and so on.

00:34:26.298 --> 00:34:28.267 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
problem for governments

00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:31.637 align:middle line:84%
in how much they can
spend on anything.

00:34:31.637 --> 00:34:34.506 align:middle line:84%
So you know I hope
there'll be creative ways

00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:38.443 align:middle line:84%
in which science can be funded
in a new and more creative way.

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:42.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do you have --
you know, the last question

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:45.083 align:middle line:84%
or the last thing that
you would like to leave us

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.151 align:middle line:84%
with regarding this
book or the work

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:49.988 align:middle line:84%
that you're currently
doing or researching?

00:34:49.988 --> 00:34:52.157 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
that is important

00:34:52.157 --> 00:34:54.793 align:middle line:90%
for you to communicate?

00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:57.563 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: Well, I think
anyone who reads this book,

00:34:57.563 --> 00:35:00.699 align:middle line:84%
"Science Set Free," or it's
called, "The Science Delusion,"

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:07.039 align:middle line:84%
in England, can really help
to be part of this process.

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:09.308 align:middle line:84%
What I do in my book is at
the end of each chapter,

00:35:09.308 --> 00:35:13.345 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask four different
questions which is

00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:16.181 align:middle line:84%
like a do-it-yourself guide of
how you can have discussions

00:35:16.181 --> 00:35:18.183 align:middle line:84%
with your friends, because
all of us have friends

00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
who are militant
atheists, militant skeptics,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.023 align:middle line:90%
militant materialists and so on.

00:35:25.023 --> 00:35:28.493 align:middle line:84%
And usually they claim their
position is based on science.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:32.431 align:middle line:84%
What I do ask questions that
are scientific questions

00:35:32.431 --> 00:35:35.334 align:middle line:84%
that are genuinely hard to
answer questions for anybody.

00:35:35.334 --> 00:35:37.669 align:middle line:84%
These are not rhetorical
questions.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:40.105 align:middle line:84%
They're ones that will
start a real debate.

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:43.842 align:middle line:84%
So really what will
change our society,

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:90%
is people thinking differently.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.014 align:middle line:84%
And this book I hope will help
people to think differently

00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:52.618 align:middle line:84%
about science and
nature and human nature.

00:35:52.618 --> 00:35:55.287 align:middle line:84%
And then also, to help
to catalyze a change

00:35:55.287 --> 00:35:57.789 align:middle line:84%
by discussing it with their
friends who, you know,

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:00.525 align:middle line:84%
when they meet at parties
or when they're having tea

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:03.028 align:middle line:90%
or drinks or dinner or whatever.

00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:06.131 align:middle line:84%
Just chatting with
friends in a way

00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:09.401 align:middle line:84%
that these conversations
can be part of that change.

00:36:09.401 --> 00:36:12.271 align:middle line:84%
So I invite anyone
who's interested

00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:84%
to actually be part
of this change.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And unlock,
start to unlock?

00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sheldrake: Yes, exactly.

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes, because
it's open mind

00:36:19.778 --> 00:36:23.548 align:middle line:84%
or those questions are a way
to open our minds or to free it

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:25.117 align:middle line:84%
and to start thinking a
little bit differently.

00:36:25.117 --> 00:36:26.351 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:36:26.351 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I love your approach and
the work that you have done.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.022 align:middle line:90%
I'm very grateful for it.

00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:33.058 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
Rupert for your time.

00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:34.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Sheldrake: My
pleasure, thank you.

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And big kiss to all

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.396 align:middle line:84%
of you juicy
creators out there.

00:36:37.396 --> 00:36:38.397 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:38.397 --> 00:36:39.598 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have enjoyed
this interview.

00:36:39.598 --> 00:36:42.734 align:middle line:84%
Don't hesitate to comment
underneath and share it.

00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:44.436 align:middle line:84%
Sending you much,
much love from London.

00:36:44.436 --> 00:36:45.771 align:middle line:90%
If you haven't read this book,

00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:47.873 align:middle line:84%
"Science Set Free,"
maybe it's time.

00:36:47.873 --> 00:36:49.941 align:middle line:90%
Big, big kisses.
