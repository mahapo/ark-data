00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Today I'm in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
A little bit different
because I'm in a studio.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But I'm still on the
road, traveling like crazy

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:84%
because I love
interviewing people.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got this passion
for discovering

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
what it takes to
transform our lives.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And today, I have a
very special teacher.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:84%
One that I met many years
ago, actually, through email.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And we connected, but it was not
the time to do this interview.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Today I know we are ready.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
We are ready for
big transformation.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're ready to
really-- and maybe I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't use the
word crap, but it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
is time to really shake
things up and see the truth,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and see what really
spirituality means, what

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:84%
awakening means,
what mysticism is.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I think all of that needs
to be redefined right now.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And this interview is part
of this paradigm shift.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel
what it feels like.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to feel it, you
to feel it in your heart,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in your body, what is
this new teaching about.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a new
era we're in right now,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and it requires new
type of teachers.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm in love, of course, with
so many teachings out there.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think tonight
my guest, that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.795 align:middle line:84%
is the author of "Transforming
Fate Into Destiny," Robert

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Ohotto-- the hotto, hotso.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
My god, I'm so excited
to interview him.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Not only you're so cute,
but he has some very amazing

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.010 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
You're an intuitive
life strategist.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're an author
and you're a radio host.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're just this hot
thing out there bringing

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.112 align:middle line:84%
some information that is truly
potent, that is important.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I know you were trained
by Caroline Myss,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.554 align:middle line:84%
so you went through a
tough training, didn't you?

00:01:58.554 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT OHOTTO: I did, yes.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.447 align:middle line:84%
I come from the school
of Caroline Myss.

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:03.697 align:middle line:84%
Taught with her for many
years at her institute, CMED.

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:06.512 align:middle line:84%
And then got my own book,
and have my own radio show

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and platform, and
just been kicking it.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So let's
start it right in there

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
in this topic of
redefining right now.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
How do you see spirituality,
mysticism, empowerment?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.625 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important
to redefine this now?

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>>OHOTTO: Well, I
think the best way

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:10%
to describe this is by
telling folks what I actually

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:10%
do as an intuitive.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:10%
I'm constantly tracking
the psyche of people.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going into the
psyche, but also referencing

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:10%
the blueprint of
their life purpose.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I call it their soul contract.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.849 align:middle line:84%
And the gift of
all of that for me

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is like being a reporter in
the field of consciousness.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm always witnessing
the movement of people,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the
movement of this field,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the
movement of culture.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:90%
And we are mandalas of energy.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
different sources

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:84%
of energy informing our
self-concept, our esteem,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
our perspectives,
how we make choices.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.312 align:middle line:84%
And the fascinating thing
about this to me is,

00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and that I've
learned, when I think

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
is why we do need
to take a pause

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and kind of do an inventory
even of our own field

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.444 align:middle line:84%
is that there's something
in our culture called shame.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
been running around.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's a shame-based culture.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
That's just the nature of how
our cultural psychic fabric is.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I read people,
I'm always tracking.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I say all the time I become
like a shame tracker.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:84%
I start to see where's
shame in someone's system.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.223 align:middle line:84%
Where is it affecting
perception and choice,

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
self-concept, esteem.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.209 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So shame
of being ourselves?

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Shame of
just, yeah, being alive,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:90%
being a human being.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We kind of come from this
more religious orientation

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're here because
we have original sin

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:90%
or it's a place of banishment.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And then we translate that into
an Eastern shame-based idea

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of karma, where
we've got lifetimes

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that we've got to
work off all this sin.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've really become
very aware and cognizant

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of how that affects people in
their journey in this life.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a new
era emerging right now

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness in this
field, where we have to have,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
actually, a conversation about
the shame of our own field

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and the unconscious level
of it and how, you know--

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There's many well-intentioned
teachers out there.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I can see and
track in people as clients,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and also just watching
other teachers,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.050 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they teach from shame.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.299 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even realize
that's what they're doing.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So it's like
spirituality is used,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:84%
but the same old
thing is behind it.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: It's like
the shame of, let's

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
say, a lot of
religious traditions

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:84%
got transplanted
into metaphysical,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
law of attraction philosophical,
neo-Buddhist language.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So I know you go in
a lot into the shadow work,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.898 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
definitely speak

00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of that-- the shadow work, the
soul esteem, our Buddha nature,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
talking of destiny, and what
is faith versus destiny.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And really, what
does it take to be

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
this free, awesome,
creative, loving human being.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
So how do you see it?

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:90%
What is for you spirituality?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what is awakening?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:90%
What is this now?

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.464 align:middle line:90%
How do you define it?

00:05:03.464 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: My definition
for spirituality

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
actually came to me from a
Native American philosophy

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:90%
course I took in college.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Our professor was
an actual native.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.524 align:middle line:84%
And he brought in an
elder from his tribe.

00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And this elder was
telling us this story

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
about how he'd been beaten
by nuns and priests,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and forced to assimilate into
more of a Christian orientation

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:90%
to spirituality, religion.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And he looked us
all in the eye--

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
and it just went right through
me, growing up Catholic.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.074 align:middle line:90%
It just shook me out.

00:05:30.074 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
know, religion is

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
for people who are afraid
they're going to go to hell.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.514 align:middle line:84%
And spirituality is for people
who have already been there.

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And that just went right through
me because he'd lived it.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.136 align:middle line:84%
You could see it in his
presence and in his energy.

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And he had this power about
him and this kind of luminosity

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:90%
about him.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And that changed my
perspective forever

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.850 align:middle line:84%
about how I saw spirituality,
how I've approach spirituality.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But spirituality to me
is about cultivating

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
things we've probably heard
a lot of-- loving kindness.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And most importantly, presence.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the most powerful
gift we can give each other.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the most powerful
way we can be in the world

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:90%
and connect.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.415 align:middle line:84%
If you're not here, I
can't connect with you.

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
If you're somewhere else,
I can't connect with you.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's not about perfection.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about showing
up with all of what--

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I call it your flawsomeness.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like flaw plus awesome.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
We're flawesome.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
things that are never

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:90%
going to probably be fixed.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.669 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
we create okayness,

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I think, the more
that we can actually

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
unfold into a
conscious spirituality.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.181 align:middle line:84%
Because spirituality
is everything.

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
All is one, all is of
God, all is the divine.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
difference is what's

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
in a conscious way of
being awakened in it.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And that to me is
a spiritual path,

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're actively
conscious and working it.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.765 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's on
a spiritual path.

00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I kind of
look at it this way--

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Whether
you know it or not?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah,
because we're all God.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true, then
everything is spiritual.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
how awake you are in it.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think we
look at the difference also

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.312 align:middle line:90%
between purpose and destiny.

00:07:04.312 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's living
purpose all the time.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Purpose is life.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But destiny's a conscious
engagement with purpose.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I think we have this
fluffy idea of spirituality

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and love, when it's really
powerful and really requires,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.564 align:middle line:90%
as you say, presence.

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And
presence meaning you

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
are in your body, in the
moment, on the planet.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I think we
have to redefine mysticism.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I think the old
idea of mysticism

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.655 align:middle line:84%
was about transcendence of life
or getting out of karmic debt

00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have
to reincarnate.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I've always joked
that I think by the time

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.342 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point where
you can't wait to get back

00:07:38.342 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to Earth school, that's
probably when you

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:90%
don't have to come here anymore.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Because this is God.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
This idea that somehow this
isn't a real universe--

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:90%
it's real.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhist idea of illusion is
that this just isn't permanent.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no permanence here,
but it is still just as real.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph Campbell
was known for saying

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
if you don't find eternity here,
you're not finding it anywhere.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Because this is it.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the moment.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the moment of awakening.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So this whole
idea of paradise and hell

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
is basically an illusion
that we're trapped into

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:90%
or we can be trapped into.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: It's a
mental polarity.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I think
in our spiritual traditions

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
and the teachers
before me, there's

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.570 align:middle line:90%
a lot of focus on the mind.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of neurotic
because we say-- in Buddhism,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
there's this idea that
you're not your thoughts.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just clouds
passing through the sky.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
Then you turn to the
next metaphysical book

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and it's you are what you
think, you are what you think.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:90%
So change your thoughts.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:90%
Change your life.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.095 align:middle line:90%
Where do you go?

00:08:37.095 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
there's this neurosis,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.729 align:middle line:90%
this pole between these ideas.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in the middle
I think is the truth.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is
something that is

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
processed in this part of you.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It's in your heart, and
it's in the compassion,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and the unconditional
capacity to be

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
present to your life and
the moment as it arrives.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's a major shift
because to trust ourselves

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.391 align:middle line:84%
and to follow that truth inside
is not how we've been raised,

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
We've been waiting for
signs outside of us,

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.535 align:middle line:84%
whereas the shift is
really here, isn't it?

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It's like
I am this barometer.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:10.944 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:09:10.944 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I've seen
intuitively in people

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.985 align:middle line:84%
is there's a way
you can actually

00:09:13.985 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
pray that pulls you from your
power and out of the moment.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.384 align:middle line:84%
People pray for their
soulmates, right?

00:09:20.384 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course, as an
intuitive, people

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
come to me for the usual
suspects-- career guidance,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
love guidance, life purpose
guidance, spiritual guidance,

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
healing, understanding why
they keep self-sabotaging.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a rich and I
think sacred place for me

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:90%
to hold to be in that space.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But what I've seen is
people come up here

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:90%
and try to do the work.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually not
where the shift will happen.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
What happens up here-- by the
time your mind is ruminating,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and polarized, and thinking
in terms of either/or,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
should or shouldn't,
you've left here.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.665 align:middle line:90%
You've shut your heart down.

00:09:56.665 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And to sink back here is where
your shift will happen here.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure everybody can relate
to relationships you finally

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:90%
had to let go of.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And you came to that
knowing about it.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
You ruminate up here,
and go back and forth.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And I got to get out
of this relationship.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:10.565 align:middle line:90%
Should I leave?

00:10:10.565 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:90%
Shouldn't it?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
What if?

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you finally come
to that surrender point,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
but that's here, where
there's just a knowing.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And once you leave knowing
and you go into either/or,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.501 align:middle line:90%
you've left your intuition.

00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:90%
You're out of intuition.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is a knowing and
a discernment of knowing.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting when people
think of the concept of choice.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's not
right or wrong choices.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
There's only the
choice that's true.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that can be and needs

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:90%
to be organic and in the moment.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Not a formulaic concept
of what's right or wrong

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:90%
or what should I choose.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Your guidance system
intuitively knows.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
It references what I call your
soul contract, that blueprint,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.217 align:middle line:84%
and says, OK, this is
where I must turn left,

00:10:55.217 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:90%
this is where I must turn right.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.425 align:middle line:90%
There's no either or.

00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:90%
There's just turn left.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
next way that I need go.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And It doesn't opt you out
of pain, suffering, loss,

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
challenge.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
We are all are
going to experience

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that as human beings.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.189 align:middle line:84%
So turning left, personal
guidance, and intuition,

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think
well, that's supposed

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.160 align:middle line:84%
to be path that I
don't suffer on.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:84%
No, that's the path
sometimes that you

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.757 align:middle line:84%
suffer more because it
summons the soul in some way.

00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We're definitely going
to get in the practical aspect

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
because this is super
important to really descend

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or at least to start
incarnating that

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and to put that in practice.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.530 align:middle line:84%
One little last thing regarding
these old paradigm teachers.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
things to watch for?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Just before we go into the
intuition, and the soul work,

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and the shadow work.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I would like to just
discuss so that we

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
know what are some
of the little things

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to watch for that
is a sign that it's

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
old paradigm versus something
that is really going to nurture

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.497 align:middle line:84%
our soul, that is going
to help us to thrive.

00:11:52.497 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: First, I
want to just define

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
old paradigm as something
that says you're not OK.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.272 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, some way, insidiously,
unconsciously perhaps,

00:12:01.272 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
but says there's
something wrong with you

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.355 align:middle line:84%
that needs fixed before you're
good enough, before you're

00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
OK enough, for
destiny to happen.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:90%
That's actually all an illusion.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
shame-driven illusion.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you step out of that,
the new paradigm is hey,

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm already OK.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true, how
do I reveal my beauty?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that as a
teacher, it's about me saying,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.110 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't have the key to fix you.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I have the key to reveal you
because you're already enough.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.131 align:middle line:90%
So come over here.

00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Come to these teachings.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So first thing,
teachings that are

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:84%
about the revelation
of the innate

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:84%
okayness that's already
there, the innate worth that's

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:90%
already there.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Teachings that say do
this, do that formula.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Shame the ego,
that's very popular.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.325 align:middle line:84%
Let's shame the ego,
the ego's wrong.

00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:90%
It's bad.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.830 align:middle line:90%
We got to get rid of it.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you as a
technician of the psyche

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that the ego's not
going anywhere.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a necessary
part of how we're

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
meant to engage and
create in the world.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm Robert Ohotto.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:90%
You're Lilou Mace.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.847 align:middle line:90%
And that is necessary.

00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:84%
If you get rid of all of that,
then we're just floating around

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:90%
and there's not a lot to do.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So the soul contract
is, in fact,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:84%
to be in some container of
identity while you're here.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is not
making it the center

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of your consciousness as
if it's the only thing that

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:90%
runs the reality.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you find teachings
that are shaming the ego,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
telling you need to
get rid of something,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that's shame talking.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.035 align:middle line:84%
And so what's interesting when
we talk about mysticism is

00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that mysticism is really, the
way I see it, we incarnate.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:84%
We come through these--
Earth is a matrix of energy.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a living energy
pattern, the school here.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.310 align:middle line:90%
And there are cycles of time.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
There's archetypal
energies that we fuse into,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
per our soul
contract, to be here.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:90%
So I was born in Colorado.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm an American.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I am white.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I am 6 foot 1.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I come from an alcoholic
and abusive home.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
These are all coordinates
of my journey.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So that is something my soul
chose as a journey of purpose.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But when I leave, do
those things come with me?

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But it must serve
some trajectory

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm here to do.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: So it's agreed.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: This is fate.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
This is your fate.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the contract
you make with fate.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Destiny becomes--
it's like getting

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:90%
dealt a certain hand of cards.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do with that hand?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to reference this--

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.310 align:middle line:84%
not the shame-ridden,
crazy mind-- but this

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
on how to make the next
step, the next move?

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's not perfect.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It's practice, because I
certainly don't got it down.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
But what I've seen
people, when it

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
comes to your original
question about the teachings

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and what to look
out for, you want

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
to be very aware of anything
that's making your wrong

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.666 align:middle line:84%
or telling you to
get rid of stuff

00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.042 align:middle line:90%
or that you need to be fixed.

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:47.625 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: When you
feel bad, basically.

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:90%
You need to feel good.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I've seen
the shaming of the ego,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen also the
shaming of the soul.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
There's literature out
there that tells you

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.055 align:middle line:84%
your soul's messed up and that's
why you keep reincarnating.

00:14:56.055 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah,
what's up with that?

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.705 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I mean, if we
can't go to the soul,

00:14:58.705 --> 00:14:59.830 align:middle line:90%
where are we going?

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.466 align:middle line:84%
Where do you go if the soul
itself is already messed up?

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.625 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: If it's
like the soul is here

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to burn off lifetimes of--
and the fascinating thing is

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:84%
mysticism, though,
is you journey

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:90%
toward this essence of self.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:90%
We're celestial beings.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:84%
On, if you will, the other
side, there isn't shame.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
That is an earth condition,
that is an earth pattern

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that we do fuse with
when we're here.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.156 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I've seen
people do with spirituality

00:15:33.156 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:90%
is they work on themselves.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They wake up.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And then people, the
seekers that watch shows

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.390 align:middle line:84%
like this, of which
I'm also one of them.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.025 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken this journey with
shame and journey of everything

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:46.172 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
just like everybody else,

00:15:46.172 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:90%
even though I have a unique--

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We're all
in this together.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:49.909 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Amen.

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Amen, sister.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.866 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I'm clear
about that one.

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:53.405 align:middle line:90%
And it's never ending, right?

00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
okayness is important.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And the mystical
journey for me is about

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
beginning to
understand and let go

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.160 align:middle line:90%
of the illusory layer of shame.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the final frontier to
me in this field, is shame.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And the shame filter that's
used to even perceive

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the teachings in this field,
and teach from in this field,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
is very pervasive.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing that
I've become a very good,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
a very active activist about,
because I grew up the kid that

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.406 align:middle line:84%
was bullied on the
playground and made fun of.

00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And growing up gay
was also a big part

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
of my own journey of
understanding shame and all

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:33.959 align:middle line:90%
these different pieces.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.375 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was born
out of the womb

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:36.999 align:middle line:84%
and partnered up
with shame right away

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:90%
in a shame-based culture.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is something I'm
very, very familiar with

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very sensitive to.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I see
that going around,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
to say something.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.477 align:middle line:84%
But my own awakening
with it took some time

00:16:48.477 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of spirituality
and self-help, too.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:84%
There's books that
I could pull off

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.115 align:middle line:84%
the shelf that I read in 1999
and I'm like, man, in 1999,

00:16:54.115 --> 00:16:54.865 align:middle line:90%
this was the bomb.

00:16:54.865 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:90%
I loved this book.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:90%
This rocked my world.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Now I read it and I
can see deep passages

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
of shame-based thinking,
of shame-based ideas

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.240 align:middle line:90%
of the soul and the ego.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: When this soul contract
happens on this other plane,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
you kind of agree with some
different souls, right?

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the role each other we're
going to play so that, what?

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's the goal
of this little meeting?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
To then, down on the earth--
What's the ultimate goal, then,

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of living, of being here, of
being in this earth school?

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Well, the
thing is that that I

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.465 align:middle line:84%
think the real
answer to that, we

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
can't answer with
the human mind.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.615 align:middle line:84%
We'll never really
answer that adequately

00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:90%
enough with the human mind.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I think the heart
can answer that.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's certain things
in terms of soul and spirit,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysics, and
spirituality, and the soul

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that we just have to kind of
lean in here to make sense of.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.636 align:middle line:84%
Because we can look at
this-- this world and there's

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pain and suffering,
and a lot of-- man, people

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
doing some really nasty
stuff to each other.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.000 align:middle line:90%
And we just think why bother?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:90%
What are we even doing here?

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty horrific,
some of this stuff.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you turn the corner
and you see something amazing.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And someone swoops in
with an act of grace

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:84%
or an act of service
out of nowhere

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and saves somebody's life
or helps somebody out

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:90%
as a stranger.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, oh
yeah, I feel it here.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
something here.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that my sense, if I
can language it the best I can,

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:90%
is that we are here to evolve.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
There's some sort of
evolutionary process

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:90%
the soul is very vested in.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.210 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't exactly answer that.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But I can say that there
is some sort of awakening,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
or experience and growth, and
continual, ongoing, nonstop,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
infinite evolution that
this part of me and you

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.444 align:middle line:90%
is completely down with.

00:18:43.444 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It feels
like there's something

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to the extent of being
more and more free, as

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:84%
free-- in the real
sense of being free.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And let that spiritual,
unlimited, loving part

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves shine out.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Just be, really.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.253 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah, it's
about just being.

00:19:01.253 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
can maybe position it

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in terms of choices made-- I
always look at it this way.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
You wake up every day
and you get the choice

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to honor the truth all is
one from your choices or not.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And not that it's
that dualistic,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's a good way to
simplify and say, well,

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
does this choice
honor all is one?

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always
as it appears.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to honor
all is one with an addict,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
give them more heroin.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Even though they're going
through a horrific withdrawal,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:90%
you're going to say no heroin.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.758 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
get out of this, buddy.

00:19:27.758 --> 00:19:28.955 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing this.

00:19:28.955 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:90%
This is done.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
choose the mystical path.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to choose your soul

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to die.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes the
choice that honors

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.089 align:middle line:84%
all is one on the surface
might not not look very nice

00:19:39.089 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
or feel nice, and people
might not appreciate it.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But you have to hold the higher
perspective and the higher

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:90%
space for that person.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:48.624 align:middle line:84%
And you can extrapolate
from that example

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
to many people in your life.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes setting a
boundary with somebody

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and saying no is the
most loving thing

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll ever do for
them and yourself.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Obstacles.

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We have obstacles
in our lives, things

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.624 align:middle line:84%
that don't go exactly
how we would like them--

00:20:01.624 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: We do?

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.802 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: --how we feel.

00:20:03.802 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Really?

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.426 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:20:05.426 --> 00:20:05.926 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:05.926 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We all know exactly
what that is.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with that?

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Are some obstacles
not really obstacles?

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Are some obstacles
part of our destiny?

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Some are really just things
that we need to heal?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:84%
How would you even
work this out?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I think
that's interesting

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people, because
of shame, will see an obstacle

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.299 align:middle line:84%
and think that there's
something wrong with them.

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
There's an obstacle
that shouldn't be here.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.806 align:middle line:90%
This shouldn't be here.

00:20:30.806 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Any time we're in should
or shouldn't, shame.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.790 align:middle line:84%
You want to track that and go,
OK, I'm speaking from shame.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But obstacle's a part
of the destined path.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I kind of look at it from
a few different places.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.781 align:middle line:84%
I think there's creative
obstacles that are there

00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
to help summon in you a
character, edify character

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
in you, build muscles for the
other stuff you're here to do

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:90%
and create and lift.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that those
are necessary.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I know in my life I've had
numerous obstacles that

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
were like that that kind of
prepared me for the next level.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear about
something about destiny.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Destiny is always going to
be connected to service.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
self-realization

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
for your own narcissistic desire
of finally self-realizing.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
What's that going to serve?

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.859 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's about
summoning and really

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
bringing forward and
coming out with what's

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
most unique and
amazing about you.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:90%
And so obstacles will do that.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
They will push you and get you
strong enough and fortified

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:84%
enough so that you can go
to the next level of what

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
you're destined for.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.696 align:middle line:84%
But there's also fated
redirection obstacles.

00:21:34.696 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're gonna
talk about that.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I saw
your YouTube video.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.915 align:middle line:90%
I saw that.

00:21:37.915 --> 00:21:38.068 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: I know.

00:21:38.068 --> 00:21:39.151 align:middle line:90%
We got to talk about that.

00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes in this culture--
let me give you an example.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
The shows like "American
Idol" and "The Voice."

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.451 align:middle line:84%
And people go and try out
for these shows, right?

00:21:47.451 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And they go and they
sing, but they can't sing.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
So I always got curious.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Why are you even
going to this show

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and auditioning when
you can't even sing?

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't have that talent.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not your destiny.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's something I think
we all do in our own way.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:90%
We chase someone else's dream.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:84%
We chase something
else that looks shiny,

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
or that we think
will fill a hole,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:84%
or give us the value that
we don't feel we have.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I lived in LA for a year.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember running
into and meeting

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of actors
and aspiring actors

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
who were chasing validation
and being seen because when

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:90%
they were kids, no one saw them.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
No one gave them that
sense of specialness

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
or empowered them
with hey, I see you.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:90%
You're awesome.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So they go and they
have to super size it.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: And others see that.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Others see it.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:90%
We see that.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
We see that
inauthenticity in them.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.725 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And then if they
get some fame or something,

00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:90%
it usually kills them.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.061 align:middle line:84%
They end up in their addictions,
and it takes them out.

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that I would
say about fated redirections,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
though, is that they're
obstacles that say hey, stop.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:90%
This is not your path, man.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got to turn
left, turn right.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Go somewhere else.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.975 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example of LA.

00:22:53.975 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I was writing my book,
"Transforming Fate Into

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Destiny," at the time
I was living in LA.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And I would have this schedule
where I would do readings

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.520 align:middle line:84%
during the day, go
hike Runyon Canyon,

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
which is at the base side of
where I lived at the time.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And there was this guy
that had this cart there,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%
sitting outside the canyon.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.150 align:middle line:90%
And he was selling water.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I lived right in
this condo right there,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.103 align:middle line:84%
so I never needed
to really buy water.

00:23:17.103 --> 00:23:19.594 align:middle line:84%
But I'm curious about
people as an intuitive.

00:23:19.594 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You just get curious
about people.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
read somebody, I

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.510 align:middle line:84%
feel like I'm getting some
new download of perspective

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.474 align:middle line:84%
around what soul
contracts actually are

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and what our
destinies really are.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a never ending, kind
of curious field for me.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
But I happened to be
walking one day past him.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And he had this headshot
of himself on his cart.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And above it, it said,
shamelessly seeking agent.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So he's looking for an
agent, right, to rep him.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I took one look at him
one day and I I thought,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.870 align:middle line:84%
dude, you are on
the wrong path, man.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:84%
This is not going
to work for you.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Not that he didn't have
the actor archetype per se.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But what trumped that for
him was he had the teacher.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel in his
field this love for kids.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I decided-- and I
had just done reading ratings

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.065 align:middle line:84%
and my intuitive antenna
was just still up,

00:24:05.065 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and I usually go walk
to bring that down.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.932 align:middle line:90%
And I just whisped into him.

00:24:08.932 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I have to
go buy water from him.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I got to go talk to this guy.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:14.889 align:middle line:84%
The divine is summoning
me to this encounter,

00:24:14.889 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:90%
this synchronicity.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I went over to him and I
said hey, what's going on?

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.910 align:middle line:90%
And he was horribly unhappy.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:90%
He looked terrible.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.636 align:middle line:90%
He just looked drained of life.

00:24:26.636 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Long story short,
I said, so what

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.426 align:middle line:84%
are you going to do if this
acting thing doesn't work out?

00:24:30.426 --> 00:24:32.937 align:middle line:84%
And I had tracked in him
this fabulous teacher.

00:24:32.937 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sort of
impression, intuitive

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
impression, of him teaching
kids in high school drama.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I've been
thinking about maybe going back

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to college or school
and becoming a teacher.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.269 align:middle line:90%
And I went, hello.

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
that's exactly what I

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.018 align:middle line:90%
would do if I were you.

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:48.334 align:middle line:90%
I said, you would enjoy it.

00:24:48.334 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:90%
You'd get to do your acting.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You'd get to do the drama, but
you get to engage the kids.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And you get to be you in the
way that you were destined.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How did
you know intuitively

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that that was the
thing he was meant for?

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.110 align:middle line:90%
What were the signs?

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.389 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel?

00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: It's just the
way that my wiring works.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just kind of
see that in people.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.083 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:07.722 align:middle line:84%
But we want to know
how does it feel

00:25:07.722 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
intuitive, right?

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Right.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's
intuitive, absolutely.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about recognizing the
stuff that you innately,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:90%
genuinely have a passion for.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to supersize it.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't think, well, if I can't
be Brad Pitt, I shouldn't act.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Or if I can't be Martha
Stewart, I shouldn't cook.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
If I can't be Oprah
Winfrey, I shouldn't

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:90%
do some sort of talk show.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to go with
what your lane is,

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.656 align:middle line:84%
what your passions are,
and follow that through

00:25:37.656 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
because that's-- the
gods rise to meet you.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Doors open.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.316 align:middle line:84%
For me, doors -- this path for
me, I wanted to be an actor.

00:25:44.316 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:90%
That was my original thing.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was a theater major, then
I studied psych in college.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I can see that.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And then, as you
know, I studied French.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oui.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Oui.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
different ambition.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
All the while, I was using tools
like metaphysics, intuition,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:84%
archetypal depth psychology,
Joseph Campbell's

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.062 align:middle line:90%
mythology studies.

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff to
understand myself

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.228 align:middle line:84%
so I could figure out
how to be an actor.

00:26:07.228 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And the gods tricked me.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know, Caroline
Myss was taking me under wing.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting launched.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.338 align:middle line:90%
All this stuff happens.

00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:90%
I didn't never plan it.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:90%
I never planed that.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And then at some
point, you recognize

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have the skill set,
something unique, that you're

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.210 align:middle line:90%
born to do and give people.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
let the rest happen.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.635 align:middle line:90%
I was scouted to write a book.

00:26:25.635 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a manuscript.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.180 align:middle line:90%
That's unheard of.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.790 align:middle line:90%
That is completely unheard of.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.649 align:middle line:84%
Hay House and Random
House both contacted me

00:26:31.649 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:84%
at the same exact time within
three weeks of each other

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.981 align:middle line:90%
to write a book for them.

00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:90%
And I hadn't written anything.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.402 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: The book.

00:26:37.402 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.908 align:middle line:84%
It has materialized from
the unseen to the seen.

00:26:40.908 --> 00:26:41.574 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: It is.

00:26:41.574 --> 00:26:42.074 align:middle line:90%
It was born.

00:26:42.074 --> 00:26:44.394 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It was born, because
it's like that, isn't it?

00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: It is.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.439 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It goes from the unseen
to physically manifesting.

00:26:50.439 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Are things created-- let's
talk just for a second

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.750 align:middle line:84%
on a little thing about
the law of attraction.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.915 align:middle line:84%
Just a little thing,
because you say

00:26:57.915 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:90%
it was hijacked by capitalism.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the little
touch on that,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:90%
how things manifest in reality.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.207 align:middle line:90%
What does really happen?

00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: There's something
called the law of attraction

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
that I feel is very real in
our experience of being alive.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think what we-- because
we're a mental culture,

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:14.790 align:middle line:90%
we want.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I think
we want to go to the mind

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.290 align:middle line:84%
is because we feel like then
life becomes more controllable.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So if I can think
something into being,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.740 align:middle line:84%
well, that makes me feel
like I'm in control.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.277 align:middle line:84%
And if we just started to
get real with ourselves, how

00:27:27.277 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:90%
true is that really?

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.549 align:middle line:84%
How many people are right now
terrified to be on an airplane,

00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:33.840 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's going to crash,
and nothing's falling out

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.222 align:middle line:90%
of the sky?

00:27:35.222 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad we're not
that powerful, frankly,

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
because if I went to my
thoughts and started immediately

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.356 align:middle line:84%
manifesting out of there,
it would be a nightmare,

00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I always tell everyone your
experience will forever

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:90%
be your best teacher.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was 19--
because I started

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.046 align:middle line:84%
studying all this
stuff very young

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and was just innately wired
to go toward the light,

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:84%
if you will, and go toward all
this knowledge and philosophy.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I had a vision board
at 19, and I'm 41.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
This is well before
all this stuff blew up.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I used to put
on my vision board

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.627 align:middle line:84%
to win the lottery so I could
be an environmentalist rescuer.

00:28:09.627 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I was going to use
millions of dollars

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.293 align:middle line:90%
to rescue the environment.

00:28:12.293 --> 00:28:14.109 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even making this up.

00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I hope so.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.243 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Right?

00:28:15.243 --> 00:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: New paradigm--
truth authenticity.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.445 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: You know, I
didn't win the lottery.

00:28:18.445 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I did not manifest the lottery.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And good on me for it
because, I'll tell you,

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't my destiny.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't trump what
your contract's already

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.550 align:middle line:90%
been written for.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, people
are taking, ironically,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
a wounded sense of lack
to this law of attraction

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.604 align:middle line:90%
and trying to fill holes.

00:28:37.604 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would be the
worst thing for them

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.540 align:middle line:84%
for the universe
say OK, here you go.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:42.762 align:middle line:90%
You're going to manifest it.

00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it'd be better
to say, you know,

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to align with what I
was born to do and be in life.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to,
first of all, align

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
with just core worthiness.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.407 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get that going.

00:28:54.407 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
law of attraction

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
works in more dynamic ways than
just focusing on positivism

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:90%
because we have a shadow.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have contracts with
people to shadow dance.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
We have contracts with
people to be shaken up

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
into our unconscious
pain and how

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we make choices of
self-sabotage unconsciously.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.207 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it'd be
great if we could just--

00:29:17.207 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's
also ironic about that,

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:84%
too, is, you know, when the
book "The Secret" came out,

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:84%
it was around the same time our
economy in the United States

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.239 align:middle line:90%
completely shattered.

00:29:26.239 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always kept
thinking to myself, well,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.840 align:middle line:84%
where are all the
manifesters out there that

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
have bought millions
of copies of this book?

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.276 align:middle line:84%
Where's all this
abundance that we're

00:29:33.276 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be manifesting?

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was nowhere because
the technicalities of it

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:90%
don't work that way.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:42.980 align:middle line:84%
There's greater
forces than our mind,

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and greater forces than
the ego's mental field

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.631 align:middle line:84%
that really are
running the show.

00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:52.006 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So really, if it's
not part of the soul contract

00:29:52.006 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:84%
or it's not good for
our soul kind of thing,

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.930 align:middle line:90%
it won't manifest.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Law of attraction
or not, it's just--

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And I also say
this, another level of it

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:84%
too that I learned-- and
I'm all for vision boards.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I think they're awesome.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.430 align:middle line:84%
They're a great way to kind
of-- Sometimes what you'll

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:84%
do is you'll put
up there something

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that's part of
your soul contract.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it happens,
and then people mistake

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:90%
that as they made it happen.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.533 align:middle line:84%
But what they really
did was they just

00:30:12.533 --> 00:30:14.000 align:middle line:90%
projected it onto the board.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they aligned with
it, and then it manifested.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they think,
well, I did that.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.690 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty narcissistic,
because-- I'm sorry.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I didn't create the sun.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't create the planets
and the movement around sun.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not keeping gravity.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.466 align:middle line:84%
My mind ain't doing anything
with gravity right now,

00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:90%
but we're still in these chairs.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But the other side of it
too is where vision boards

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.866 align:middle line:84%
can become very powerful, is
I always think, well, whatever

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
you put on your vision board,
ask yourself this question.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a good way to
go to the shadow.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.190 align:middle line:84%
What would it take in me to
change to have that in my life?

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you put on there soulmate,
awesome relationship, marriage,

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
well, you better get
ready to also engage

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the core, raw
vulnerability it's going

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
to take to be in a relationship
that nourishes you that way.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You better be ready to risk
trust and opening yourself

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.735 align:middle line:84%
to somebody because that's
also going to get animated

00:31:05.735 --> 00:31:06.690 align:middle line:90%
and energized.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it work
that way for people, too.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.790 align:middle line:84%
They'll put something
on a vision board

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost
like throwing down

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
the gauntlet of
transformation and saying,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.832 align:middle line:84%
I want that in my life,
and the cosmos going,

00:31:16.832 --> 00:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't even be able
to know how to let that in.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So get ready,
because we're going

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to start an alchemical
journey where

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.076 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to transform.

00:31:24.076 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Ooh la la.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the shadow work.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: That's
shadow work, yeah.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So we have
to go through it.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.218 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: You do.

00:31:29.218 --> 00:31:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: No escape.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I think we're
masters at defending

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:90%
against facing our pain.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm right there with everybody.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.775 align:middle line:84%
I did an intensive
online course.

00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:44.983 align:middle line:84%
I have one, actually, called
Discovering Your Destiny

00:31:44.983 --> 00:31:45.610 align:middle line:90%
in the Shadow.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, people
can run away from--

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and we do emotional bypasses all
the time, even in this field.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.364 align:middle line:84%
That's why we don't want to
feel anything that feels bad.

00:31:54.364 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm feeling bad, well,
just think I feel good.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.094 align:middle line:90%
That's a bypass.

00:31:58.094 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Affirmations.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.301 align:middle line:90%
So you don't like affirmations.

00:32:00.301 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: That feeling
is intuitive data.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Emotions are intuitive data.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.887 align:middle line:84%
So if you follow them, hang
out with them long enough,

00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:07.970 align:middle line:84%
they'll guide you to where
they're emanating from.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the dragon
that needs loved, hugged.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.881 align:middle line:84%
And there's the treasure
behind the dragon.

00:32:11.881 --> 00:32:14.010 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Technically speaking,
I can tell you

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
as an intuitive, that is just
how the human psyche works.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The more that you try to
defend against that process,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:90%
the more you inflame the dragon.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The more that the
shadow gets even darker.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And then there's
a dark night of the soul?

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:31.500 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I call it the
dark night of the ego.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I do, because what's
dark for your soul?

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the immortal,
omniscient, ultrasensory--

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Old paradigm, again.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:90%
You see, I just popped it out.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: New paradigm, baby.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: All right.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Time to change.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Update.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.263 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Dark night of the ego.

00:32:43.263 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The ego is the part of you
that's going through the shift.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It's that whatever you've
created as an identity.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I consider we all
have a soul schedule.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you're born, you
make this whole contract.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not just this
static blueprint.

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:90%
It is a verb.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:90%
There's timing in it.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.890 align:middle line:84%
We live and manifest purpose
through cycles of time.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're scheduled for
dark nights of the ego.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.389 align:middle line:84%
And what that is is it's
kind of like the archetype

00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:90%
of the crucifixion.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Some part of you
that is now getting

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in the way of your
light must now

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:90%
be sacrificed on that cross.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And that could be-- people have
shadow loyalties, I call it.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.010 align:middle line:84%
As much as we might hate
our pain and suffering,

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.870 align:middle line:84%
we can be very loyal to it
and the pain and suffering

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
of our family and
of our parents.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So people will oftentimes feel
like-- unconsciously, I'll

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.140 align:middle line:84%
attract this-- I
can't be happier

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.792 align:middle line:90%
than my mom or dad were.

00:33:38.792 --> 00:33:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you get to that
edge where you just

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.120 align:middle line:84%
might get more nourishment than
they did, more potential going,

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.500 align:middle line:90%
well, you step back.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You do something
to yourself or you

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.420 align:middle line:84%
make a choice, albeit
perhaps pseudo-unconsciously,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.890 align:middle line:84%
to sabotage yourself
back into status quo

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't leave the
orbit of the family lineage.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: A little question
regarding past life regressions

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.424 align:middle line:90%
or things.

00:34:01.424 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that important
in this lifetime

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to really look at those?

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Or are we automatically
going to encounter

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:84%
those obstacles and these
challenges and this dark night

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.476 align:middle line:84%
to launch a better
part of ourself?

00:34:11.476 --> 00:34:12.809 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: I think both are true.

00:34:12.809 --> 00:34:14.809 align:middle line:84%
What I think about past
life regression overall,

00:34:14.809 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
though, is that our bodies carry
memory of our literal lineage,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.912 align:middle line:84%
family-wise and heritage-wise
of our ancestors.

00:34:21.912 --> 00:34:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times when people
do past life regression, what

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.290 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
doing is they're

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.800 align:middle line:84%
going through holographic
cellular memory.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not even a past life.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.288 align:middle line:84%
It's the imagery
and the perspective

00:34:31.288 --> 00:34:32.454 align:middle line:90%
is that this is a past life.

00:34:32.454 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine if you want
to think of it that way.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.100 align:middle line:84%
What's more important
is the information.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.122 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the deal.

00:34:37.122 --> 00:34:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been murdered I
don't know how many times.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I probably had my head cut off.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
Probably was burned at I
don't know how many stakes,

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:90%
you know what I'm saying?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.351 align:middle line:84%
So I don't walk around
itchy, and feeling

00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:84%
like I'm burning, and have
throat problems, and things

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I need to regress
back to release.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.030 align:middle line:90%
So we've all been murdered.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.460 align:middle line:84%
If we get into
reincarnation here,

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.920 align:middle line:84%
we've all bit the dust
probably 1,000 different ways.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we all, while walking
around, needing to kind unravel

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:90%
that all the time?

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that the reason why
some people do have that

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.080 align:middle line:84%
is just as a soul contract
reminder for the rest of us

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.320 align:middle line:84%
that hey, this
isn't the only life.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.689 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see a past
life regressionist.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.104 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
write books about this

00:35:11.104 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:84%
just to remind you very simply
this isn't the only life.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think there
are, that said,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:84%
energies, lessons, if you
want to call them that,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
from our past lives that
we do come here to evolve.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think fix or
necessarily even work on

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.050 align:middle line:84%
is the right word, that you
have to watch that shame factor.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But we're here to evolve
and it's a process.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes people
are regressing

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.814 align:middle line:84%
stuff that happened
to their grandparents.

00:35:37.814 --> 00:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not even actually a past
life in terms of their soul,

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's the memory
in their cell tissue.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Your body is like
a bank of memories.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What are
some of the things?

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
How can we know that
actually we're on destiny

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.164 align:middle line:90%
or we're experiencing destiny?

00:35:56.164 --> 00:35:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Well, we're
always on purpose,

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
so you can't help
but be on purpose.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.329 align:middle line:84%
And I think of destiny
in terms of flow charts.

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've seen the
movie "The Adjustment Bureau"

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.536 align:middle line:90%
with Matt Damon.

00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:09.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like he makes a choice.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I swear someone hacked my
mind and made that movie

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually how it
works from my perspective.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:90%
You make choices.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.440 align:middle line:84%
They flow chart out into
other possibilities.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And your soul contract's
still your soul contract,

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.672 align:middle line:84%
but this is where
you have free will.

00:36:22.672 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Because we do have free will.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:90%
We actually do have choice.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I think part of my work of late,
and my intention in my work,

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
is to help people
cultivate conscious choice.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Conscious choice.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Not compulsive, not reactive,
not addictive, but hey,

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to choose.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to choose the
choice that's true from here.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:84%
But whenever you
do that, you are

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:84%
at the top potential
of your destiny.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.259 align:middle line:84%
When you choose from
here, guide from here.

00:36:52.259 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: The heart?

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.015 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: The heart, yeah.

00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So there's
some wisdom there, huh?

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.465 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:36:56.465 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's not accessed mentally.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Its accessed more
from the feeling body.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:90%
You sink into it.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
You feel the truth.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.920 align:middle line:90%
You feel answers.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You feel the next step.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.457 align:middle line:84%
And if you're jammed
up emotionally,

00:37:09.457 --> 00:37:11.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't know how to
be with your feelings,

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:12.748 align:middle line:84%
this is where you
have to begin, is

00:37:12.748 --> 00:37:15.050 align:middle line:84%
in that emotional decompression
and emotional kind

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:19.467 align:middle line:84%
of release of letting feelings
be OK, no matter what they are.

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Because they transmute.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
They can transmute really fast,
don't they, and transform.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.543 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: If you
just let it be, yeah.

00:37:24.543 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And you get guided to
what-- Feelings to me

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are always a cry from
something unconscious in you.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Like anger.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.259 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm mad or if
I'm pissed off, well,

00:37:32.259 --> 00:37:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that's saying something
like, hey, you know what?

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Someone just violated me.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.434 align:middle line:84%
I've got some unresolved
thing here going on.

00:37:39.434 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Instead of shaming myself
for being an angry person,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:84%
what if I just said
cool, I'm angry.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be with this
because I'm curious about this.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Where is this coming from in me?

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
let that ventilate,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:90%
then it takes you somewhere.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:54.201 align:middle line:84%
And you get guided from there
as to hey, you know what?

00:37:54.201 --> 00:37:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they did just violate you.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.108 align:middle line:84%
You better set a
boundary next time

00:37:57.108 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
or right now so that
you feel you can recover

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:84%
your power in whatever
way you're guided to.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We didn't
talk about fate,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.095 align:middle line:84%
though this is the biggest word
on this cover I've noticed.

00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Fate?

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how do we
transform fate into destiny?

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.490 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between those two?

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Well,
fate to me is kind

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.420 align:middle line:90%
of the set up your soul chose.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, now that
I'm here, you're here.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.740 align:middle line:84%
You were born in France
and you were born--

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: In the US.

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: You were
born in the US, right.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: French parents.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.618 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Right.

00:38:25.618 --> 00:38:26.056 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:26.056 --> 00:38:26.556 align:middle line:90%
Bad example.

00:38:26.556 --> 00:38:28.972 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I
was born in the US.

00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Exactly.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: And now that
this is all established,

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.652 align:middle line:84%
I can't decide, well,
I wish I would've

00:38:33.652 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:84%
had a different family,
I wish I would've

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.374 align:middle line:84%
been born somewhere
else, I wish I

00:38:36.374 --> 00:38:38.225 align:middle line:84%
would've been born
other than 1972.

00:38:38.225 --> 00:38:40.420 align:middle line:90%
That was-- My soul chose that.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:90%
My soul locked that stuff in.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.079 align:middle line:84%
My soul locked in the time
when I was born, the site.

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
fascinating to me.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.430 align:middle line:84%
This is where I do a lot
of the work with people.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.555 align:middle line:90%
That's the obvious fate.

00:38:49.555 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:90%
That's your obvious fate.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:84%
The less obvious fate
is the psychic fate

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.820 align:middle line:90%
that you were born into.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So we were born in an era
when certain psychic patterns,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs, and ways
of seeing reality

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.270 align:middle line:84%
were part of what
created reality.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Before you and I showed up
on the scene on this planet,

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:84%
there already were patterns
creating reality here

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.870 align:middle line:90%
that we emerged into.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.410 align:middle line:84%
We didn't just
bring them with us.

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:16.035 align:middle line:90%
They were here.

00:39:16.035 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:90%
That's fate.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So destiny is, all right, as you
awaken, as you get your power,

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:84%
your connection to
yourself online,

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:84%
now what are you
going to do in that?

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to in that.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a
unique call with that.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:38.834 align:middle line:84%
And that is, I think,
answered two ways.

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Harvey, one
of my friends--

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:42.922 align:middle line:84%
I think you've interviewed
him before and I love him.

00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:44.130 align:middle line:90%
He was on my radio show once.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.463 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know, if you
want to know your purpose,

00:39:46.463 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:84%
wake up in the morning and
look outside your window.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And ask yourself, what
breaks your heart the most?

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: I love that.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I could barely
breathe after he said that.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.042 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Oh my god, this is big.

00:39:55.042 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: I know.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I could barely breathe.

00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the first way I think
you locate your purpose.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So we all have-- there's
enough heartbreak to go around.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think for all of us, we
have a particular heartbreak.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
For me, one of my heartbreaks
is people being bullied or being

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.010 align:middle line:84%
shamed because I grew
up with it so heavy.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.294 align:middle line:84%
So anyone, I don't care who
you are, I will draw a sword

00:40:15.294 --> 00:40:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and stand in front
of the bully for you,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.925 align:middle line:84%
just like I did when
I was five years old.

00:40:19.925 --> 00:40:21.655 align:middle line:90%
It's gong to make me cry.

00:40:21.655 --> 00:40:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: This is big.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yeah.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.637 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
part of it is--

00:40:24.637 --> 00:40:26.553 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And then I'm
going to cry, so please.

00:40:26.553 --> 00:40:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: I know.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:90%
No, this is nature.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.245 align:middle line:84%
This is human
nature at its best.

00:40:32.245 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: It's the
organic nature of destiny.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Destiny is very
organic, actually.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It comes from-- people, what is
my destiny, what is my purpose.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.640 align:middle line:90%
What have you been through?

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:90%
What have you had to survive?

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
It's like my mother,
who's a recovering addict.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of her destiny was to
become a counselor for addicts.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
She runs a treatment facility
on Pine Ridge Reservation

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
for the Lakota Indians.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was her
calling in part.

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:90%
So it comes from that.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But also as you sit with
your heartbreak, what

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:84%
talents and gifts in you
can help the healing?

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
And then also throw in passion.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And then now you have destiny.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:90%
This is your destiny code.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It's my heartbreak, my
talents and gifts and skills.

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And then how I have overcome
or moved through obstacles.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And then where's my
passion in all of that?

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.690 align:middle line:84%
What makes you want to
get out of bed and care

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:90%
about this world?

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And care about
people in this world?

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.253 align:middle line:90%
That is destiny.

00:41:30.253 --> 00:41:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It's destiny.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.121 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I think we're
going to leave it on that.

00:41:33.121 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:90%
I really feel it.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know that all the
beautiful Gaiam audience

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.630 align:middle line:90%
can feel it, too.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:90%
We're all in there together.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And you said it beautifully.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.627 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

00:41:46.627 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm thrilled to have done
this interview with you.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was going to be
just an amazing time with you,

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.572 align:middle line:90%
I could tell.

00:41:53.572 --> 00:41:54.780 align:middle line:90%
My intuition could tell that.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:90%
My heart could tell that.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited if you
have some comments

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and you want to drop some
little comments there and get

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.330 align:middle line:84%
this conversation
going about destiny.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.860 align:middle line:90%
What is your destiny, you know?

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:90%
What did you have to go through?

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.360 align:middle line:84%
We didn't quite tap into the
whole authenticity, which

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.056 align:middle line:84%
is a huge last little
point before we

00:42:14.056 --> 00:42:15.430 align:middle line:84%
finish because we
want some more.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Just a last little bit
about authenticity.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And once we start
doing this shadow work,

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.577 align:middle line:84%
why is that so important,
especially now in these times?

00:42:23.577 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: I think authenticity
is your GPS of intuition.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:10%
I think that it
is the part of you

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.154 align:middle line:10%
that you know is your truth.

00:42:30.154 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people think
that what happened

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.778 align:middle line:10%
to them is their truth.

00:42:32.778 --> 00:42:35.520 align:middle line:10%
Like I could be, if someone's
on here, and say, you know,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.692 align:middle line:10%
I'm a survivor of abuse.

00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:90%
That's my authenticity.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.010 align:middle line:90%
No, that's what happened to you.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Your victimization
isn't your authenticity.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It's who you are underneath
in your essence that's

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:90%
your authenticity.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And authenticity is
always about connection.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It's about here I am.

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:50.977 align:middle line:90%
I'm locating me.

00:42:50.977 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:90%
There you are.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's connect.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And connect in a way
that's genuine, vulnerable,

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:84%
but also open and
willing to love.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about connections to
love, and yourself, and esteem,

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and core worth,
and Buddha nature.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Soul esteem.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.946 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Soul esteem.

00:43:04.946 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Soul esteem.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.697 align:middle line:90%
Very different than self-esteem.

00:43:07.697 --> 00:43:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Yes.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Something I came up with
when I was writing the book.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Soul esteem is--
and it's something

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that you-- Ego esteem's when
we start to develop things

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.670 align:middle line:90%
by accomplishments.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:16.335 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with it.

00:43:16.335 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
It's psychologically
on a human level

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.394 align:middle line:84%
how we should develop
esteem initially.

00:43:19.394 --> 00:43:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But as you spiritually
mature into

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:84%
spiritual-awakened adulthood--
for example, Martin Luther

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.350 align:middle line:84%
King, Junior had to
have some soul esteem

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
because he was taking on a
cultural pattern of racism.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And if he wouldn't have had some
kind of innate sense of worth

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.869 align:middle line:84%
to stand up to that, he
couldn't have pulled it off.

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:39.660 align:middle line:90%
That's soul esteem.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.326 align:middle line:84%
It's the party that
says, you know what?

00:43:41.326 --> 00:43:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not moving in
the world based

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:90%
on what people think of me.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm moving in the
world based on who

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.484 align:middle line:84%
I am and my need to
wake people up to love.

00:43:50.484 --> 00:43:51.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm moving into.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And if that means I have
to tell you racism's wrong,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and that might take me out,
I might get shot, I'm in.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It trumps survival
drive and fear.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is so powerful in you,

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:84%
some metaphysical impulse
that you can't make happen.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:90%
You can touch in.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And it will always
guide you to-- I

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:13.769 align:middle line:84%
call it your perfumed
version of destiny.

00:44:13.769 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Robert, we
want more of you.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:16.110 align:middle line:90%
We love you.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking for everybody.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:90%
My god, this is good.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.630 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you, thank
you for being who you are--

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>OHOTTO: Thank
you for having me.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It's been great.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: --and daring to be
that beautiful man that you are.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:24.566 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Thank you.

00:44:24.566 --> 00:44:24.784 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:24.784 --> 00:44:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We send you lots of
love, my beautiful co-creators.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.215 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have
enjoyed this interview.

00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:90%
There's many, many interviews.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Many of my shows have
been actually taped

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Go and check it out.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.650 align:middle line:90%
We send you much love.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Robert.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.233 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Thank you.

00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: The title of your book,
"Forming Fate--" transforming,

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.640 align:middle line:90%
not forming. "Transforming--

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Transforming.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.931 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: "--Fate Into Destiny."

00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Much love to you, and have a
beautiful, amazing, inspiring

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Robert.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OHOTTO: Thank you.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:45:01.667 align:middle line:90%
