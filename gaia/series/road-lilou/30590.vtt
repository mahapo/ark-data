00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.370 align:middle line:10%
Hello, this is
Lilou for Gaiam TV.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm in Manchester
in cold England with Steve.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:10%
Hello.
-Hi.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm cold, too.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's all in
the mind, isn't it?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I use my vital energies
to warm me up a bit.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're an author
and a lecturer.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
You wrote many books.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Seven, including
my book of poetry.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Six nonfiction prose books
and one book of poetry.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And the latest one is
"Back to Sanity," right?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And before that was,
"Out of the Darkness?"

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And before that I had a book
called, "Waking from Sleep."

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And before that there's a
book called, "The Fall,"

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and a couple of other books.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So you do lectures at
the University of Leeds.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And do you practice?

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:84%
What is your day to day life
like so that we can understand

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.290 align:middle line:84%
how you came to this
place of teaching people

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
to live more fully and
more in the present moment?

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I lecture at Leeds
Metropolitan University.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm I lecturer in
transversal psychology.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And ever since I
was a teenager--

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
maybe 15 or
16-years-old-- I've always

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
felt connected to something
spiritual inside myself.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a teenager,
I was the complete opposite

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:90%
of a normal teenager.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go out to nightclubs.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I went to open spaces
and fields and parks

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:90%
to walk around on my own.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very
attracted to nature,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
to stillness, and to quietness.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And, as a result, people
thought I was a bit strange.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was a bit strange.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a
long time to accept

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
my basic spiritual nature
and to understand it

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because my background
was completely

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
non-spiritual,
non-religious, typical kind

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
of northern working
class English background.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a long time to
understand myself completely.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But once I did, once I realized
that there was such a thing

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
as meditation, and
there was such things

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual traditions
and spiritual books,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
they gave me a framework
to understand myself.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And after that I integrated
spirituality into my life.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:90%
And life is quite hectic now.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:90%
I've three young children.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:90%
And so life is quite busy.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.080 align:middle line:90%
And I'm working as a lecturer.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to write
whenever I can.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The difficult thing is finding
time to do some writing.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
It's quite impressive to have
even Eckhart Tolle say that you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:90%
bring an important piece here.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And Eckhart Tolle
obviously is right now

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I think the number one
I mean in that hundred

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
top spiritual
people in the world.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You're part of that list, too.
-Yeah.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I think Eckhart has gone
down to number two now.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:90%
The Dali Lama is number one.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:90%
But I'm working my way up.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.131 align:middle line:84%
Next year I expect
to be in the top 10.

00:02:58.131 --> 00:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
No.
Only joking.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.954 align:middle line:84%
I started writing
maybe 15 years ago.

00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
My first couple of books
weren't particularly good

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.165 align:middle line:90%
and they weren't published.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But about 10 years
ago my writing

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
started to be published in
magazines and in journals.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
I write in some
academic journals, too.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
My last three or four books
have been fairly successful

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
and they've built
up some momentum.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've become
slightly more prominent

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and that's really good.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You speak about the
ego madness and there's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
something in this world that
is not quite going right.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us more about it?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Because our ego does want
to get to the top 10--

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:90%
if not number one.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what you've learned
there through your research.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Well I call it humania.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Humania is my term for the
madness of the human mind.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think first of all if
you look back at human history,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:84%
if you go back a few
thousand years, if you look

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
into previous
civilizations, human history

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
is an endless story
of insanities,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.325 align:middle line:84%
an endless story of brutality,
conflict, and oppression.

00:04:01.325 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
The oppressions of
different classes.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:90%
The oppression of women.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The oppression of everybody
apart from a small group

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of elite or privileged people.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's endless
warfare, endless conflict,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
sexual repression, the
repression of completely

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
natural human impulses,
and also there's

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:90%
hostility towards nature.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
That's still obviously
very prevalent

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
nowadays with our
environmental problems.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We're close to
seriously severely

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:90%
damaging our environment.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious that
there's something

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.860 align:middle line:84%
not quite right about human
beings collectively and also

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
individually.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I know when I was a teenager
I'd walk down streets,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and in every house
I'd see people

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
watching TV in living
room after living

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:90%
room walking down the streets.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody would be sitting
there staring at a picture

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:90%
box in the corner of the room.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Family or a person on their own.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:90%
And it made me think.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Why do people need to do this?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do people need to
watch TV 30 hours a week?

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
What are they trying
to escape from?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember
when I left university

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:90%
I did a few dreary office jobs.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the first ones
I met a guy who had actually

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
retired from his previous
job but he'd come back

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
to work because he was bored.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, I don't
like doing nothing

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.317 align:middle line:90%
so I've come back to work.

00:05:19.317 --> 00:05:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was amazing
that somebody who was retired

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:84%
would actually choose
to come back to work.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's partly this
disease of doing.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the desire to
constantly be active.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's always seemed to
me that human beings--

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
or actually human doings-- human
beings is actually a misnomer.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It's very different
for us to be.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to analyze
why do human beings

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
find it so difficult to be.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do we need to do
things all the time?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to put our
attention in television

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:90%
programs or in the internet.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Why are we trying to
escape from ourselves?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we're trying to escape
from is a discord in our minds.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I call it psychological discord.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Partly it's the sense of
ego separation, a sense

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
of being apart from
our environment

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and being alone in
our mental space.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.924 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the crazy
restlessness of our minds.

00:06:11.924 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
When people are on the
road with nothing to do,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
they're faced with the crazy
restlessness, the chattering

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.160 align:middle line:84%
thoughts which produce
anxieties about the future,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
which produce feelings
of bitterness or guilt

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.230 align:middle line:90%
about the past.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.465 align:middle line:84%
So this chattering
mind-- on the one hand

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
it causes a disturbance inside
of us, and on the other hand

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
it creates anxiety, it
creates negative feelings

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
about the future and the past
or about life in general.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.787 align:middle line:84%
So I think collectively
and also individually it's

00:06:39.787 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
obvious that there's
something not

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
quite right about human beings.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying also then
that if we feel this way

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
it's due to a
collective thoughts?

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
It might not be our
own thoughts that might

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:90%
be why we're so disturbed?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we inherit
but also kind of

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
absorb and sponge some other
people's emotions and egos?

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you see all of this?

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.740 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I think that's true.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the idea that an
individual is really a fallacy.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as an individual.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Even though we often have
the sense that we're alone

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.910 align:middle line:84%
in our mental space with our own
thoughts and our own feelings.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:90%
That's an illusion.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
In reality we're constantly
absorbing impressions and even

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:90%
thoughts from other people.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So you can sense it.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.643 align:middle line:84%
If you go into a room and
somebody is in a bad mood,

00:07:29.643 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
you pick up on that
mood straight away.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's actually called mood
contagion in psychology.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
If someone is in a
good mood, you maybe

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
don't even know it
consciously, but their mood

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
somehow spreads to you.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like a radiance around
them that spreads to you.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing, we do
subconsciously absorb thoughts

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.490 align:middle line:90%
from other people, too.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's a vicious circle.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
If the people around us
are thinking negatively,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
if they're full of disturbance,
then that will spread to us.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Although it could
in a positive way

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
work positively if
we think positively

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.182 align:middle line:84%
and appreciatively
thoughts of gratitude,

00:08:04.182 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:90%
and that would spread, as well.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And how is that linked?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So psychology, how does
that understanding better

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
human beings and this part
that you just explained on ego,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
how does that help us in
our own spiritual evolution?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important to understand

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
the workings of the
ego, because then

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
you can begin to transcend it.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand
the problem in order

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:90%
to transcend that problem.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think the first step
for me is to understand

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:90%
the workings of the ego.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
That's what I try to do in "Back
to Sanity," in the first part

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:90%
of the book, anyway.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of tried to do
that earlier in my book

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
before where I try to
explain the development

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.997 align:middle line:90%
of the ego in historical terms.

00:08:43.997 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's really
important in that first stage

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of understanding and then you
can begin to unpick the ego

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.384 align:middle line:84%
and work out how
to transcend it.

00:08:52.384 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you explain?

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
You tell us how to be
in the present moment

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:90%
and to let go of that ego?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it really possible?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I think so.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Is that what some people
call enlightenment?

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Spiritual awakening.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's both.
Yeah.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You can call it enlightenment
or spiritual awakening.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think there are varying
degrees along that path.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:90%
There's not a sudden break.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
For some people there
may be a sudden break

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:90%
into enlightenment.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But often it's a
very gradual process.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think the important
thing about humania,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:84%
as I call it-- the madness
of the human mind--

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:90%
it can be healed.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Like any psychological
disorder, it can be treated

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:90%
and it can be healed.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to see
the world as mad first?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.017 align:middle line:84%
-It's not our fault.
-Well, yeah.

00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to look
at the human mind

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and realize what's wrong
with the human mind.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
What are the factors which
cause our sufferings.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like
Buddhism, really.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is all about trying
to transcend suffering.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
transcend suffering,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
the Buddha tries to
understand the human mind.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And then he suggests the
way to transcend suffering.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So in "Back to Sanity"
I suggest an eight

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
stage path through which
we can transcend humania.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I have
many questions now

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:10%
about the different stages of
evolution, as you describe it,

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:10%
but also how to transcend.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, for some
people, transcendence

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:90%
can happen very suddenly.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I talked about that in my
book, "Out of the Darkness."

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Especially when people go
through intense turmoil

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and suffering, it
can suddenly jolt

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:84%
them into a state of awakening,
which can become permanent.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
But for other people it's
a more gradual process

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
through personal development
or spiritual development.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are a number
of stages along that path.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
first stages is learning

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to live with ourselves.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
We're so addicted
to external stimuli.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
We're so addicted to
fixing our attention

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
to external things like TV,
computers, books, magazines.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The first stage
for many people is

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to learn to live with
themselves and to learn

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
to live in the present moment
without fixing their attention

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
to something external.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And for some people
that's quite a big step.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:84%
To go inside your
own mind and feel

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.531 align:middle line:84%
comfortable inside your own
mind is quite a big step.

00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.896 align:middle line:84%
It really feels there's
something else just before

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
that to be able to even
be there and realize

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that you can just be.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the important
stages, the initial stages,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is to stand back from your
own mind or your own thoughts

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and learn to observe
them, because most people

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
for most of the time
are completely caught

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:90%
up in their own thoughts.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like a river.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine a
river flowing by,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
most people are
flowing with the river.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But we need to imagine
that we're standing

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
back, sitting on the
bank of the river

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
watching the river flow by.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And once you learn the
ability to stand back

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
from your thoughts,
then you're no longer

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
affected by them as much.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer affected
by negative thoughts.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You can think a negative
thought and you're

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
aware it's just a negative
thought and let it go by.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't trigger
a negative emotion.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And you could call that
disidentifying with thoughts.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And also once you
disidentify with thoughts,

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.810 align:middle line:84%
once you stand back and observe
them, they lose their power.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are fueled
by attention.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Attention is like
the gasoline which

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
fuels the motor of thinking.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you withdraw your
attention and stand back,

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:84%
thoughts naturally
fade away like a car

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.472 align:middle line:90%
when it runs out of gas.

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:31.295 align:middle line:90%
So that's really important.

00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes,
[SPUTTERING ENGINE SOUND].

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So at some point we will want
more of that peaceful state?

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:90%
We'll seek more of that?

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It feels, I think
to a lot of us,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
like there's these washing
machines before we get

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
to this place where
we flip it and it's

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
more of the peacefulness than
the ego mind running the show.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I think most fundamental
nature is harmony.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I contrast humania with harmony.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We all have moments
of harmony of being,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:90%
as I call it, from time to time.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Harmony of being in nature,
for example, as we are today.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:84%
People often experience that
sense of ease and calmness

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
when they're in
natural surroundings.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
They feel a sense of
connection to nature.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Other people experience it when
they go running or swimming.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
It happens a lot
after sex, as well.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
A sense of connection, that
sense of inner well being,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
sense of transcendence.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And many other situations, too.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
people who go and practice

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
extreme sports like maybe hang
gliding, paragliding, climbing,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think these sports can
generate harmony of being too

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.790 align:middle line:84%
because they involve
so much concentration

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
that the mind becomes so focused
that it becomes very quiet.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts begin to fade away.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Interesting that you bring
that up because immediately

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
we think of adrenaline
and this rush

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of natural drug
and you wanting more of it.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same for
spiritual awakening

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and when you arrive to
this place of harmony?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who do these
sports are sometimes called

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
thrill seekers or
adrenaline seekers,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.010 align:middle line:84%
but I think they're also
seeking a harmony of being.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
They're seeking the
spaciousness and fullness which

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:90%
comes when your mind is empty.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think for some surfing
is well known for producing

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
spiritual feelings.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people suggest that surfing
could be a kind of religion

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
because surfers are very
aware of these transcendental

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:90%
feelings that they have.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
thing again, it's

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:90%
partly content with nature.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It's partly quieting the mind
so much that your ego boundaries

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
begin to fade away and
you feel the spaciousness

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:90%
and fullness of true being.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.735 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the ego really
screams out and is really

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
there is those fears, because
there is fears attached

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:90%
to the ego, isn't there?

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with that
when it's really strong

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and you nearly feel you
can't breathe anymore?

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I think partly fears are
generated by thoughts.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The thought always
precedes the fear.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you analyze
your thinking, you'll

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
probably come upon
some negative scripts,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.090 align:middle line:84%
some sort of habitual
cognitive patterns

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.685 align:middle line:90%
which create these fears.

00:15:25.685 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like flying, for example.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
I used to be afraid of flying.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Commercial airplanes?

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Any airplanes.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.039 align:middle line:84%
-Not just piloting?
-No.

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Any airplanes.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
it's basically thoughts.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of creating
scenarios in my mind

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:90%
about things going wrong.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It was basically sort
of images and scenarios

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
forming in my mind.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.565 align:middle line:84%
And once I learned to quiet
my mind in that situation

00:15:50.565 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
when I was flying, and also
once I learned to override

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.940 align:middle line:84%
those negative thought
patterns with more rational,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
positive thought patterns,
then I began to lose the fear.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But also I think
there can be more

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.175 align:middle line:84%
deep rooted fears which stem
from childhood experiences.

00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It could be trauma.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And those kind of fears
and that kind of pain

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:84%
can be very difficult
to transcend.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I think for that
kind of pain you

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.935 align:middle line:84%
really need to see a
psychotherapist to try

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:22.665 align:middle line:90%
to override or transcend.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The pain is really
deep inside the psyche.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:10%
How do we know if we
really need external help?

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
it appears so real

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the fear of let's say when you
lose your job or everything

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:90%
collapses in your life.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Your identity, what you
identified before is no longer,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and this seems all so
brutal, so difficult,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
like an old world is
literally collapsing.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it feels like to
me that's what a lot of people

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:84%
are going through these
days through 2012.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:84%
With those issues I think
it's very important to be aware

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
that there's always a positive
side to any kind of loss

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of collapse,
even though it can seem very

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
devastating and it can
create lots of turmoil

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
and can lead to trauma.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
But in every loss there's
always a new beginning.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
There's always an opening
to spiritual energies

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual potentials.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
In my book, "Out
of the Darkness,"

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I did lots of research about the
effects of trauma and turmoil.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I found that that was
by far the most powerful

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
trigger of spiritual awakening.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Even most of the
spiritual teachers

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
who are well known
today, many of them,

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
went through this very
pronounced period of turmoil,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:84%
like Eckhart Tolle,
Byron Katie, for example.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And many, many people go
through that before they

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
become awakened.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And partly what happens
is that all of these

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
attachments that we identify
with-- our sense of who we are,

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
a sense that we're
important, a sense

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that you've built up some
power or status, that you have

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.655 align:middle line:84%
a certain future
in front of you,

00:18:03.655 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have a certain
path behind, that you have

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.360 align:middle line:84%
a certain role in
society with possessions

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- all
of these things

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:84%
are attachments that build
up your sense of self.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes call them the
building blocks of the ego.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
The scaffolding that
supports the ego.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But when terrible
experiences occur,

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
these attachments
are broken away.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:90%
You lose your job.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:90%
You lose your future.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.585 align:middle line:90%
You lose your friends.

00:18:26.585 --> 00:18:30.771 align:middle line:84%
You learn your partner through
divorce or perhaps bereavement.

00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
-Lose your health.
-Or your health.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.849 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
You may be faced
with imminent death.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
You may be told that you
only have a certain amount

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.705 align:middle line:90%
of time left to live.

00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And obviously you
feel devastated.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Your whole world collapses.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But when that happens for
some people-- not everybody,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.380 align:middle line:84%
but for some
people-- there can be

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
this sudden, miraculous
opening to spiritual awakening.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:90%
The old self collapses.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as if there
is a latent higher self which

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
suddenly bursts forth and
emerges like a butterfly

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:90%
emerging from a chrysalis.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And that latent higher self
becomes your normal self.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
The old self dies.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And like a phoenix arising,
a new self-- a higher self--

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:84%
takes over and become
your normal self.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:10%
Does that happen in the moment
of connecting to a higher power

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:10%
or source or the universe?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Does it go through that?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Did you find out that it
has to go through that,

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:10%
or just it can be in a moment?

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that
triggers this kind of opening?

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
The trigger for most of the
people that I've spoken to--

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and this is my own
experience, too-- the trigger

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is acceptance and
surrender or letting go.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
For some people it
was their suffering

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
was so intense that they
couldn't fight it anymore.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Like I spoke to one
woman who lost her job,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.315 align:middle line:84%
she was divorced
from her partner.

00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
She felt like a
complete failure.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
She was very depressed.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
She didn't feel like she
could leave her house.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.080 align:middle line:90%
She stayed inside for two weeks.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to die basically
but she didn't have

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
the courage to commit suicide.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
One day she just
said, that's enough,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't fight this anymore.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.981 align:middle line:84%
I'm just giving up.
I don't care.

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm just giving up.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment when
something moved inside her.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And another example was a friend
of mine who was an alcoholic

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and he went to
Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And he went through
the process of handing

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
over his problem, which is
part of the process in AA.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said to himself, this
is too big for me to deal with.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:90%
I've tried to fight it.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I can't fight it.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hand it
over to a higher power,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.574 align:middle line:90%
whatever the higher power is.

00:20:43.574 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it was
just in that moment

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
of handing over that he felt
something change inside him.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if a dam
suddenly burst open inside him

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and this new energy, this
blissful energy suddenly arose

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:90%
and filled his whole being.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly felt
like a different person.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And that continued.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So surrender or letting
go, you could call it

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the alchemical agent which
enables this transformation

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember this moment
in my personal journey,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%
this moment of suffering.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And, all of a sudden, I
had open arms and looked up

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and there was really
literally in that instant the

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:90%
taking a lot of air.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the
light and the air

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:84%
coming in every single
part of inside of the body,

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:90%
like really just re-energizing.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It felt so good, like
I'm breathing again.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.255 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:42.255 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:84%
I think many people
when they go through

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.394 align:middle line:90%
something they contract.

00:21:46.394 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:90%
They make themselves smaller.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:90%
But if you open yourself up--

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was the
ultimate moment

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.371 align:middle line:84%
because before that
there was some suffering.

00:21:53.371 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-It was a good part.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
That was a positive part.
Yeah.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you open
yourself up, then

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.320 align:middle line:84%
you allow the
potentially positive side

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:90%
to manifest itself.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And later on, once
we are in that phase,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
once that first phase
of spiritual awakening

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:90%
has happened, what's next?

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, for some people,
spiritual transformation

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is not a straightforward
transition

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:90%
into bliss and peacefulness.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
For some people there's
a period of confusion

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
afterwards even though they
feel a sense of calmness

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of
bliss even inside,

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
they feel connected to
something transcendent.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They still sometimes
feel confused

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
because maybe they don't have
a background in spirituality.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the people around
them don't understand them.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.460 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
themselves.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:90%
So there can be some confusion.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes even they
begin to doubt themselves.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
They begin to wonder, am I mad?

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:90%
What's happening to me?

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Why am I so different?

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
that these people

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:90%
have a supportive framework.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
that they establish

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:84%
an intellectual framework
which enables them

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:90%
to understand what's happened.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And often that happens
naturally anyway.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
They gravitate to
spiritual books.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
They naturally gravitate
to spiritual groups.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.130 align:middle line:90%
They begin to meditate.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So slowly they begin to piece
together what's happening.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But also there can be
some slight disturbances

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:90%
in the mind, as well.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:10%
There can be some
strange sensations,

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:10%
some psychic episodes which
they may not understand,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:10%
which may make them
feel some anxiety.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:10%
And it may also be difficult for
them to cope in everyday life

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:10%
because they sometimes
begin to enjoy being so much

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:10%
that they find it
difficult to do.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:10%
It's the exact opposite
of the normal situation.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.260 align:middle line:10%
So they need to find a
balance where they're not so

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:10%
blissed out and so
immersed in their own bliss

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:10%
that they forget to live
in the real world-- well,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.680 align:middle line:10%
the seemingly real world.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They forget to live
in the everyday world.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And that normally
happens after a while.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes there
is a difficult period

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:10%
of integration.
-And then?

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Your ultimate state?

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Well I think in the end most
people do become balanced.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The ideal state is to
find a state of balance.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
To integrate the awakened state
into your normal personality

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and to live with
it on a daily basis

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and to function in
the everyday world,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to be able to function
in relationships,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and to be active in the world.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:90%
That's the ideal state.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And in some spiritual
traditions--

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian
tradition it's called

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Sahaja Samadhi, for example.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:90%
This constant state of Samadhi.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Samadhi isn't just a
state where you bliss out

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and forget the material
world and transcend

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:90%
the material world.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It's Sahaja Samadhi where
you live in the real world--

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
in the everyday world--
but you are awakened

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and you bring your awakening
to other people, too.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
ideal things too

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that once you become
established in awakening,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
your awakening begins to radiate
to other people around you

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to move
towards awakening, too.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Your radiance spreads
to them and awakens

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
something inside of
them and it encourages

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:90%
their development, too.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.313 align:middle line:90%
Pretty good news, huh?

00:25:29.313 --> 00:25:31.001 align:middle line:90%
It's good news.

00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of
people that have partners

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:90%
that might not be spiritual.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
saying-- you're at work

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
maybe or in the family--
but you're saying if we are

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
just that, not
having expectations,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:90%
then something happens there.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Possibly?

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Possibly.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've found that it did
cause problems that when people

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
had this awakening
it sometimes caused

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:90%
problems in relationships.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.114 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes lead to divorce.

00:25:57.114 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:10%
People saying, you don't
understand me anymore.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:90%
You've gone crazy.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand you.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So obviously it
can cause problems.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We were talking earlier
about mood contagion.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a similar thing.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You're awakening.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Awakening seems to be more
contagious than anything.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:90%
More contagious than any mood.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it can spread to
the people around you.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the potentially
positive side.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:10%
Did you see on a scientific
level what happens really?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.476 align:middle line:90%
You mean in the brain?

00:26:27.476 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm wondering what we emanate.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Or is there something
that makes it so?

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I think in really
moving beyond science

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:90%
or beyond mainstream science.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science would try
to explain it in terms of brain

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.850 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, certain bits
of the brain are active,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:48.374 align:middle line:84%
and certain brain chemicals
are firing or connecting.

00:26:48.374 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think you really
need to move beyond that.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You talk about energies
which mainstream

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:90%
science really doesn't accept.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
The idea of an
inner vital energy

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.611 align:middle line:84%
is not accepted by
most scientists.

00:27:00.611 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's
what's happening.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.943 align:middle line:84%
When somebody
becomes enlightened,

00:27:02.943 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
their life energy becomes
so powerful and so pure

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:90%
that it naturally radiates.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:90%
They become like suns.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They become like suns
radiating their enlightenment

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:90%
toward other people.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Like dolphins.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Like dolphins, too.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it gives a lie to
the illusion of individuality.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The illusion that we're encased
in this body and I'm in here,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
you're in there,
and we can't really

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
communicate except through
words or hand signals.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Really that's a big fallacy.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We're communicating
through energies.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:90%
We're exchanging energies.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
kinds of unconscious

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
or seemingly transcientific
phenomenon happening.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:90%
How do you see oneness?

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Is that the oneness
that a lot of people

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
talk about that we might
reach on the planet?

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Partly.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.230 align:middle line:84%
At the moment I'm struggling
with the coldness.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.104 align:middle line:90%
Forget the oneness.

00:27:58.104 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm struggling with the
coldness in Manchester.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, oneness is the
true nature of all beings.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Separateness is the illusion
and oneness is our true nature.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And partly it is the
activity of our minds

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
which creates the
illusion of separateness.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
When you think, you reinforce
the sense of I. There's

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.480 align:middle line:90%
always an I which is thinking.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Could be an eye observing.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, la la.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.910 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, there's both.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a thinking
eye and observing eye.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But the observing eye
isn't a separate eye.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:84%
The observing eye is part
of this interconnected

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
network of consciousness.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you stop thinking,
when your mind becomes quiet,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.910 align:middle line:84%
then you sink into
this ocean of oneness.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And when your mind
is really clear,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
you feel this sense
of spaciousness

00:28:55.340 --> 00:29:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and you do feel in some way,
you spread beyond your own body.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You transcend separateness
into the space around you

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to connect
with other people.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And at a really deep
level you become so deeply

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:84%
immersed in pure consciousness
that any sense of separation

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.440 align:middle line:90%
fades away.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You realize that the fundamental
reality of the universe

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:84%
is this ocean of
pure consciousness.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most fundamental
level of your being, too.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In your true nature,
in your deepest nature,

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:90%
you're a part of this ocean.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And all reality, all nature, all
other living beings, all space

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is also part of
this ocean of being.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of us it's
still very conceptual.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.420 align:middle line:90%
But we feel it more in nature.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There's different phases
too within that, I guess.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:10%
I think even at the
conceptual levels,

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:10%
or to a more superficial
level, you can still sense it.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.040 align:middle line:90%
You can sense it in nature.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
nature is so appealing.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:10%
That's why so many people love
to walk in the countryside,

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:10%
because in the
countryside I think

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:10%
nature radiates stillness.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And in nature our minds
naturally become quieter.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We begin to tune in to this
connection, this connectedness.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:10%
And we begin to
sense that oneness.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Are you cold?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit cold.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to get your jumper?

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:90%
for now.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So the practices--
walking in nature

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.935 align:middle line:90%
could be one of those practices?

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I think in
spiritual development

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:84%
there is sometimes this idea
that spiritual practice means

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
doing meditation, doing yoga,
maybe doing a bit of bit

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Tai Chi, et cetera.

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.097 align:middle line:84%
You look like somebody
that does Tai Chi.

00:30:45.097 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I have done it in the past.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I did Qigong, which
is really similar.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:90%
And I do yoga every so often.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And I meditate regularly.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.834 align:middle line:84%
But I think the term
"spiritual practice"

00:30:56.834 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:90%
should be much broader.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It should encompass many other
activities besides purely

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:90%
spiritual practice.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you approach it
in the right frame of mind,

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:84%
walking in the countryside
is a spiritual practice.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Swimming can be a
spiritual practice.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Sex can be a spiritual practice.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And obviously in
the tantric schools

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:90%
that idea is quite prominent.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And running can be a
spiritual practice.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.520 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of sports.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Surfing, for example,
climbing-- they

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.290 align:middle line:84%
can all be spiritual
practices because they

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%
all lead to connectedness.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:84%
They all have a mind
quieting effect.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And they all lead to a
sense of transcendence.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
spiritual practices.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:10%
When we're in purpose, it's a
spiritual practice, isn't it?

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of meditation.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We're more in the
present moment.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.940 align:middle line:90%
We're enjoying it.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The heart opens.
-Yeah.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, anything,
even making the dinner,

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:84%
even washing the dishes, they
can be spiritual practices.

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.916 align:middle line:90%
Not washing the dishes.

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I would be a good practice.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, have you
got a dishwasher?

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, even loading
dishes in the dishwasher

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.034 align:middle line:90%
could be a spiritual practice.

00:32:10.034 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:84%
If you approach it in
the right frame of mind--

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:84%
if you approach it
mindfully-- if you attempt

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to be consciously aware
of what you're doing,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.320 align:middle line:84%
then it can become a
spiritual practice.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
in purpose-- I'm

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
going back to this
because it seems like when

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:84%
our soul does the work
it's supposed to do

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:90%
it feels like it's a blessing.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:90%
There's gratitude.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.780 align:middle line:90%
There's heart connection.

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There's being in
the present moment.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:90%
The mind is less running.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.340 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm interested also
to do some interviews about how

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:10%
to live one's life purpose,
because I think there

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:10%
is a lot there in our
spiritual awakening and growth

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:10%
within that.
-That's right.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
you can consciously do.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go and allow
the purpose to take you along.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to
flow with your purpose.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you approach it too
intellectually with your ego,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:06.990 align:middle line:90%
you'll fall away from that.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's important to relax.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Tell us, to end this
conversation, the conversation

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:90%
you had with Eckhart Tolle.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
What are the latest
spiritual conversations

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%
of the top people in the world?

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was
interested in my poetry.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.825 align:middle line:84%
He read out a
couple of my poems.

00:33:27.825 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.270 align:middle line:84%
-Your latest poem here.
-Yeah.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.444 align:middle line:84%
I just published my first book
of poems called, "The Meaning."

00:33:36.444 --> 00:33:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And Eckhart, he really liked
them and read a couple of them

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was interested in
where poetry comes from.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:48.605 align:middle line:84%
So we were talking about
the creative intelligence.

00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
A bit like you were
saying before when

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:90%
you find yourself on purpose.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
When you open your heart
and flow with your purpose.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Poetry is a bit like
that, or all creativity

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:90%
is a bit like that.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to let your
rational mind fade away

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and just let the
poetry come to you.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.210 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
open to the source,

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.060 align:middle line:90%
and the source will come to you.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I think that place--
all the great artists

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
were spiritual to some
degree because they

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.010 align:middle line:84%
didn't create with their
minds, the creation

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.219 align:middle line:90%
flowed through them.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Kind of being channeled.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mozart, for example,
said he didn't write the music,

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.000 align:middle line:84%
he heard the music in his
head and he wrote it down.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Many painters were the same.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:90%
So we were talking about that.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about how
the ego takes over our minds

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and leads to chaos and
crisis in the world.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Those kind of things.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have lots and
lots to talk about with him.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
He's really relaxed and has
this really monotoned voice.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.381 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a good
spiritual voice, isn't it?

00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to him
you sort of naturally

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
fall into the mode of stillness.
And you can feel it.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.395 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it
radiating from him.

00:35:02.395 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:90%
This stillness.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you naturally
become quite calm.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:10%
So he has evolved
in his own process

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:10%
from where we knew him from "The
Power of the Present Moment,"

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.430 align:middle line:10%
I think it was, or "The Power
of Now," and to "The New Earth"

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:10%
and where he is now?
-Yeah.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Did he evolve as
a spiritual being,

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:24.440 align:middle line:84%
because the ego could
definitely jump in that one.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it's been for him.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.307 align:middle line:84%
But with Oprah and the TV
and him being number one.

00:35:30.307 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, well, last
year he was number one

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and this year he's number two.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So, I said, how do
you feel about that?

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.580 align:middle line:90%
About slipping down?

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, it was
a big disappointment.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:39.950 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he minds.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I think he's very
happy walking his dog.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:90%
He's got a dog who he loves.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.650 align:middle line:84%
He's very happy
living a simple life.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And he's very funny.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I think in his teachings now
he's developed his humor.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.530 align:middle line:90%
He's really, really funny now.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to
the comedy store.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like a spiritual
comedy store.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.515 align:middle line:84%
It goes hand in hand
because then things

00:36:02.515 --> 00:36:04.940 align:middle line:84%
are not as significant
or a serious anymore

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.841 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes really
simple, doesn't it?

00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of my
guidelines, if you like,

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:84%
as to whether somebody is
really spiritually awakened

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
is to whether they are
humorous and funny,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:90%
whether they smile a lot.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're serious,
then it's probably

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:84%
a sign that you're not really
as awakened as you'd hoped.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Because once you awaken,
there's a sense of ease.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:84%
You do begin to look at the
world in a humorous way.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Things fall lightly on you.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't take things
seriously anymore.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Even if you look into the
chaos and madness of the world,

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:84%
you still don't let it
bare on you heavily.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:42.480 align:middle line:84%
You have this relaxed sense
of ease and calm, which

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:90%
manifests itself in humor.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And this understanding
that everything

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
falls in place at the
right moment, too.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain knowing and
we're more relaxed, isn't it?

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a trust, isn't it?

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:84%
If you trust in the world, than
you accept what will happen

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.310 align:middle line:84%
and you believe, or you
know, that eventually things

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:90%
will fall into place.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If you don't believe that, if
you believe the whole world is

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.280 align:middle line:84%
random, that the
world is chaotic

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and things just happen
completely randomly,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:90%
then there's a sense of anxiety.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You never know what's
going to happen.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't predict the future.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.280 align:middle line:84%
You're always a bit
wary of the world

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.154 align:middle line:90%
because you don't understand it.

00:37:21.154 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But if you know that things
are going to work out,

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.445 align:middle line:90%
suddenly you can relax.

00:37:24.445 --> 00:37:27.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful
to not know also.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.035 align:middle line:84%
I think we try to
rationalize everything

00:37:32.035 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
everything, but it's

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.160 align:middle line:84%
part of the spiritual quest to
just understand that there's

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
so much bigger than us and we
can't understand everything

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:90%
and it's OK.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.980 align:middle line:90%
It's totally fine.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the issues I
have with mainstream science.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love science.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:90%
I really like astronomy.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
I love finding out
about the human body

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and how the universe works.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I love science.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I've always read science
and scientific books.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.630 align:middle line:84%
But I really
dislike the attitude

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:01.067 align:middle line:84%
of many scientists,
which is that we

00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:01.900 align:middle line:90%
can understand the world.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.210 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
understand the world.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.210 align:middle line:84%
We just need to find
out a few more things,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll have the
whole picture in place.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll have absolute
power because we will have

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:14.070 align:middle line:84%
absolute understanding and we'll
be able to manipulate the world

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:90%
or control it even more.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.035 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a really
dangerous attitude

00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and also a very negative one.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's great to accept
that the world is in some ways

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:90%
beyond our comprehension.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a big fallacy
in that scientists believe

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that the world--
or they perceive

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
with their ordinary
senses-- is the reality.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They believe that
it's absolute reality

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and that the human mind can
understand absolute reality.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the
human mind is limited.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Our awareness is
definitely limited.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We know that because
we have experiences

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:90%
where awareness expands.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.580 align:middle line:84%
But our normal
awareness is limited.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And also every animal
has limited awareness.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:54.570 align:middle line:90%
A sheep has a limited awareness.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:84%
An insect has a
limited awareness.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So human beings obviously
have a limited awareness, too.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.275 align:middle line:84%
So one day there will
be beings in existence

00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
who have a much more
expansive awareness than us

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and who perceive
much wider realities

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and who perceive a
completely different reality.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's obvious that the
world is teeming with things

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.830 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And, as you say, it's
great to accept that.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It's great to open up to the
strangeness and the amazingness

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.441 align:middle line:84%
-[INAUDIBLE] like a child.
-Like a child.

00:39:24.441 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see that
in my young children

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that the world is such
an amazing place to them.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's full of miracles.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as a mundane event

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:90%
or an ordinary event.

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Everything is miraculous.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Especially chocolate cake.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Especially chocolate cake.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so, Steve, for
this conversation for Gaiam TV.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to add this
to this beautiful library

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of conversation in the
world so that it can help

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.070 align:middle line:84%
other people like
us-- all of us--

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:90%
are on this spiritual journey.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no end and it's OK.
-That's great.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
we need to open up to.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.330 align:middle line:84%
The journey is a process
which never ends.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you have one final word
that you want to leave us on,

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
whether we have said
it already but you feel

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.865 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
to keep in mind.

00:40:14.865 --> 00:40:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Maybe humania is on
the surface of the mind.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:10%
All the restlessness
of the mind,

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.210 align:middle line:10%
all of the thought chatter
and all the discord

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.360 align:middle line:10%
is just on the surface.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.890 align:middle line:10%
But underneath the
surface there is

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.110 align:middle line:10%
a deep reservoir of stillness.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:10%
It's a bit like a sea.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:10%
On top of the sea
you have the waves.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:10%
The rush of the waves.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:10%
The turmoil of the
surface of the sea.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:10%
But underneath the surface
there's this endless depth

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.550 align:middle line:10%
of stillness.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's our true nature.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:10%
Our true nature is the
endless depths of stillness.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:10%
And what we need to do
is to tame the surface,

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:10%
to heal the discord
on the surface

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.940 align:middle line:10%
so that we can gain
permanent contact

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.530 align:middle line:10%
with the stillness underneath.
-Thank you.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much for that.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm very visual, so
it really spoke to me.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's great to
make metaphors like that so we

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:15.030 align:middle line:10%
can feel it on a deeper level.
Yeah.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Steve.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Much love.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
My beautiful co-creator
is from Manchester.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be heading
soon to Glasgow

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:84%
for some more
delicious interviews

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
with some beautiful
authors of the Hay

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:90%
House Publishing Company.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Much, much love.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.797 align:middle line:90%
Please share these videos.

00:41:35.797 --> 00:41:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I send you much love
from Manchester.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.567 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
Bye.

00:41:38.567 --> 00:41:39.267 align:middle line:90%
