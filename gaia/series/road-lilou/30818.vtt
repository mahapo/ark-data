00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Hello my delicious co-creators.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm in
beautiful Laguna Beach

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:90%
at the Three Arches Beach.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.425 align:middle line:84%
Is that right, Steven.
-Three Arch Bay, yes.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Three Arch Bay.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
beaches in Laguna.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here with Steven Farmer
that you probably recognize.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Bestselling author.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Could we say even a shaman,
a spiritual teacher?

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:90%
All of these amazing things.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Soul healer.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, wannabe
musician, songwriter.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.526 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Got some dreams?

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually have
recorded some original songs,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and they are-- I do sell
them through my website.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a home
recording, so I'm not

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
sure the-- I think the
quality is pretty decent,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
but the songs are great.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I love the songs.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:10%
I like the songs that have
emerged over the years.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's a bit of a sideline.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not my main gig, but yeah.
Something I enjoy.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.085 align:middle line:90%
It's a passion.

00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, you obviously
have many, many books

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and oracle cards and
videos out there.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Many, many tools
for people to open

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
them up to the spirit world.
Is that right?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
How do you describe
what you want

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to share and transmit to the
viewers and to people, readers?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:10%
Oh, that's a good
question, Lilou.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.021 align:middle line:84%
My desire and my mission is
to revise our relationship

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:90%
with the earth.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.080 align:middle line:10%
I think many of us are in
that process in various means,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:10%
in various ways.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it in a particular
way with my workshops,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
my private sessions,
and certainly the books

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that I put out, as well
as the oracle cards.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we've forgotten that
relationship, particularly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:90%
in our Western culture.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're learning-- it's
interesting that once we called

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
indigenous people
primitives, and yet now we're

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
seeking their help and
seeking their guidance

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and seeking to understand more,
how do they view the world?

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
The earth is alive.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
It's full of life.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It's evidence right before you.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Here the ocean.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully we'll have a
couple of dolphins come by,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:90%
if we're lucky.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And we forget that.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We've been prompted over
the last 10,000 years

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.115 align:middle line:84%
to gradually separate the
spiritual from the material.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
God or gods live up
in the sky somewhere,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and they can only be
reached in some instances

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:90%
through an intermediary.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:90%
Or that we pray up there.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And it began back
10,000 years or so ago,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:90%
what we now call animism.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
The people that walked
on the earth then really

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
knew that, just
knew that as a fact

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that we are related to
everything on this planet.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Trees, plants,
animals, et cetera.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And in that
relationship, there's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
a collaboration that
occurs in the way

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that we can receive
messages from the world.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And part of my mission
is to encourage

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:90%
us to be better listeners.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Listeners with our eyes, our
ears, and certainly our senses.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So what does it take
to open those senses up?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
What does it take to
see the intangible?

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it a question a
feeling it in our hearts?

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Can we-- how can we be in
touch with this whole world?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we haven't really
grown up, most of us, seeing it

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
or knowing it.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more-- I
don't want to say common,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
but I work as-- one
aspect of my work

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that's developed in the
last year and a half

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:90%
is children's products.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've had the opportunity
to meet some of these children

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that are being
raised by parents who

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:90%
are in the awakening process.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:90%
And I say it's a process.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not, you know, something
suddenly, we're awake.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:90%
But it's a process.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And these children have
their eyes and their hearts

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:90%
wide open, and they love nature.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:90%
They love the natural world.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So how do we as adults who
have not grown up in this start

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to expand our repertoire
of relating to the world

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:90%
in this particular way?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the most accessible
is through animals.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
spirit animals.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of what I'm
known for is animal spirit

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
guides teaching
people how to receive

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%
signs from animals who show up.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the most
accessible for most people,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because it's hard
to find anybody that

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:90%
doesn't love animals at all.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people don't
like snakes or this or that.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But most people
love some animals,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
whether domesticated
or wild animals.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
animal itself so much

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:84%
as when the physical animal
appears in an unusual way

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or repeatedly over a
short space of time,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:84%
there's something really
unique going on there

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and in this collaboration.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I love that word too.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The collaboration that's
going on between me,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:90%
the animal, and spirit.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The animal herself or
himself-- I'll say itself,

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
but it's himself or herself--
the animal that shows

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:90%
up-- first there's the animal.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
First there's the
physical animal.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't that a nice-- oh,
look at the crow that

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.641 align:middle line:84%
just landed on the rock here,
or the dolphins just showed up

00:05:28.641 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
there.
That's one thing, OK?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We can enjoy it just
purely for the animal

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:90%
appearing in some way.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Second though, that
there's a life force

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:90%
that's animating that animal.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We could call it that
particular animal's spirit.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Third, though-- and this
is where it gets really

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
fun and interesting--
if, let's say, I'll

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
use the example of the crow
or the dolphin-- and I've got

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
stories galore about these
things actually happening.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
A crow lands three
feet in front of me

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sitting on my
porch or my balcony,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and looks at me like
this with that one eye.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.300 align:middle line:90%
And I qualify that as unusual.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:90%
First there's the crow.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Wow, look.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a cool
little experience.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Second is, ooh, it's alive.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So there's a life
force animating it.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Third, though, it goes
something like this.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:90%
There's grand central.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Grand central.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Earth and the sky
and the cosmos.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
And then there's departments.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the departments
is crow grand central.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So it goes something like this.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The crow-- the big
crow goes, (MUFFLED)

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I see there's Farmer and Lilou
who's sitting on the beach

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:84%
here, and we want to
get a message to them.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So, OK.
Hank.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Hank.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you want to
fly over there?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Just land right
there so we can get

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
a message to them to see
if they could figure out

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.510 align:middle line:90%
what that message is?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.521 align:middle line:84%
And so the crow lands,
and then we go, wow.

00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
OK.
-Like a messenger.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
We're tuned in and we go, whoa,
crow, what's your message?

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's the gist
of how this works.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It also can be symbolic,
a symbol of an animal.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lot of people
have these big dreams.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I call them big dreams,
because they're ones you

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:90%
wake up and you go, oh, my God.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
That was-- and it just
continues to be with you

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of the day.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And the dream about
a particular animal

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
often can be an animal spirit
guide that's trying to get

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
a message to you that way.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, we don't have a lot of
bears here in Laguna Beach.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But if I have a dream about a
bear, it can be significant.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a really cool
experience with a hawk

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:90%
about four weeks ago.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Four-- a little bit more.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:90%
A few weeks back.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Jessica, my wife and
I, were preparing

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
to meet a dear friend and
sister by another mother,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:90%
a sister Eva.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Eva Black Tail Swan.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%
A Cherokee medicine woman.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Lives out in eastern
Colorado, 80 acre ranch.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
I've come to know her
over the last few years

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.040 align:middle line:84%
through a mutual friend,
as well as her writings.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Lilou, she goes out every
morning around 4 o'clock

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and looks
for messages, listens.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
She's a model for what
I'm talking about here.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm not that dedicated to go
out 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I like to sleep in a little
bit more, but God bless her.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
What she does, she'll
go out and she'll

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
be-- she'll listen and
tune in to the world,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:90%
whatever's going on.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
It might be the
buffalo on her ranch.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:90%
Might be grandfather wind.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Might be grandmother moon.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:84%
And she'll tune in, and
it's a message not only

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:90%
for her, but for all people.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
She calls it "Creator
Song," and sends this out

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:90%
to her mailing list every day.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, every day for 30 years.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you a
little background on her

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:90%
to tell you the story.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:84%
She recently was able to publish
a collection of her writings,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.507 align:middle line:90%
"Creator Song."

00:09:03.507 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And they're beautiful.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.073 align:middle line:90%
They're really inspiring.

00:09:05.073 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
And I read them every day.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I get them every day, and
I read them every day.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's a
little background.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
We got to know each other
through a mutual friend.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Did a workshop together
a couple years back.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And Eva asked me to write
a forward for her book.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was happy to do so.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I think her information
needs to be out there.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Creator Song,"
if anyone's interested.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You can find it on
Amazon, et cetera.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
We were preparing,
Jessica and I,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to go to meet her at lunch, OK?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And as you know,
the configuration

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
where my office is at home,
it's in a separate facility.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a separate guest house
that has become my office.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking out of the office
in the backyard, and zoom.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:84%
A hawk, red tail hawk,
flies in, sits on the fence

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
about 25 feet away.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And given that we were
on the way to see Eva,

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.585 align:middle line:84%
not just that but any
time that happens,

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I get very, very excited,
almost to the point

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.030 align:middle line:90%
of jumping up and down.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, it's a real
phenomenal experience to have

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:90%
something like that happen.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So I did what I
suggest to people

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:90%
in my workshops and my books.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
One way to do this--
there's others--

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
but to get the message from
the animal spirit guide--

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
not just the animal or
the spirit of that animal,

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.440 align:middle line:84%
but the animal spirit guide,
the collective consciousness

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of that species, the
oversoul of that species

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is what we're talking
about-- I took a deep breath,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
closed my eyes, and I
said in my mind, hawk

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:90%
brother, what's your message?

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And then I got bullets.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Bing, bing, bing, bing.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.040 align:middle line:90%
I heard them.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that you
can sense these messages.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You can get visions of the
message, or you can hear them.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I tend to hear them.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
First one, it was just exactly
like, one, two, three, four.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you do.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.405 align:middle line:90%
One, restore your faith.

00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant to me was,
I get a little-- I'll show you--

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:90%
honestly, I'll get sloppy.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll get forgetful and
not do my spiritual work,

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:90%
my shamanic journey.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't done it for
about four or five days.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was like, oh.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I've got a journey.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Two, let forgiveness
be a priority.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Good message, good reminder.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Good reminder.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Three-- I'm hearing
this, remember-- let go.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all I heard was let go.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.512 align:middle line:90%
Again, a good reminder.

00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:10%
Not terribly profound, I would
say, but good reminder for me

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:10%
at that time.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one
was very interesting.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:10%
Hawk brother said, when you go
see Eva, pay close attention.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.614 align:middle line:10%
And I went, oh, OK.

00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking,
well, there's something

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:10%
she's going to say that's going
to be significant and telling.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
We go to lunch at a beautiful,
beautiful restaurant

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:90%
in a town in Orange County.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:10%
You wouldn't believe there's
a nice restaurant like this

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:10%
there, but we met at this
beautiful restaurant.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:10%
They grow their own
vegetables, et cetera,

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.080 align:middle line:10%
and that's part of
the salad, and it's

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:10%
just a really nice atmosphere.
Love seeing her.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:10%
She was down from Colorado
to see her mother.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And we chatted a little
bit, get acquainted.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I noticed off to-- we're facing
her-- off to her left side,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.485 align:middle line:90%
there's this tan, beige bag.

00:12:26.485 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And I was curious.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what that is.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Her purse or something.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes into our exchange she
says, I have something for you.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Pulls out the bag, zips it
open, pulls out a drum that she

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:90%
made for me as a thank you.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, beautiful
handmade drum.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:90%
She makes a lot of drums.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.020 align:middle line:90%
And this one was really special.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And she went on and
explained exactly

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
how it was made, which part of
the moose was used, et cetera.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:10%
Long story, but the point
being is clear, clear

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:10%
message from hawk brother.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
The other-- again, I have
stories after stores.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can tell you--

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And I have lots of questions.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Please, go with the questions.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.050 align:middle line:90%
That was a long story.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
No, I love it because
you are so passionate.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I just absolutely love it.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And you definitely-- what
are the other-- there's

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:90%
animals they can give a sign.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But what are some other things
that we can use to open up

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
to this unseen world?

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Again-- well, first I want
to say the way that we get

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
messages, whether it's
from plants-- which,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.670 align:middle line:84%
tree is a plant, but tree,
I separate that sometimes

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
in my mind-- and
certainly animals,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:90%
but we get it from the wind.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
We get it from the ocean.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:90%
We get it from the moon.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of really listening.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
listening, what I mean

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
is that we listen not
just with our eyes,

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
not just with our ears, not just
with our senses, but all three.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.260 align:middle line:10%
And typically, I suggest to
people-- there's, for instance,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:10%
spirits of nature divination.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Divination is meaning
getting messages.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically you
go outside anywhere.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Could be a beach like
this or could be a forest

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:90%
or mountains or desert.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And you think of a question
that you want to ask a spirit,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:10%
and particularly
through expressing

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:10%
through or as these
nature spirits.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
You think of the
question, close your eyes.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Take about three deep breaths.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Get really grounded.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Feel your connection to
the earth and to the sky.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Just really get grounded.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And then ask as
you open your eyes,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.475 align:middle line:84%
see what your
attention is drawn to.

00:14:33.475 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It could be this rock over here.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:90%
It might be the ocean.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
It might be the tree over here.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:90%
It might be an animal.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It might be one of the
birds that's flying around.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You see-- and listen
how I say this too.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Where your attention is drawn.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Not where you look.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Not in the active sense.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
You would call it grammatically
the passive tense.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We see where your
attention is drawn.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And when your attention is drawn
there, you ask the question,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:90%
are you my teacher?

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's say to that rock,
are you my teacher?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And then you listen.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And you will get a clear
sense of yes or no.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
You might hear it,
you might feel it.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And let's say if
you get a no, then

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
you move on until you're
drawn to something else,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:90%
until you get a yes.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that
rock, you just

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:90%
get a feeling that it's, yes.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:90%
You are my teacher.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:84%
What you do then is
you ask your question.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you ask your
question-- rock spirit,

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
here's my question--
and I do mean this,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'll stress this-- pay
attention to everything that--

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:90%
360.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
happens after that.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You might be drawn back,
and your attention's

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.370 align:middle line:90%
drawn to the ocean.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
You hear something about go
with the waves, you know?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Your rock might say, look
how strong and steady I am.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, nothing
will wear me down

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:90%
except a long bout with water.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to your emotions.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm drawn to the water.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
I look up at this
plant here, and spend

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:90%
some time hanging around.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to keep
doing all the time.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these kind
of things may come through.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And all those things probably
are true for me right now,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
as I demonstrate that.
Tree.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:10%
You go up to a tree.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:10%
Sit by a tree for a while.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:10%
Put your backbone
against the tree.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:10%
Say, tree spirit, teach me.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:10%
Teach me what I need to know.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:10%
I did this once, and one piece
that I got from this asking

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:10%
tree spirit when
I was questioning,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:10%
because it's good to do
this once in a while.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, is my work really helping
people, and blah, blah, blah.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
It's good to do that.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Just step back from it.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But not try to figure the
answer out, but get the answer.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So I put my back against a tree
and I said, teach me, tree.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:10%
And tree, best way
I could describe

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:10%
it was a feeling and auditory.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:90%
I was hearing and feeling it.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw this
vision of the roots,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.291 align:middle line:84%
that the ones that immediately
come from the tree, you

00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:90%
can see.

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But then the others
go way underground.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't see them.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:10%
And the message was very
clear, is that you can't always

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:10%
see the impact that you have
on people, just like the work

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:10%
that you're doing.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:10%
You don't always see it,
but I know that you do.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:10%
You impact people
from your work.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.313 align:middle line:84%
Make sense?
-Yes.

00:17:14.313 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It perfectly makes sense.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
And you speak also of
memories, cellular memories.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.785 align:middle line:10%
How can we-- does that link
also to being even more

00:17:23.785 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:10%
so open to spirit
world when we start

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to release some old memories,
when the soul starts to heal?

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And is there, like, also this
healing process that needs

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to occur for us to be even
clearer channels, if I can say,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of messages, spirit?
-Yes.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, we can
employ the assistance

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:90%
of any kind of spirit guides.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
My take on it,
Lilou, is in a sense,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter who you
pray to or who you work with.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's archangels,
maybe it's God,

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Jesus, Buddha, animal spirits.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I have a 25,000 year old
being who finally said

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I could say his
name. [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:90%
I met in a shamanic initiation.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:90%
He works with me.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.167 align:middle line:84%
I work with him.
I'm not sure how to say it.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
We work with one another.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:90%
But he teaches me and guides me.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we open
ourselves to the world

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:90%
of spirit, something shifts.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned the term
awakening process.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Something shifts inside us.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Does it change us at
the level of our DNA?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't prove it.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't prove it,
but I do believe.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it starts
adjusting the cells.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard these
stories of miracles

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:90%
that have been created.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
People with life threatening
illnesses that go home and do

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the work that they
need to do, and go back

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:90%
to the doctor two years later.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Doctor says, wow.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.120 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:90%
How did you do this?

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And often medical science,
in the traditional way,

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.270 align:middle line:90%
can't believe in miracles.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
But I think we have to.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's miraculous to me
to sit here and do this, what

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
we're doing, to be able to just
stop and listen to the ocean,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and how the ocean
continues to grow.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Or when we go out
and watch-- like,

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I planted some corn
and other vegetables.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And to go out day after day
and watch how that-- wow.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:90%
It just grows.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going off on a bit of a
tangent from your question.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
No, but you're
speaking of opening up

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to all these small things
probably that we don't really

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:90%
pay attention to in our lives.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And this opens up our spirit
world to see the intangible,

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and heal from those
different aspects.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Nature naturally heals.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And the words that come
to mind as we discuss this

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:84%
is, slow down.
[SIGH]

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's-- yeah.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I take a breath even
when I say that,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
because I get caught
up in the hurry

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.050 align:middle line:84%
up sickness that is just
a little too prominent

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
in our culture, in our society.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Turtle.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Turtle spirit.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
When I did-- my first book
was "Sacred Ceremony."

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the next book
is "Power Animals."

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's 36-- it's a start
with the spirit animal thing.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It was the first step.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
36 spirit animals
with a CD in it

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:84%
where you're guided to
get your power animal,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to find out what spirit
animal is most helpful to you.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a power animal.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a long-term
relationship, basically.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:10%
And I would sit-- it was
so fascinating to me.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:84%
I would sit usually at
night, because that's when

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:90%
I often do my best writing.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd ask each one at a
time, these 36 animals one

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:90%
at a time, what's your message?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And turtle.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
It was so fast-- it
cracks me up still

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:90%
when I think of this story.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing away, and I'm
in a little mild trance.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to access
the communication from spirit,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.410 align:middle line:84%
we need to slow down our
bodies and our senses

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:90%
so we can be open to it.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
When we do slow down
like that, then it

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
makes it much more
possible for spirit

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to collaborate with
us in this way.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm writing.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I said, turtle,
what's your message?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind my
inner voice-- this

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:29.346 align:middle line:84%
is exactly how it sounded--
(SPEAKING SLOWLY) slow down.

00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got all the
time in the world.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And I went into a deeper trance
when I heard that, you know?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then continued with
a lengthier message.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But basically, that
was turtle's message.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And turtle has come to
me about a year ago,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
and repeatedly came
to me again and again

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and again, symbolically
and in the physical form.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And I finally said, are
you joining the crew here?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, are you
another power animal?

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I work with-- right
now I work with four, mainly.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's enough.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That's enough for the
shamanic work that I do.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And turtle went,
(SPEAKING SLOWLY) yeah.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:90%
In that same voice.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So turtle's been
working with me.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And at this era in our history,
and also for me personally,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:90%
good message.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Good reminder.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Don't rush through to
where my consciousness

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.742 align:middle line:90%
gets ahead of my body.

00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many of us do
that when that hurry up--

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:84%
-Not in the present moment.
-Yeah.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult-- how can
you be if you're thinking,

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can't wait to get over to
that other side of the beach.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Then your thoughts and your
consciousness is over there,

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:90%
but you're not in your body.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:48.225 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I would say, a
real symptom of our culture

00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:50.515 align:middle line:84%
is so many of us
are out of body.

00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And plus what I said is that
we have separated the spiritual

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:90%
from the material.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:58.886 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening now
is we're recognizing,

00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
no, that it's all unified.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:90%
That God is in the trees.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:90%
God is in you.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
God is in me, and
Dennis, and the whales

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that we occasionally
see here coming

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.956 align:middle line:90%
up to about this time of year.

00:23:14.956 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So the memory, to go back
to the cellular memory

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and the awakening
process and all of that,

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:90%
when does that best occur then?

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.996 align:middle line:84%
What is needed for us to
open up to the spirit world?

00:23:29.996 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think that
that's-- Lilou, I

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.381 align:middle line:84%
think that goes and starts in--
-Slowing down.

00:23:34.381 --> 00:23:35.385 align:middle line:84%
Stops.
[LAUGH]

00:23:35.385 --> 00:23:36.084 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:36.084 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Slowing down would
be the first thing.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:10%
Second is, have a spiritual
discipline of some sort.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
A simple one like
with food is prayers.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't-- I have a prayer
that I've been really focused

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
on doing this as much
as I can remember,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
and not get in a hurry
to do, which is to pray.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:84%
When I sit down before
a meal, whether home

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
cooked or out at a
restaurant, is just

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
to say a prayer of gratitude.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the beings
that have given their lives,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
plants and animals,
so that I can continue

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:90%
mine for yet another day.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there may
be other blessings,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.645 align:middle line:84%
or thank you for the blessings
that we have in our lives.

00:24:15.645 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'd say slow down.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Establish a
spiritual discipline.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Could be meditation.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Yoga can be a
spiritual discipline.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.216 align:middle line:90%
Tai Chi.

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I found doing both of
those over the years,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
those are incredible
spiritual disciplines.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:90%
Going to the gym, maybe.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure about
weightlifting, but it could be.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:10%
But something that requires
your focus on spirit in whatever

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:10%
form that takes.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Third, get outside.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Go for walk in nature.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I often prescribe to people
to do a walking meditation.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese
Buddhist monk, where you slow

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:90%
down maybe 80% of your pace.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.792 align:middle line:84%
And just move at a much--
not a ra-- yeah, I know.

00:25:06.792 --> 00:25:08.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Try it for five minutes, folks.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a challenge.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It's much more-- especially if
you're accustomed to that hurry

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
up, getting to the next step,
getting from point A to point B

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than being
right here at point A.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing
is to get outdoors too

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy the natural world.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The natural world is just,
again, it's miraculous.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And just to go out
with that in mind

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
is just to appreciate
what's there.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:84%
The fourth, and I've
mentioned this, is gratitude.

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.526 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.526 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
How much we truly have
to be grateful for.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's been said so many times.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful piece
by David Steindl-Rast

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:90%
that talks about that.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:90%
He says, this is it.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the day that's
been gifted to you.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm paraphrasing what he said.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.170 align:middle line:90%
This is a gift.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Treat it as a gift.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And the best response to
the gift is gratitude.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:84%
To be grateful for the
opportunity to come down here

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to this wonderful beach and
do this interview on, again,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the best beaches
in Laguna Beach,

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:90%
if not Southern California.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And share in an exchange
like this that will go out

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
to a number of
people, and hopefully

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:84%
will inspire some to do
some of these things.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:90%
To get outside.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:90%
Go sit by a tree.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Sit by a tree.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Put your back against
a tree and just say,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.650 align:middle line:90%
tree spirit-- close your eyes.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe this, by the way.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.691 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe it
or disbelieve it.

00:26:34.691 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Try it.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You can even do it at home
maybe, feeling the tree also.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.411 align:middle line:84%
Or does it need to
be physically a tree?

00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Good question.
And I prefer to say get outside.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But you could do
it in a meditation.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I just think it becomes that
much more-- because we're

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
physical beings, if we
can make physical contact

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
with the world in
some way, it just adds

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:90%
a little extra oomph to it.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you could
do it at home.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Just like any meditation,
you can visualize or feel

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
or just sense that tree rubbing
up against your backbone,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.535 align:middle line:84%
or sitting there
with the backbone.

00:27:06.535 --> 00:27:09.295 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:11.632 align:middle line:90%
It reminds me of another--

00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
You have helicopters here, huh?

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's our military
base down South Pendleton.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.481 align:middle line:84%
We had it last time too in
our last other interview,

00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember.
-Yes.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We made jokes about it
and here it is again.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.914 align:middle line:90%
There it is again, yeah.

00:27:23.914 --> 00:27:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You should see them
when it's summertime.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They frequently go back
and forth along the beach.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the Marines like to
check out who's on the beach,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.930 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I had a healing from
a tree years ago.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I wrote about this in
my book "Earth Magic."

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was very, very real.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The short story was I
twisted my back dancing,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and I was really sore.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:10%
And I was in the
middle of an assignment

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:10%
that spirit gave me,
specifically [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:10%
the one I mentioned
before, to go

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:10%
out and just learn from tree.

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'd sit with tree every day.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd offer tobacco and
I'd sit with tree.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the third,
maybe the fourth day.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
That's when I had a sore
back and I said, OK.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do this.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Lunchtime.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Had lunch, went back
out to the tree,

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:84%
offered tobacco, sat
against the tree,

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and was prepared to
ask for teaching.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Tell me anything
else I need to know.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:10%
And then it occurred to me,
why not ask for healing?

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, tree spirit, I'd like
you to heal my back, please.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Sat there, breathed with
the tree, a few minutes.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Got up and ah, man.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.815 align:middle line:90%
Still sore.

00:28:38.815 --> 00:28:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, well.

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:90%
It was worth a shot.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Try it out, like I tell people.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Try it out.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:90%
See what happens.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Went and listened to the
lecture for about an hour.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Got up at the break.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Walked to get some tea
or something like that.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And after about 10 steps
I went, wait a minute.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:90%
You were not hurting anymore.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Swear.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I Swear to God.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Or swear to tree.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.485 align:middle line:10%
So back to your
question about cellular,

00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:10%
yeah, our cells are changing.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on a
proposal for a book

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
right now that will
be a book-- I know it

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.980 align:middle line:90%
will-- healing ancestral karma.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And it goes into a lot of that--
it addresses that question

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:84%
quite extensively is that,
we come into this world

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:90%
with a certain karma.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We certainly are influenced
by the external experiences

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:90%
that come from the outside.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is a souls karma
that comes from our ancestors,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and that is both at
the spiritual level

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.540 align:middle line:90%
as well as the genetic level.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
we're not stuck with that.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And what will change our
karma-- psychology can help.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think ultimately it has
to lead to a spiritual journey

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
to change that karma.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I know people, and myself.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I look at myself and how
I've changed over the years.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I was really a
pretty messed up kid.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Shy, withdrawn, real
watcher, you know?

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Careful about being with people.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I cannot tell you how I was
called to be in situations that

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:84%
forced me to come out of
that hard shell that was

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:90%
around me for so many years.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:90%
One thing after another.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need to go into
a lot of stories about that.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But just know that there was one
experience and one experience,

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.790 align:middle line:90%
another one.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And each one pushed me out
further out of my comfort zone

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and into this path here.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I was a psychotherapist
for a number of years.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of therapy
to do some healing.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I was just called to do it.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I had to.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
God sort of kicked my
rear end a couple times.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.295 align:middle line:84%
And that's sometimes
forces us-- I

00:30:55.295 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:84%
call it the two by four approach
where he hits us with a two

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
by four, and it's either
you go down in the spiral,

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
or you wake up.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Like the stick of awakening
in that Buddhist practice.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:90%
So we can change that.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And what happens as we work
with it in any of these ways

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:84%
that I'm describing
here, is we change

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:90%
at a very fundamental level.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm the same, but
I'm so much different than I

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:90%
was, say, even 20 years ago.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.475 align:middle line:84%
And if I look at
40 years ago, I'm

00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:90%
going jeez, who was that guy?

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I know it's me.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:90%
It was me, I think.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was so different.
Isn't that true?

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't you notice that?

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And those kids, you
feel they have more

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:90%
or less-- more karma or not?

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think they're
more aware and available

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and here and talking to spirit
because they have less of it?

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.170 align:middle line:84%
They have not only
less of it, but they've

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:84%
got parents and others
who influence them,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that are encouraging them
to be open to spirit.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I've recently been called
to do children's products,

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
which I never would've
thought five years ago

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd be doing them.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We came up-- and this was
actually Jessica's idea.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
the power animal

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
cards and the other oracle
cards I do, and she says,

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:90%
you should do one for kids.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And I pitched it
to one publisher.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't do too many
children's products.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Then I was talking with Karen
Stuth of Satiama, website

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
satiama.com, who's
really trying to get--

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:84%
she's on a mission
to really encourage

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:90%
us to be attuned to spirit.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
And she said, let's do it.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:90%
I told her about the cards.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
She said, let's
do it, and we did.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And these cards,
called "Children's

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Spirit Animal Cards," 24 cards.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.715 align:middle line:84%
Great illustrations by
Pamela Anzalotti is her name.

00:32:42.715 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:90%
She really nailed it.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Simple messages.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Basically values
on the messages.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Guidebook that has a
section for parents.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
How to work with the
children with these cards.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.780 align:middle line:84%
For children, older
children who can read.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:84%
That's basically six
to maybe 10 or 11.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard three-year-olds
love to play with them,

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:90%
like the pictures, et cetera.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And not that it's
the only instrument,

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's one way that it
can encourage both parents

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and children--
encourage children,

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:84%
but also encourage parents with
children to tune into spirit

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:90%
more through the animals.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love this whole
thing with animal spirit

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
guides, is it makes it
so much more accessible

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
both for children and adults.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a workshop for
parents and children in Florida

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:90%
a few months back.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That was six delightful children
that were in that workshop,

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and their parents
or grandparents.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And this one little
girl Joanie, I

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:84%
remember her
because of something

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.180 align:middle line:90%
she said later to her mom.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I learned that she
was taught to meditate

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:90%
when she was a year old.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how, or
what the meditation was.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But she came out one
day, probably a year

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and a half old to
the kitchen where

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:84%
her mother was busy and said,
Mommy, I want to meditate.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And mommy said, I
can't right now.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I've got things to do.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And she had a tantrum because
she couldn't meditate.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:90%
That's telling right there.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And the openness and
the love these children

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.610 align:middle line:84%
have for the animals,
for instance.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:10%
And the parents, I
congratulate the parents

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:10%
who are facilitating
this, who are

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.770 align:middle line:10%
making room for these children.
So, yeah.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.760 align:middle line:10%
They come in with certain karma.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.860 align:middle line:10%
But again, the blessing
is they have parents

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.590 align:middle line:10%
who are able to work
with them to help

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:10%
remember who we really are in
this whole scheme of things.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.911 align:middle line:84%
And they remind
the parents too.

00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGH]
-All the time.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Don't they always.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.476 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:53.476 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:90%
It works the other way around.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, this has been
amazing, Steven.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:10%
Is there anything else
that comes to your mind

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.600 align:middle line:10%
that you would like to share
as part of this conversation,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:10%
as teachings, of course, and
your message about spirit,

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:10%
about opening up,
about awakening,

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.311 align:middle line:10%
about maybe ascension or these
times, these particular times?

00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
I mean, I could say a lot.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I think since as this
interview is being taped,

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.100 align:middle line:84%
we're close to that
magic marker, you know?

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.909 align:middle line:84%
December 21.
12/21/12.

00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's two things
I think about that.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
One is it's not as big a
deal as everybody makes it,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%
quite frankly.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I just don't think so.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like an event of something.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:90%
No, we're already in process.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
There's dramatic
changes going on.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody read the
papers or watched the news?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
There's incredible
changes going on,

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and it is going to require
us to adapt and to adjust

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.730 align:middle line:90%
as a species, as human species.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a cleansing that's
going on, quite frankly.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's, like, wanting
to do this ascension thing.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have a point
of view about that.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I think we should talk about
descending, being on the earth,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
learning how to live with the
Earth more than ascending.

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.652 align:middle line:84%
That to me sounds very
similar to rise above it

00:36:10.652 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:84%
or just when you get into
a certain consciousness,

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to elevate off the
earth or something like that.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I never quite understood
it, but that's me.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.230 align:middle line:90%
That's just me.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:90%
My name is Farmer.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm triple earth sign.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Iowa, the Midwest.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm real-- grr.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.152 align:middle line:84%
Real grounded.
-Spirit, yeah.

00:36:27.152 --> 00:36:28.185 align:middle line:90%
So ground yourself, descending.

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can see that.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And to learn to-- remember
to relate to the earth.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Relate to the--
it's not the earth.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to save the earth.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.200 align:middle line:84%
We need to revise our
relationship with the earth.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.030 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.241 align:middle line:90%
The earth's doing fine.

00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been around for four
and a half billion years.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
continue on for a while.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And we just need to readjust our
ways of relating to the earth.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're going to enter
into this next cycle, 2013.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:90%
It's some ways very exciting.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It can be scary.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we focus on
the fear, it's not helping.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude, the things I said.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Get outside.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Learn to relate to the
plants and the trees

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and the animals in
a different way.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And every day,
like Eva says, she

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.840 align:middle line:84%
starts-- the Cherokee way is to
start every day with gratitude.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Sing songs of
gratitude every day,

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
or just make a list of 10
things that you're grateful for.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
More and more as I go
on, Lilou, I really

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:84%
think-- I keep that in mind
as much as possible to,

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
if I get in a grumpy mood
or something like that,

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.050 align:middle line:84%
is get out of it as
quickly as possible.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do is look
around and remind myself what

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm really, truly grateful for.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:10%
What a privilege to live
at this era in our planet.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there's lifetimes
before and lifetimes after,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.900 align:middle line:90%
but this is where I am now.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:10%
So to enjoy, to be of service,
to offer whatever I can

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:10%
to the world and to
the people around me,

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:10%
and close in as well as more
the larger, extended clan.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
delicious moment.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
and sharing this video.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.960 align:middle line:84%
This was another beautiful
interview for Gaiam TV

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.820 align:middle line:90%
even Steven Farmer.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And if people want to know
more, go to my website.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It's called earthmagic.net.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Free oracle card
readings, all sorts

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:90%
articles and stuff like that.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's been my pleasure, Lilou.
Thank you.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:90%
You're still on radio?

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.230 align:middle line:84%
No I dropped the radio,
because I'm going to be-- I'm

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:30.430 align:middle line:84%
working on a book, and I
just felt done with it.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:90%
I felt complete.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be on other people's
radio stations and TV shows.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's another
important thing to move on

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and to follow our
intuition and to also

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.891 align:middle line:84%
clear some things for other
things to come in, huh?

00:38:41.891 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Good point.
Yeah.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.554 align:middle line:84%
It was beginning to
feel-- I was just--

00:38:45.554 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the best way I can describe
it, I just felt complete.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, OK.
I'm done with this part.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I'd done radio
for several years.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not
happening anymore,

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.170 align:middle line:84%
then it is time to move
on, whatever that is.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Much, much love.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Blessings.
Bye-bye.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]
