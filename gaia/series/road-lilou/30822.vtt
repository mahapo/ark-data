[ Music ]

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:11.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello my beautiful
co-creators.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.214 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:16.283 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, delicious
interview with Gay Hendricks.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.284 align:middle line:90%
Hello Gay.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:17.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay Hendricks: Hello, Lilou.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.253 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you again.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Good to see you
in Ojai in your own home.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.924 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Here I am in my
own piece of paradise.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and this is
really a special place.

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.896 align:middle line:84%
This is your office where a lot
of your creation takes place.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.166 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the; how
do you say that?

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.868 align:middle line:90%
The one on ones as well?

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:35.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Yes, if you'd
peeked in the window

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:37.938 align:middle line:84%
at five thirty you would have
seen me over there working

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.209 align:middle line:84%
on my new mystery novel and if
you'd peeked in there yesterday

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.412 align:middle line:84%
at 3 o'clock you'd have seen
me coaching a CEO somewhere

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.782 align:middle line:84%
on the other end of the
country and done on Skype video.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot of my work
right here in this room.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I've got it set up so
all my audio equipment is here.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.994 align:middle line:84%
I can record things here and
shoot videos here and listen

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:03.296 align:middle line:84%
to music here, so Katie [assumed
spelling] has helped me decorate

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:04.899 align:middle line:84%
it so that it has
such good vibes

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.201 align:middle line:84%
that I hardly ever
want to leave.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:11.238 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love how; what,
first of all you wrote 36 books.

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:14.275 align:middle line:84%
We spoke of The Big Leap
of; many of your books

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:16.911 align:middle line:84%
on the relationship and
now you have The Rule.

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.146 align:middle line:90%
The Latest Baby is here.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.782 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Yes, the Latest
Baby is a mystery novel.

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.984 align:middle line:84%
It's; I fell in love
with mysteries

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:25.252 align:middle line:90%
when I was 12 years old.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:29.823 align:middle line:84%
I read my first Sherlock
Holmes story and I was hooked.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.026 align:middle line:84%
In fact I read so many
Sherlock Holmes books

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:35.196 align:middle line:84%
that my English teacher; my
9th grade English teacher;

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:38.265 align:middle line:84%
called me Sherlock
as my nickname.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.468 align:middle line:84%
And so for 50 years I've wanted
to write my own mystery novel

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.571 align:middle line:84%
and so a couple of
years ago I did it.

00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a mystery novel about
a Tibetan Buddhist private

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.843 align:middle line:84%
detective in Los Angeles
and now, Hay House is

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:53.647 align:middle line:84%
about to publish number 2
in the series and I have;

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.549 align:middle line:90%
I'm now working on number 4.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.153 align:middle line:84%
So I've got 4 of them
written, working so far.

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:01.121 align:middle line:84%
And Hay House is going
to be bringing them out;

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.457 align:middle line:84%
all of them out over the
next couple of years.

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's really
fascinating to see

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.928 align:middle line:84%
because you had the Stanford
University background.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:11.332 align:middle line:84%
I mean you studied in those
wonderful universities.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:14.235 align:middle line:84%
You taught in the University
of Colorado, is that right?

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:17.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Yes, well my main
field was Counseling Psychology

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:84%
and so my Doctorate
from Stanford is

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.677 align:middle line:84%
in Counseling Psychology
and when I was a kid also,

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:25.613 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted to be
a university professor

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.315 align:middle line:84%
and so I became a
university professor

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:29.416 align:middle line:90%
after I finished Stanford.

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:31.352 align:middle line:84%
I went to the University
of Colorado

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.988 align:middle line:84%
and I was a professor
there for 21 years.

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:36.924 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
Katie and I decided

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:41.395 align:middle line:84%
to stop writing textbooks
and start writing books

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.630 align:middle line:90%
for the general public

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.532 align:middle line:84%
and a young lady named
Oprah Winfrey called one day

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.434 align:middle line:84%
and said hey, I like the
kind of stuff you're doing.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.469 align:middle line:90%
I've got this TV show.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:49.703 align:middle line:90%
You want to come on it?

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.674 align:middle line:84%
And so we did that and
suddenly 20 years later now

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.977 align:middle line:84%
and a million frequent flyer
miles later, here we are.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:00.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Did you believe it
for example when Oprah knocks

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:01.649 align:middle line:90%
at your door and called you?

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.285 align:middle line:90%
Was it an immediate yes or?

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:07.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well, it's actually
an interesting story

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
because the first
time, I actually turned

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
down the opportunity
to be on the show.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.096 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could believe it at the
time but I had; they called just

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:20.234 align:middle line:84%
as I was getting off the plane
in Hawaii one time and asked me

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.436 align:middle line:84%
if I could do the
show and I thought oh.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.639 align:middle line:84%
And they said can you turn
around and come back to Chicago?

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.877 align:middle line:84%
And it was 80 degrees there
at the airport in Kauai.

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:34.648 align:middle line:84%
And it was like 12 degrees
in Chicago and I said oh no,

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do that.

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:38.319 align:middle line:90%
I just got here, you know.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.586 align:middle line:90%
And he said come on, you know?

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:44.024 align:middle line:84%
And so I may be the first
self-help book author in history

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:46.026 align:middle line:84%
to have turned down
an opportunity to be

00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.162 align:middle line:84%
on the Oprah show
the first time.

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:51.165 align:middle line:84%
But then later on when
Conscious Loving came out,

00:03:51.165 --> 00:03:52.766 align:middle line:90%
then it all worked out great.

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:56.203 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
called we said sure.

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So I would
love to get more

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.008 align:middle line:84%
of this conversation you
know on relationships

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:02.743 align:middle line:84%
and your recommendation
and what you learned

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.411 align:middle line:84%
because you are really
definitely one

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:90%
of the world expert on that.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is a privilege to have
you here and what a joy to share

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.752 align:middle line:84%
that with everybody
watching around the world,

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:84%
because of course with
all these time change

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle line:84%
and everything we're
going through,

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:18.392 align:middle line:84%
relationships are
shaking up a little bit.

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:19.692 align:middle line:90%
> Gay: Very much so.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:24.264 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is one of the
most difficult times to be

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.736 align:middle line:84%
in relationship and it's also
one of the most rewarding times,

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:32.339 align:middle line:84%
if you can kind of learn
sort of basic things.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:35.809 align:middle line:84%
Like one of the big things that
makes relationships succeed

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:39.513 align:middle line:84%
or fail is whether both people
are honest about their feelings.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.615 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether you
can say to the person,

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:43.183 align:middle line:90%
I felt hurt when you said that.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:45.219 align:middle line:84%
Or I felt angry when
you said that.

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.187 align:middle line:90%
Or I feel scared right now.

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not sure what
I want right now.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.025 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you can be
honest in relationships,

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
that is like the life blood
of relationships and yet many

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.301 align:middle line:84%
of us learn, you know, to
keep things all tucked inside

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and it really costs
us in relationship.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
A second thing that makes
relationships work is

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.176 align:middle line:84%
when both people are willing
to take responsibility

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:90%
for things rather than blame.

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.682 align:middle line:84%
Blame is probably the number
one eroder of intimacy

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.285 align:middle line:84%
in relationships;
criticism and blame.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:23.323 align:middle line:84%
And so most criticism is not
really about the other person.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.793 align:middle line:84%
It's about some unlovable
part of yourself

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:28.729 align:middle line:84%
that you're projecting
onto the other person.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.467 align:middle line:84%
And so the key thing is to
find out where you blame

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:36.103 align:middle line:84%
and then gradually learn to
take responsibility for that.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So you say okay, I'm dreaming
up this scenario here.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.544 align:middle line:84%
You know the moment you
realize oh, I'm dreaming

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:84%
up my life exactly
the way I want it.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Hmmm. Maybe I ought to
put some conscious thought

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.118 align:middle line:90%
into how I want it rather

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:54.154 align:middle line:84%
than letting my unconscious
run the show you know,

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:58.025 align:middle line:84%
because my unconscious was not
doing a very good job in my 20's

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:01.028 align:middle line:84%
of helping me lead a
good relationship life,

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
because I messed up one
relationship after the other

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.232 align:middle line:90%
by not being honest

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:09.703 align:middle line:84%
or not taking responsibility
or cheating.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't learn until well
into my 20's in how I messed

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.876 align:middle line:84%
up a bunch of relationships,
that you really have

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.645 align:middle line:84%
to be impeccable with your
agreements in relationship.

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:22.749 align:middle line:84%
You can't; I can't make an
agreement to be faithful to you

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.486 align:middle line:90%
and then go out and cheat on you

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:28.655 align:middle line:84%
without that causing
tremendous rattle and

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:32.793 align:middle line:84%
yet it's probably the
most popular indoor sport

00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:34.094 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:40.467 align:middle line:84%
And recent studies indicate
women are even more likely

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:43.136 align:middle line:84%
to have outside affairs
than men are now

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.438 align:middle line:90%
at this stage of evolution.

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:45.772 align:middle line:90%
So I found that hard to believe

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:49.343 align:middle line:84%
that when I first
read those statistics.

00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.978 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, it doesn't
matter whether you're male

00:06:50.978 --> 00:06:52.279 align:middle line:90%
or female or what.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:56.383 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we've all got
to learn that if we bottle

00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.151 align:middle line:84%
up the things that
are inside us,

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:00.954 align:middle line:84%
the things that are inside
of us will eat us up.

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.258 align:middle line:84%
And if we let forth those
things, if we let things flow,

00:07:04.258 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:84%
we get to have a life
that's built on flow.

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:09.997 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
learn only keep secrets

00:07:09.997 --> 00:07:11.565 align:middle line:84%
where they're absolutely
necessary.

00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:13.901 align:middle line:84%
Like if you know the
secret formula of Coca-Cola

00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
or something, you don't have to
go out and spread that around.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.542 align:middle line:84%
But other than something like
that, there are no secrets

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in relationships that
are worth destroying your

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.212 align:middle line:90%
relationship over.

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:27.848 align:middle line:84%
And yet every day
here, I see people here

00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:30.117 align:middle line:84%
who are destroying their
relationships by trying

00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:35.188 align:middle line:84%
to be dishonest with
their primary relationship

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:37.624 align:middle line:84%
and so anyway, it's
a national disgrace.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.892 align:middle line:90%
A national hazard.

00:07:38.892 --> 00:07:42.829 align:middle line:84%
It's a health hazard too
because relationship stress is

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:46.033 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion one of
the major hidden causes

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.534 align:middle line:90%
of actually physical illness.

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.003 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of studies on that.

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:51.538 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I've
seen studies that say

00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:58.111 align:middle line:84%
that getting a cold is
almost always preceded

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:02.983 align:middle line:84%
by some emotional upset within
the few days before that.

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:84%
And so these things
have an effect

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.955 align:middle line:90%
on our physical system too.

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:11.525 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to learn how all
to be masters of relationship

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.327 align:middle line:84%
and you know, it's
just like most

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.495 align:middle line:90%
of us are masters of gravity.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.031 align:middle line:84%
We learn to walk around
without falling over.

00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Well we could do the same
thing in relationship.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.536 align:middle line:84%
We can learn mastery of
relationship so we can be

00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:24.671 align:middle line:84%
in relationship without
falling over.

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
set of skills.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.477 align:middle line:84%
But learning to ride a
bicycle seems impossible

00:08:30.477 --> 00:08:31.912 align:middle line:90%
when you first try it.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.681 align:middle line:90%
I know it did to me, you know?

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.782 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs].But then a few
blocks later, oh, okay,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:37.917 align:middle line:90%
it has some rules to it.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:42.089 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, did
you have even 10 minutes

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:45.092 align:middle line:84%
of useful training in your
entire high school education

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:47.361 align:middle line:84%
of about how relationships
worked?

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:49.196 align:middle line:84%
I've asked that question
all over the world

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:51.598 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
what everybody says.

00:08:51.598 --> 00:08:55.102 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't it have been
nice to spend an hour

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:58.605 align:middle line:84%
in high school learning how to
communicate with other people

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:00.107 align:middle line:90%
or how to solve a problem

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:02.075 align:middle line:84%
without making the
other person wrong?

00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:05.012 align:middle line:84%
Or how to take responsibility
for something

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.381 align:middle line:84%
without blaming yourself
or the other person?

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.116 align:middle line:90%
These are incredible skills and

00:09:09.116 --> 00:09:11.785 align:middle line:84%
yet I don't see them being
taught out there very much.

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:14.721 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of my
life missions is to get

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:17.891 align:middle line:84%
as many people as possible
thinking about and talking

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:21.228 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that they
can create heaven on earth

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:22.329 align:middle line:90%
in their relationships.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.064 align:middle line:84%
It takes a little
bit of discipline.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But you know, my wife and I
when we first got together,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.338 align:middle line:84%
we set some big, kind of
tall challenges to ourselves.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:35.609 align:middle line:84%
One challenge we set for
ourselves was to eliminate blame

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:37.711 align:middle line:84%
and criticism from
our relationship.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:39.713 align:middle line:84%
Because both of us had
grown up in families

00:09:39.713 --> 00:09:42.182 align:middle line:84%
that are very critical
and blameful.

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.818 align:middle line:84%
And we started out in our
relationship criticizing each

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:48.488 align:middle line:84%
other and bickering, you
know, just like our parents.

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:50.624 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly one day we woke up

00:09:50.624 --> 00:09:52.926 align:middle line:84%
and wait a minute;
what are we doing?

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.897 align:middle line:84%
Do we really want to do anything
like that in our relationship?

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:84%
We just fell into
a habit of that.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:03.303 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I didn't wake
up in the morning and say okay,

00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.572 align:middle line:84%
today I'm going to spend
a lot of time figuring

00:10:05.572 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
out what's wrong with Katie.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.445 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was just
unconscious habit patterns based

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.914 align:middle line:84%
on stuff I'd seen
around me growing up.

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:16.216 align:middle line:84%
I grew up where people were
bickering constantly and so

00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:18.985 align:middle line:84%
that just seemed like that's
the way life is supposed to be.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:22.689 align:middle line:84%
And but Katie and I decided to
eliminate blame and criticism

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:24.624 align:middle line:90%
from our relationship.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.959 align:middle line:90%
And it was a big commitment

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.128 align:middle line:84%
and it actually took us
a few years to do it.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:32.432 align:middle line:84%
But now, at least for
the past 15 years or so,

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle line:84%
neither one of us has said
a single word of blame

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.903 align:middle line:84%
or criticism to the
other person.

00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:41.575 align:middle line:84%
And imagine the amount
of easeful creative space

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:45.145 align:middle line:84%
that opens up when nobody
is criticizing anybody.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I just had a; I just
did an interview in French

00:10:47.247 --> 00:10:49.716 align:middle line:84%
and this lady wrote a book
about criticism and all that

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.686 align:middle line:84%
and then she replaced it with
celebrations and acknowledgment

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:54.888 align:middle line:90%
and gratitude and celebrating.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.924 align:middle line:84%
Because once we don't
blame, what do we do?

00:10:57.924 --> 00:10:58.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: Exactly.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:90%
Well here's what you do.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's a lot of space
to do some other things, right?

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:06.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well, we say that
relationships come in 3 flavors.

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.335 align:middle line:84%
The first one, which is
an unpleasant flavor,

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:90%
is called toxic relationships.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.507 align:middle line:84%
And about 1 out of 20
by our rough count;

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:16.476 align:middle line:84%
about one out of 20
relationships are toxic

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:20.347 align:middle line:84%
relationships where they are
really making both people sick

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.481 align:middle line:90%
in some way, you know?

00:11:21.481 --> 00:11:24.584 align:middle line:84%
They're draining energy,
they're having a toll.

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:27.587 align:middle line:84%
Being in the relationship
is eating both people up.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:31.124 align:middle line:84%
So; but that's not
very many, you know?

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.293 align:middle line:84%
Like 1 out of 20 is not
very many people have

00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:34.661 align:middle line:90%
toxic relationships.

00:11:34.661 --> 00:11:38.999 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority are what we
call learning relationships,

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:41.968 align:middle line:84%
where you're learning something
you really need to learn

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:43.737 align:middle line:90%
in order to have more love.

00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:46.173 align:middle line:84%
In order to have a
better flow of love,

00:11:46.173 --> 00:11:49.142 align:middle line:84%
you're learning something
that you need to learn.

00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:55.816 align:middle line:84%
And that's about 18 of
those 20 relationships.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:12:00.086 align:middle line:84%
So toxic, 1 out of 20;
learning, 18 out of 20.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:03.523 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other end
is what we call celebratory;

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:04.791 align:middle line:90%
celebration.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:09.062 align:middle line:84%
Celebratory relationships
where; what Katie and I;

00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.631 align:middle line:84%
we don't really; we haven't
had an argument in so long

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:15.502 align:middle line:84%
that all our time goes
into doing creative things,

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:18.471 align:middle line:84%
doing nice things for each
other, doing things together.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:20.473 align:middle line:90%
And so we're always doing things

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
that celebrate the other
person and each other.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.645 align:middle line:84%
And like once a week
on the average,

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:28.248 align:middle line:84%
I ask Katie is there anything
I could be doing or saying

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.217 align:middle line:84%
that would make you feel
more loved or treasured?

00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:33.286 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big question
that we live in around here.

00:12:33.286 --> 00:12:39.426 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, what the ultimate
purpose of life on earth is,

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:43.997 align:middle line:84%
is to be in celebration with the
people you love and care about.

00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:46.032 align:middle line:84%
To really be in a
state of celebration

00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:50.437 align:middle line:84%
where you're surrounded by
people whose faces light

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:51.738 align:middle line:90%
up when you walk in the room.

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:54.507 align:middle line:84%
And your face lights up
when they walk in the room.

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:55.742 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:12:55.742 --> 00:12:58.111 align:middle line:84%
That's how life is supposed
to be lived in my view.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
But we're a long way
from that yet, you know.

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:02.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, most of us are

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:04.351 align:middle line:84%
in those lessons
relationship, right?

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:84%
Is there a moment where those
lesson relationships stop?

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Is it because we are ready

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.226 align:middle line:84%
for the sole soul
partnership to the next level?

00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:14.895 align:middle line:90%
Is that a personal commitment?

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that we
say no, I don't want any more

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.532 align:middle line:84%
of those challenging
relationships?

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:23.603 align:middle line:84%
Or is it because we love;
we're so much in love or love

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:26.172 align:middle line:84%
and respect ourselves that we're
ready for something bigger?

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.475 align:middle line:84%
How does; what is your
understanding of when does

00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.344 align:middle line:84%
that great, amazing
relationship shows up?

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:32.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: Yes.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, it shows up the
moment you become willing

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.621 align:middle line:84%
to love yourself
deeply for who you are.

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:48.295 align:middle line:84%
Faults, flaws, wonderful
aspects; the whole works.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:52.699 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens in
a learning relationship.

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:56.336 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you need
to learn and then you learn it

00:13:56.336 --> 00:14:01.041 align:middle line:84%
and then your love for
yourself expands and your love

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.109 align:middle line:90%
for the other person expands.

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.912 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a matter of
how long does it take.

00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:08.949 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of how long
does it take you to learn

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:12.319 align:middle line:84%
to love those things that
you're carrying within you.

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:15.388 align:middle line:84%
And as you open your heart
to those things in yourself,

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that might take you 10
minutes or 10 years;

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.925 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter, you know?

00:14:18.925 --> 00:14:21.928 align:middle line:84%
It really, truly doesn't;
isn't a matter of time.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:26.866 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of what you do
inside and how you be inside.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.636 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had couples here
that moved from learning

00:14:29.636 --> 00:14:32.539 align:middle line:84%
to a celebratory
relationship in 1 session.

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:35.675 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly saw exactly
what the pattern was

00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:38.745 align:middle line:84%
and they moved beyond
it and you know?

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've had couples be here
for 6 months sometimes and kind

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.051 align:middle line:90%
of [groaning noise], you know?

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:47.354 align:middle line:84%
But that's why we
have seminars too.

00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:51.324 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can get in a 3 day
seminar, if a couple comes

00:14:51.324 --> 00:14:54.094 align:middle line:84%
to one of our 3 day seminars,
they can do the equivalent

00:14:54.094 --> 00:15:00.033 align:middle line:84%
of 6 months of therapy because
in the seminar situation,

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:04.137 align:middle line:84%
the energy is heightened
because you have maybe 50 or 60

00:15:04.137 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
or 100 people in the room
who all are interested

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.975 align:middle line:90%
in learning the same thing.

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:11.745 align:middle line:84%
And so it kind of [whistling
noise] builds up the energy.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, what's
interesting here is

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.715 align:middle line:84%
that you speak of couples
that are already both in line

00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:18.418 align:middle line:84%
and both committed
to make it work,

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:21.254 align:middle line:84%
or at least to have
this open mindness to go

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
through the process
that it will take.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.659 align:middle line:84%
But not in every relationship,
both are kind of kind

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:31.231 align:middle line:84%
of on the same spiritual path or
spiritually awakened or willing.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:32.632 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well, that's
a very good point.

00:15:32.632 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
almost always,

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:38.872 align:middle line:84%
there will be a difference
between who really wants

00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:41.474 align:middle line:84%
to be there and who
really wants to work on it.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But that's just;
that's the way it works.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.914 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, a
study came out a while back

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:51.851 align:middle line:84%
that when a person
calls a therapist

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:58.625 align:middle line:84%
or a relationship coach to
ask for an appointment, males,

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
if it's a male-female
relationship;

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.165 align:middle line:84%
males make that call
4 percent of the time.

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:07.801 align:middle line:84%
And women make that call
96 percent of the time.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.537 align:middle line:84%
So that gives us a
clue that we men need

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to get a little bit more
committed to thinking

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:19.446 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves as participants
in relationships, not just;

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:22.115 align:middle line:84%
you know like, my
granddad; he was married

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:25.652 align:middle line:84%
to my grandmother
for 63 years I guess.

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:29.656 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think in that entire
time, he ever cooked a meal.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.692 align:middle line:84%
You know, my grandmother
cooked every single meal.

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:36.729 align:middle line:84%
When she died, he
basically would sit there

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:40.233 align:middle line:84%
at the table waiting
for somebody

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:43.803 align:middle line:84%
to put something there,
you know [laughing]?

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:45.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: [inaudible] [laughs]

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:48.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Fortunately, he had
a couple of dutiful daughters

00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:52.812 align:middle line:84%
that you know; but it was
a different era you know,

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
when male, female and
relationship roles were

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:59.252 align:middle line:90%
so different than they are now.

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:02.956 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I just attended a
lesbian wedding last Sunday.

00:17:02.956 --> 00:17:06.893 align:middle line:84%
And we were marveling
afterwards, you know,

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:08.727 align:middle line:90%
at how things have changed,

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.429 align:middle line:84%
because it's not our
first lesbian wedding.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.233 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Katie was the
officiant at this wedding

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:16.235 align:middle line:84%
and we've married
a number of people

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:20.106 align:middle line:84%
and officiated their wedding,
including some same sex couples.

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.474 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a time

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:26.212 align:middle line:84%
that relationships are very
different than when I grew up.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:30.583 align:middle line:84%
I mean on my block for example,
there were no gay couples, okay?

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.386 align:middle line:84%
You know, in a little
town in Florida.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:36.923 align:middle line:84%
On my block, there weren't
even any divorced people.

00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:41.027 align:middle line:84%
My father had died which was why
I was in a single parent family.

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:44.264 align:middle line:84%
But I was the only single
parent family on the block.

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else was in; and how
many blocks could you find today

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.869 align:middle line:84%
where that would be
true on, you know?

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:53.173 align:middle line:84%
That; because of the
divorce rate being so high.

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:57.744 align:middle line:84%
So everything has changed and
when everything is changed,

00:17:57.744 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
it behooves us to go back
to the basics and find

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:84%
out what really makes
relationships work.

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:06.252 align:middle line:84%
What makes them work time
after time after time

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle line:84%
in the business world and at
home is authenticity, honest,

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:12.759 align:middle line:90%
taking responsibility.

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:15.995 align:middle line:84%
Really taking, choosing
responsibility instead of blame,

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.734 align:middle line:84%
A third thing is learning how
to make and keep agreements.

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You cannot believe the
amount of messes in families

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.976 align:middle line:84%
that are caused by somebody not
doing what they said they were

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:31.311 align:middle line:90%
going to do.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:33.813 align:middle line:84%
You know, not picking up the
person from soccer practice

00:18:33.813 --> 00:18:36.683 align:middle line:84%
on time or not showing up
here or not remembering

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:38.484 align:middle line:84%
to buy the groceries,
or you know;

00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:44.357 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of broken agreements
eat up in my; by my rough count,

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:47.827 align:middle line:84%
roughly 50 to 60 percent
of the creative energy

00:18:47.827 --> 00:18:52.765 align:middle line:84%
in relationships is
kind of recovering

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:57.070 align:middle line:84%
from those kind of
broken agreements.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.472 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So then
when those are broken,

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:03.409 align:middle line:84%
it's about having a
conversation, recreating it?

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:05.378 align:middle line:84%
How about if it's always
the same person doing it?

00:19:05.378 --> 00:19:08.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well, you know, at
some point you have to have

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:12.051 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes unpleasant
10 minute conversation

00:19:12.051 --> 00:19:14.621 align:middle line:84%
that confronts the
person with that.

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that's
not easy to do, but you know,

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.628 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it because you
cannot allow broken agreements

00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:25.198 align:middle line:84%
to continue in a relationship
without being confronted.

00:19:25.198 --> 00:19:28.334 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the person
begins to think

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:30.937 align:middle line:84%
that their actions
have no consequences.

00:19:30.937 --> 00:19:33.373 align:middle line:84%
And people who think their
actions have no consequences

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:35.708 align:middle line:90%
become monsters in the world.

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:41.547 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need to be very
careful about allowing people

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to keep breaking agreements
because it's not good for them

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.653 align:middle line:84%
and it's not good for
us or the community.

00:19:46.653 --> 00:19:51.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You spoke earlier of
unfaithfulness and infidelity.

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:55.962 align:middle line:84%
How; what would you advise
to people in regards to that?

00:19:55.962 --> 00:19:59.732 align:middle line:84%
People that are facing that
or are suspicious of that

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.235 align:middle line:84%
or might have even
a fear of that?

00:20:02.235 --> 00:20:06.272 align:middle line:84%
It's very time consuming, it's
very; it takes a lot of energy

00:20:06.272 --> 00:20:09.075 align:middle line:90%
as you said, and worries.

00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:14.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: It absolutely does
and I would say first of all,

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:19.385 align:middle line:84%
that underneath almost every
relationship problem is some

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:20.987 align:middle line:90%
kind of fear.

00:20:20.987 --> 00:20:23.222 align:middle line:90%
And so to share that fear

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.726 align:middle line:84%
with the other person is an
incredibly important thing.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.295 align:middle line:84%
And how does the
other person respond

00:20:29.295 --> 00:20:32.332 align:middle line:84%
when you share your honest
feelings with the other person?

00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Does the other person
get defensive?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.035 align:middle line:90%
Well, that tells you that yes,

00:20:36.035 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
perhaps they are having
an affair, you know,

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:84%
if they get defensive in
the face of spoken truth,

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:45.511 align:middle line:84%
it could be that there is
something going on there.

00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:48.114 align:middle line:90%
We have an e-book that we put

00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:50.717 align:middle line:84%
out called The Relationship
Survival Guide and one

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:53.986 align:middle line:84%
of the sections in it is how
to tell if your mate is lying

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:58.958 align:middle line:84%
or not because it's
not that easy to spot.

00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:02.729 align:middle line:84%
But once you learn how to,
for what you're looking for,

00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:04.397 align:middle line:90%
it's not that hard either.

00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:08.701 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
is that the act of lying

00:21:08.701 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
or being inauthentic causes the
relationship to begin to wobble

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.944 align:middle line:84%
and intimacy to lessen and then
what people do is often begin

00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.513 align:middle line:84%
to blame that wobble
on the other person.

00:21:20.513 --> 00:21:23.249 align:middle line:84%
So they don't realize it's
their lack of authenticity

00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:25.752 align:middle line:84%
that started the wobble
in the first place.

00:21:25.752 --> 00:21:28.187 align:middle line:84%
Because once things begin
to wobble, you begin to say

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:30.223 align:middle line:84%
who is causing this
to wobble around here?

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:32.892 align:middle line:84%
[Laughs]. And usually
you blame out here.

00:21:32.892 --> 00:21:34.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:21:34.093 --> 00:21:37.296 align:middle line:84%
So [inaudible] on
ourselves, what is; what are;

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:41.868 align:middle line:84%
is there some [inaudible]
or patterns or way of beings

00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:45.338 align:middle line:84%
or just to be really; because
yeah, when we stay in our power,

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:48.674 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how it
can shift things.

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: One thing to get started
with is to make some statement

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.018 align:middle line:84%
or affirmations that are
the kind of affirmations

00:21:59.018 --> 00:22:01.621 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to actually
experience intimacy.

00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:04.657 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say
this is the affirmation;

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:11.798 align:middle line:84%
I commit to being
completely visible inside.

00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:15.902 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I commit
to complete transparency.

00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:18.571 align:middle line:84%
That's a big commitment
in relationship because;

00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:20.907 align:middle line:84%
and I have people make
that in this very room.

00:22:20.907 --> 00:22:23.009 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I'll have
a person who has cheated.

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:26.179 align:middle line:84%
I'll have them stand face
to face and I'll say okay,

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.513 align:middle line:90%
let's forget the past.

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:31.784 align:middle line:84%
Now right this moment, can
you honestly say this sentence

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:33.753 align:middle line:84%
to your partner,
the sentence being,

00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:38.524 align:middle line:84%
I commit to being fully
transparent with you, okay?

00:22:38.524 --> 00:22:39.826 align:middle line:90%
And I will work with them.

00:22:39.826 --> 00:22:42.895 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll have
them say that 500 times

00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:44.997 align:middle line:90%
until it's believable.

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:49.902 align:middle line:84%
And because you see, think
of that as an affirmation.

00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:51.904 align:middle line:84%
You might have to
say that 500 times

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:55.942 align:middle line:84%
to yourself before it becomes
true for you, you know,

00:22:55.942 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:84%
because if you believe
since childhood,

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.617 align:middle line:84%
that authenticity will
get you in trouble,

00:23:04.617 --> 00:23:09.455 align:middle line:84%
or authenticity will; is the way
you're supposed to do things;

00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:12.158 align:middle line:84%
if you have been taught
the opposite to that

00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:15.761 align:middle line:84%
since you were a kid, it's hard
to break up those old patterns.

00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:17.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And most of us
believe that we're not loveable

00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:18.965 align:middle line:90%
for just the way we are.

00:23:18.965 --> 00:23:19.765 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: Exactly.

00:23:19.765 --> 00:23:21.033 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:25.771 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I think
once you make a commitment

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:28.608 align:middle line:84%
to something like being
authentic or make a commitment

00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to eliminating blame
and criticism,

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.579 align:middle line:84%
give yourself some time
to make good on that.

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:37.183 align:middle line:84%
Don't start criticizing yourself
because you want to kind

00:23:37.183 --> 00:23:41.487 align:middle line:84%
of reward yourself for
the times you show up,

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:43.523 align:middle line:90%
not being inauthentic.

00:23:43.523 --> 00:23:45.191 align:middle line:84%
You know, you want
to reward yourself,

00:23:45.191 --> 00:23:48.127 align:middle line:84%
celebrate when you do
show up being honest.

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:52.165 align:middle line:84%
And that way you begin to
build a whole new life based

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:55.535 align:middle line:84%
on genuine trust in
the relationship.

00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:59.005 align:middle line:84%
People really being able
to show up reliably over

00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:00.239 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:02.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah and when you
feel it's time to leave,

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:05.878 align:middle line:84%
is there a particular; because
I guess sometimes it's staying

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:07.013 align:middle line:90%
there for those lessons

00:24:07.013 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's also
leaving a relationship.

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:11.217 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
reasons, the good reasons,

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:12.685 align:middle line:90%
to leave a relationship?

00:24:12.685 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well you know, that's a
very good question because one

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.821 align:middle line:90%
of the things I've noticed here

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.924 align:middle line:84%
in my office actually
it's happened;

00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a couple here and
they will have learned a number

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:28.834 align:middle line:84%
of things with each other and
then one day they realize, hmm,

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.904 align:middle line:84%
I don't actually want to be
in this relationship anymore.

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:34.307 align:middle line:84%
So both of them consciously
make a decision

00:24:34.307 --> 00:24:38.444 align:middle line:84%
to go their separate ways but
it's not as a result of a drama

00:24:38.444 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
or a fight or anything
like that.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.117 align:middle line:84%
Or a betrayal; it's
just they say okay,

00:24:45.117 --> 00:24:46.786 align:middle line:84%
we've learned what
we need to learn.

00:24:46.786 --> 00:24:49.188 align:middle line:84%
And that has happened
so many times.

00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:51.157 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a
good conscious way

00:24:51.157 --> 00:24:52.425 align:middle line:90%
to leave relationships.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.961 align:middle line:84%
But what blocks that
you see is a lot

00:24:54.961 --> 00:24:59.365 align:middle line:84%
of people leave a relationship
blaming the other person

00:24:59.365 --> 00:25:03.836 align:middle line:84%
and then they don't get to
go hmm, what was it about me

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:05.805 align:middle line:90%
that caused that problem?

00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:09.542 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't care whether
the other person looks

00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:11.844 align:middle line:84%
like the total perpetrator
of this.

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:16.549 align:middle line:84%
There's always 2 people
at play in a relationship.

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:20.353 align:middle line:84%
And the person who makes this
move first gets free fast.

00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:25.358 align:middle line:84%
If you make this move and say
hmm, what did I do to contribute

00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to having that relationship
go wrong?

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.929 align:middle line:84%
You'll get a lot more
mileage out of that than

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:32.898 align:middle line:84%
if you say what is that person;
why did they do that to me?

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:35.167 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen
people do that for years.

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:36.869 align:middle line:84%
You know, why did
they do that to me?

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:39.639 align:middle line:90%
Whereas hmm, what [inaudible].

00:25:39.639 --> 00:25:41.941 align:middle line:90%
I wonder, hmmm.

00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:45.845 align:middle line:84%
That's the voice of liberation
speaking through you there.

00:25:45.845 --> 00:25:48.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Ten, also the
wonderful character in your,

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:51.717 align:middle line:84%
in your novel had those
relationship or has those.

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:54.020 align:middle line:90%
What kind of relationship issues

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.056 align:middle line:84%
or insights does he
have in this way?

00:25:57.056 --> 00:25:59.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well Ten is
now in his thirties

00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:03.562 align:middle line:84%
and so he's just finished making
all the relationship mistakes

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.031 align:middle line:90%
that I made in my twenties.

00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:10.369 align:middle line:84%
So I put all of them in here
and then he's my; he's the best

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:13.673 align:middle line:84%
of me and the worst of me
in the relationship area.

00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:14.874 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry, he's learning.

00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:17.443 align:middle line:84%
He's going through these
learning relationships

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:20.946 align:middle line:84%
but eventually he's going to get
to a celebratory relationship.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:23.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So what
are some of them?

00:26:23.616 --> 00:26:25.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: What are the learnings?

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:30.456 align:middle line:84%
Well for him, he had to break up
fights between his parents a lot

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:34.527 align:middle line:84%
when he was a kid , so he
was kind of the peacemaker.

00:26:34.527 --> 00:26:38.264 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with being a
peacemaker is you don't allow

00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:41.600 align:middle line:84%
yourself to feel your
own feelings you know,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.371 align:middle line:84%
because you're focused on
fixing everybody else out there,

00:26:45.371 --> 00:26:48.274 align:middle line:84%
that you lose touch with
your own feelings in here.

00:26:48.274 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was his problem in
a lot of his relationships.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.446 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know exactly who
he was or what he wanted

00:26:53.446 --> 00:26:56.682 align:middle line:84%
or he would just kind of be
pulled around from one thing

00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:58.551 align:middle line:84%
to the other because he
didn't know what he wanted

00:26:58.551 --> 00:27:00.386 align:middle line:84%
and he's just learning
what he really wants.

00:27:00.386 --> 00:27:03.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you
[inaudible] this character?

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:07.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Oh yes, he's a soul
brother of mine and I love

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:09.195 align:middle line:84%
to spend time with him
every day and also,

00:27:09.195 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
he's got some great
girlfriends in these books too

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.432 align:middle line:84%
so I have a lot of
vicarious pleasure there.

00:27:13.432 --> 00:27:15.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do
you [inaudible];

00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:24.443 align:middle line:90%
[ Inaudible ]

00:27:35.888 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well, I'm a big
believer in monogamy.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.961 align:middle line:84%
I've never found anything
else that worked, really.

00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:45.931 align:middle line:84%
I tried, believe me, back
in my twenties [laughing]

00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:51.337 align:middle line:84%
but I did plenty of experiments
but I found in my thirties

00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:55.141 align:middle line:84%
that unless I really made
a commitment to one person,

00:27:55.141 --> 00:28:00.179 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really get to the
deepest layer of stuff that was

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:05.117 align:middle line:84%
in my way of really being able
to love and live to the maximum.

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:08.487 align:middle line:84%
And so at a certain point;
I guess I was about 34

00:28:08.487 --> 00:28:09.855 align:middle line:90%
when I had this realization.

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:13.926 align:middle line:84%
I made a commitment to Katie
and you know the commitment was

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:18.664 align:middle line:84%
to love and live and flourish
to the best of our ability

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:20.499 align:middle line:90%
in a monogamous relationship.

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we ever felt the
urge to do anything else,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.437 align:middle line:90%
that we made an agreement

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:27.106 align:middle line:84%
that we would be the
first people we talk

00:28:27.106 --> 00:28:28.808 align:middle line:90%
to about it, you know?

00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:33.078 align:middle line:84%
So if she got the urge to have
a relationship with somebody,

00:28:33.078 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:90%
she was committed to telling me

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.715 align:middle line:84%
about it before she told
anybody else about it.

00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.585 align:middle line:84%
Or telling me about it before
she did anything about it.

00:28:39.585 --> 00:28:44.323 align:middle line:84%
And so we had that agreement but
we never had to really use it

00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:47.660 align:middle line:90%
but one time, back around 1995,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.695 align:middle line:84%
when I got attracted
to another woman.

00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:52.998 align:middle line:84%
And so I kind of had to have
that exotic experience of coming

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:55.467 align:middle line:84%
to Katie and saying hey Katie,
it happened finally, you know.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.269 align:middle line:84%
I feel attracted
to the other woman.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:59.405 align:middle line:84%
As it happened, just talking
to her about it and everything,

00:28:59.405 --> 00:29:03.309 align:middle line:84%
it didn't emerge as a sexual
affair or anything, but I;

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:08.247 align:middle line:84%
so we were able to preserve
our monogamous relationship.

00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:14.587 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, yeah, yeah.

00:29:14.587 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a; you know,
here's something funny.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.792 align:middle line:90%
Truth has a bad reputation.

00:29:19.792 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They always say you know, don't
tell your partner such and such

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.299 align:middle line:84%
because then it will break the
trust up in the relationship.

00:29:27.299 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I say the other thing.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.935 align:middle line:84%
I say if there's anything
that you haven't talked

00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:32.438 align:middle line:84%
to your partner about
that's significant,

00:29:32.438 --> 00:29:34.073 align:middle line:90%
you don't have a relationship.

00:29:34.073 --> 00:29:35.641 align:middle line:90%
You have an entanglement.

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:39.945 align:middle line:84%
A relationship is
only between 2 equals.

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.415 align:middle line:84%
An entanglement is one person
folded in on the other person

00:29:43.415 --> 00:29:46.285 align:middle line:84%
so that the movement
of both is encumbered.

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:47.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Right.

00:29:47.553 --> 00:29:50.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: And so to have a
relationship, you honestly need

00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:53.359 align:middle line:84%
to have both people being
authentic with each other,

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:56.528 align:middle line:84%
otherwise you don't
really have a relationship.

00:29:56.528 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What is it then;

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.233 align:middle line:84%
is it something that's
worth living then?

00:30:01.233 --> 00:30:02.601 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying:

00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Yeah, it becomes an
entanglement, and it actually;

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.873 align:middle line:84%
the thing about an entanglement
is it drains your energy

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:10.542 align:middle line:90%
and so unless you're opening up

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:12.211 align:middle line:84%
and really becoming
more authentic

00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
in your close relationships,
you're actually shutting down

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.982 align:middle line:84%
and that's draining
energy all the time.

00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.785 align:middle line:84%
Is there some other things that
are really important to keep

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:22.354 align:middle line:84%
in mind in relationships
that you would love to share

00:30:22.354 --> 00:30:25.291 align:middle line:90%
with us today for Gaiam?

00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:28.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: One big one
is that many times

00:30:28.861 --> 00:30:32.598 align:middle line:84%
when people have relationships
that are breaking up,

00:30:32.598 --> 00:30:35.267 align:middle line:84%
we ask them what is the
reason you're breaking up?

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:36.835 align:middle line:90%
What is the one thing?

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:42.341 align:middle line:84%
And so many people say I
didn't feel appreciated.

00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel appreciated.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.812 align:middle line:90%
He never said I appreciate you

00:30:46.812 --> 00:30:49.114 align:middle line:84%
or she never said
I appreciate you.

00:30:49.114 --> 00:30:51.617 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, there's a
dozen different ways to say;

00:30:51.617 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't always
have to just say it,

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.788 align:middle line:90%
but it's an appreciative touch

00:30:55.788 --> 00:30:57.523 align:middle line:84%
or it's doing something
for another person.

00:30:57.523 --> 00:31:02.494 align:middle line:84%
But it's that you're thinking
of the other person and acting

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:06.999 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is designed to
bring out more of their essence,

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
bring out more of their
natural organic good feeling.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.774 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us go into
relationships as a get thing.

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:19.545 align:middle line:84%
We want to get love
or get something.

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:22.081 align:middle line:84%
But relationship
really is a flow.

00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:25.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a flow of giving and
getting all at the same time.

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.488 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of it as just
a get thing, boy, that's very;

00:31:29.488 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
it impoverishes you
very quickly.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:34.927 align:middle line:84%
It's only when it's part of a
flow and particularly a flow

00:31:34.927 --> 00:31:38.964 align:middle line:84%
of equality in a relationship,
that really makes things hum.

00:31:38.964 --> 00:31:42.468 align:middle line:84%
Where both people are really
fulfilling their own creative

00:31:42.468 --> 00:31:44.737 align:middle line:84%
desires at the same
time of being

00:31:44.737 --> 00:31:46.672 align:middle line:90%
in relationship with each other.

00:31:46.672 --> 00:31:52.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How deep can the love
be and what is it related to?

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:56.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Well ultimately, love is
related to the creative source

00:31:56.582 --> 00:31:58.951 align:middle line:84%
of the universe because
if you think about it,

00:31:58.951 --> 00:32:00.586 align:middle line:90%
where did love come from?

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:03.522 align:middle line:84%
It comes out of the
creative source of ourselves.

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:04.723 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:32:04.723 --> 00:32:07.259 align:middle line:84%
We come from the creative
source of the universe.

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:11.096 align:middle line:84%
And it's an amazing power
because the healing power

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:13.966 align:middle line:84%
of love is such that;
and I've seen it

00:32:13.966 --> 00:32:17.669 align:middle line:90%
in here a bunch of times; love;

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:26.745 align:middle line:90%
[ Inaudible ]

00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:37.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: Counter with that part

00:32:37.589 --> 00:32:40.626 align:middle line:84%
of themselves that's driving
the illness, you know?

00:32:40.626 --> 00:32:44.263 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's their fear or maybe
it's their old resentment

00:32:44.263 --> 00:32:49.034 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's some old rage
they inherited from long ago.

00:32:49.034 --> 00:32:52.604 align:middle line:84%
But whatever is driving the
illness, once they come to have

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.474 align:middle line:90%
that moment of love with it,

00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:58.343 align:middle line:84%
then things begin
to shift and change.

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:03.148 align:middle line:84%
I at one time weighed 320 pounds
and wore big, thick glasses

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:06.518 align:middle line:84%
and smoked 3 packs of
Marlborough's a day.

00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:10.255 align:middle line:84%
And yet now here I am
140 pounds lighter.

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:13.392 align:middle line:84%
I haven't smoked a cigarette in
God knows how long; 40 years.

00:33:13.392 --> 00:33:16.929 align:middle line:84%
And I you know, heal
my vision that way

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:20.099 align:middle line:84%
and so I've become a total
cheerleader for the power

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:25.037 align:middle line:84%
of love not just in relationship
work but just in feeling good

00:33:25.037 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:84%
in health and you
know, creativity.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:32.244 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like the more we
live in the question of hmm,

00:33:32.244 --> 00:33:34.246 align:middle line:84%
what is it here that
needs to be loved?

00:33:34.246 --> 00:33:37.015 align:middle line:90%
Hmmm. Hmmm.

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:39.618 align:middle line:84%
How can I do to create
more love in my life?

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:42.421 align:middle line:84%
Hmmm. You know, those
big questions like that.

00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:45.491 align:middle line:84%
When we can kind of live
in those kind of questions,

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:49.394 align:middle line:84%
life falls all over itself
rewarding us for that.

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:53.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Inaudible] or into
this self-love then the deeper

00:33:53.499 --> 00:33:56.068 align:middle line:84%
our other external
relay [inaudible];

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: Yes and may
I read you a quote?

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.977 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
quotes from a gentleman

00:34:04.977 --> 00:34:06.578 align:middle line:84%
that you would never
expect to say this;

00:34:06.578 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Franz Kafka who is a Czech
writer of many years ago.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:12.885 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] get a book.

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:15.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: One of my
[inaudible] books.

00:34:30.936 --> 00:34:33.604 align:middle line:84%
You do not need to
leave your room.

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:36.542 align:middle line:84%
Remain sitting at
your table and listen.

00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:39.644 align:middle line:90%
Do not even listen, simply wait.

00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:43.314 align:middle line:84%
Do not even wait, be
quite still and ordinary.

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:46.818 align:middle line:84%
The world will freely offer
itself to be unmasked.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.253 align:middle line:90%
It has no choice.

00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:53.859 align:middle line:84%
It will roll in ecstasy
at your feet.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible].

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.063 align:middle line:84%
Is that amazing that if you just
open up that space of beingness,

00:34:58.063 --> 00:35:02.968 align:middle line:84%
suddenly life is ready to
just reward you with it.

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:07.573 align:middle line:84%
And what keeps us from doing
that is that kind of you know,

00:35:07.573 --> 00:35:09.741 align:middle line:84%
out in front of the
moment striving

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:13.579 align:middle line:84%
or behind the moment
apathy and slackness.

00:35:13.579 --> 00:35:17.349 align:middle line:84%
But in this moment, with
a real commitment to love,

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.484 align:middle line:90%
with a real commitment to life,

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.854 align:middle line:84%
life itself becomes one magical
experience after another.

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: [Inaudible].

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:26.225 align:middle line:90%
We let it emerge.

00:35:26.225 --> 00:35:27.492 align:middle line:90%
We let it manifest.

00:35:27.492 --> 00:35:29.094 align:middle line:90%
We let it be.

00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:30.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Gay: That's what
I'm learning.

00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:33.498 align:middle line:84%
And the more I do that,
the better it gets.

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:35.901 align:middle line:84%
And that's been going that
way for the last 30 years

00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:39.037 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully for the next 30,
it will keep going that way.

00:35:39.037 --> 00:35:39.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:35:39.838 --> 00:35:41.206 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe in miracles?

00:35:41.206 --> 00:35:42.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: I am a miracle.

00:35:42.407 --> 00:35:44.977 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a miracle this
moment, yes [laughs].

00:35:44.977 --> 00:35:47.279 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
them, I practice them.

00:35:47.279 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:90%
I live them.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:35:50.182 --> 00:35:52.317 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you so much for the
delicious; I love the twinkle

00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:53.785 align:middle line:90%
in your eyes by the way.

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:58.357 align:middle line:84%
They have this thing
that is magnificent.

00:35:58.357 --> 00:36:06.265 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] share that with you
because I've got the pleasure

00:36:06.265 --> 00:36:08.533 align:middle line:84%
to see Gay's eyes right
there so thank you

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:11.637 align:middle line:84%
so for all the teachings
on relationship.

00:36:11.637 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:84%
If we can summarize right
now to finish this interview,

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:84%
with 3 main points maybe,
on relationship for people,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.612 align:middle line:90%
to end this beautiful interview?

00:36:20.612 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Gay: Own your feelings.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.048 align:middle line:90%
Tell the truth.

00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Keep to your agreements
and appreciate.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.953 align:middle line:90%
Feel all your feelings.

00:36:27.953 --> 00:36:31.657 align:middle line:84%
Tell the truth, even
if it's hard sometimes.

00:36:31.657 --> 00:36:36.428 align:middle line:84%
Keep your agreements and above
all, remember to keep the flow

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:38.697 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation going
with the other person.

00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:40.899 align:middle line:84%
So right now for
example, if I was going

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:43.302 align:middle line:84%
to improve my relationship
with Lilou, Id' say something

00:36:43.302 --> 00:36:46.505 align:middle line:84%
like wow, I really
enjoyed this relationship.

00:36:46.505 --> 00:36:47.940 align:middle line:90%
You asked great questions.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.741 align:middle line:90%
You're fun to talk to.

00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:52.511 align:middle line:90%
And you arrive on time.

00:36:52.511 --> 00:36:55.013 align:middle line:90%
And you don't mess up my house

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:59.651 align:middle line:84%
and you bring a small crew
here unlike the people from CBS

00:36:59.651 --> 00:37:02.354 align:middle line:84%
that brought 17 people
here and muddied

00:37:02.354 --> 00:37:03.689 align:middle line:90%
up my rug and everything.

00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:05.057 align:middle line:90%
So blessings to you.
