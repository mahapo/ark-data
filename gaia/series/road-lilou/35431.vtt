[ Music ]

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:13.114 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here, I'm on the road.

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:15.116 align:middle line:90%
And today I'm in San Diego

00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:17.318 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
big meeting happening

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
with a transformational
leadership council.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.358 align:middle line:84%
And I just TLC and there's so
many beautiful awesome leaders,

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.694 align:middle line:84%
New York Times best
sellers that are here.

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.597 align:middle line:84%
And I had to cover a
few interviews here

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:34.268 align:middle line:84%
for Gaiam specifically because
I know that your, that you want

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.103 align:middle line:90%
to live the juiciest life ever.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.973 align:middle line:84%
And, and here we're going to
speak about the love attraction

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.574 align:middle line:90%
and how to attract our soulmates

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.378 align:middle line:84%
and really just have this
beautiful amazing life all the

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.413 align:middle line:84%
way and even in the
relationship area.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.548 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one, huh?

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Ford: Yeah,
everybody wants love.

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:52.586 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to know the
story of why we want love?

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:58.425 align:middle line:84%
So a long time ago during the
time of Socrates and those guys

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:02.029 align:middle line:84%
in Greece there were these
beings that lived on the planet.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle line:84%
They were big rolley polley
beings and they had four arms

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.034 align:middle line:84%
and they had four legs and
they had two sets of genitalia.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:11.672 align:middle line:84%
And they just rolled all over
the earth laughing and playing,

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.674 align:middle line:90%
giggling and having fun.

00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And Zeus who was up
in the heavens felt

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.646 align:middle line:84%
like these beings
weren't honoring the Gods

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:19.647 align:middle line:90%
and the Goddesses enough.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.649 align:middle line:90%
And he was very angry with them.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.985 align:middle line:84%
So he took out his sword
and he sliced them in half

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:27.655 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they were
beings that only had two arms

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.357 align:middle line:84%
and two legs and one
set of genitalia.

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:33.994 align:middle line:84%
And since that time we've been
searching the planet looking

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:90%
for our other half.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.998 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we seek love and
we desire to have a soulmate

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:42.403 align:middle line:84%
and we so want to
reconnect with the right one.

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Why did you decide to
write this book on soulmates?

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:48.576 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this is a, I mean
you devoted your life to it now.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:51.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Ford: Yeah well I
actually never thought a book

00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:53.214 align:middle line:84%
called The Soulmate Secret
but what happened was

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:57.117 align:middle line:84%
when I was 43 years old I woke
up one morning and I thought

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.754 align:middle line:84%
to myself, oh my God I
forgot to get married.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.324 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking
about my life and I saw

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:06.594 align:middle line:84%
that I had created this
amazing business and career.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:84%
And when I'd looked
at how I had done it,

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.598 align:middle line:84%
I had used the law
of attraction.

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.433 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day when I
learned it it wasn't called

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.201 align:middle line:84%
that it was just
called manifestation.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.437 align:middle line:84%
So I had all these prayers
and rituals and processes

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:21.609 align:middle line:84%
that I used to make stuff happen
to co-create with the universe.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.679 align:middle line:84%
And I started wondering well,
if it worked so well in my life,

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.281 align:middle line:90%
would it work in my love life?

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:29.149 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.785 align:middle line:84%
So I made a list of
everything that I knew how to do

00:02:31.785 --> 00:02:33.554 align:middle line:90%
and I started doing the list

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:37.124 align:middle line:84%
and within 6 months I
manifested the most amazing guy

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:38.392 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:41.762 align:middle line:84%
I mean, loving, kind, generous,
sexy, hot, devoted, fun,

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.631 align:middle line:90%
spiritual, everything.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:46.066 align:middle line:84%
And we had this very
magical meeting.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.602 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after we
met we got engaged.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:84%
And a year later we
had three weddings.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And we just celebrated
out 15th anniversary.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do you
mean three weddings?

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:55.843 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: We had three weddings.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So the first wedding
was performed by Amma,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.148 align:middle line:90%
the hugging saint from India.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.351 align:middle line:84%
Now it was a Hindu ceremony
but it wasn't legal.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.886 align:middle line:84%
So then we wanted to
have a legal wedding.

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I was doing
publicity for Kenny Loggins.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.725 align:middle line:84%
So he agreed to be
ordained as a minister.

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:14.995 align:middle line:84%
So he was both our officiant
and our wedding singer.

00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:17.498 align:middle line:84%
So we had this great big amazing
wedding in Santa Barbara.

00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:20.267 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a third
wedding with another client

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.569 align:middle line:90%
of mine who was a wicken.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.706 align:middle line:84%
And we did a pagan hand
fasting on top of a mountain.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.876 align:middle line:84%
So we literally had
three weddings.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:31.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So can we say that
meeting your soulmate is kind

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.881 align:middle line:84%
of bringing the earth
and the heavens together

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and living this,
really this [inaudible]

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.386 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: It's heaven on
earth, yeah, absolutely.

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.689 align:middle line:84%
You know and so you're asking
me why I wrote the book.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.223 align:middle line:84%
Well I never intended
to write the book

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
but what happened was I guess
about six or seven years

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.197 align:middle line:84%
after we got married somebody
asked me to give a talk.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:54.101 align:middle line:84%
They said share with my 200
coaches how you manifested

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:90%
your soulmate.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:84%
So I stood up and I did
this 45 minute talk.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.607 align:middle line:84%
And then 200 people came at
me saying where's the book?

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:01.442 align:middle line:90%
Where's the book?

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I need to know how to do this.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.678 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
book came to be.

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:06.213 align:middle line:84%
There was just this
demand for it

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:08.982 align:middle line:84%
because every time I
would share my process,

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.417 align:middle line:90%
it would work for somebody.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:15.555 align:middle line:84%
This process works for men and
women, any age, any height,

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.358 align:middle line:90%
any weight, any income level.

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:21.028 align:middle line:84%
It even worked for my 80
year old mother-in-law.

00:04:21.028 --> 00:04:24.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And it even works not
only for relationship I guess

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:28.001 align:middle line:84%
but also to attract the
life that we truly desire.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.203 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Right.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.238 align:middle line:84%
Well the basic principles
involved you can apply

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.539 align:middle line:90%
to anything.

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.209 align:middle line:84%
I had started off using them
for my career in business

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.444 align:middle line:84%
and lifestyle and
moved them into love.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:40.414 align:middle line:84%
But you could start with love
and move them into other areas

00:04:40.414 --> 00:04:43.217 align:middle line:84%
because what I discovered
that really works best

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:46.086 align:middle line:90%
for me is first having clarity.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:47.988 align:middle line:90%
What is my heart calling for?

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
What I do I most desire?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.025 align:middle line:90%
What do I want it to look like?

00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:53.894 align:middle line:84%
So it could be you're just
looking for a new place to live,

00:04:53.894 --> 00:04:56.163 align:middle line:84%
you know, or it could be you're
looking for you true love

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:58.665 align:middle line:90%
or a new job or, you know,

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.168 align:middle line:84%
maybe even the perfect
little black dress.

00:05:01.168 --> 00:05:02.603 align:middle line:84%
You know, but you
have to have clarity.

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.571 align:middle line:90%
What is the desire?

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.408 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to go into
action with it, you know.

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:08.809 align:middle line:90%
Like what do I need to do next?

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.178 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
spend time feeling

00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:13.313 align:middle line:90%
or what I call a feelingization.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.649 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to feel
in that little black dress?

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.352 align:middle line:84%
Like you may not know what store
it's in, but how am I going

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:19.453 align:middle line:90%
to feel when I'm wearing it?

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:21.655 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll just
come to you, you know,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:90%
where you need to go shopping.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.461 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole bits and
pieces of processes to do

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.164 align:middle line:84%
to co-create with the
universe and make stuff happen.

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:31.932 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love when you
mention the dress because it's

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:35.569 align:middle line:84%
like as woman or
women doing the same,

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.604 align:middle line:84%
searching for the men the
same way they're searching

00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:38.439 align:middle line:90%
for the dress.

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:39.907 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work is it?

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:42.176 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Well actually
it does work.

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:44.445 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar the
way that it works, okay.

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's just talk
about it from, you know,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.283 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
perspective because people

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:51.718 align:middle line:84%
who don't have a soulmate
definitely desire one.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:52.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: So I would say
the first step you want

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.724 align:middle line:84%
to do is let's clear
out the past

00:05:57.724 --> 00:05:59.526 align:middle line:90%
and do some forgiveness work.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:00.961 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's forgive
ourselves

00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:02.429 align:middle line:90%
for all the mistakes we've made,

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:04.731 align:middle line:84%
all the bad choices
we made in the past.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:05.933 align:middle line:90%
And then let's forgive the ones

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:08.235 align:middle line:84%
who are saying have
done us wrong.

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.137 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's not
that hard to forgive.

00:06:10.137 --> 00:06:12.139 align:middle line:90%
You first have to be willing.

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.574 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's the first part.

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:16.944 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that you're
condoning anybody's behavior,

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:18.779 align:middle line:90%
you're not giving them a pass,

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.248 align:middle line:84%
but you're just saying you
know what, I forgive you,

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.983 align:middle line:90%
I bless you, I let you go.

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.485 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots
of ways to do that.

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:26.587 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
process we talked

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:28.589 align:middle line:90%
about is getting to clarity.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.257 align:middle line:84%
You know, how do
you want to feel

00:06:30.257 --> 00:06:31.525 align:middle line:90%
when you're with this person?

00:06:31.525 --> 00:06:35.395 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to loved,
cherished, adored, devoted to?

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:38.999 align:middle line:84%
And then what kind of qualities
would this kind of person have?

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle line:84%
Would they be loving, kind,
affectionate, generous?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's a different kind of wish
then then, he's got to be 6'2",

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.309 align:middle line:84%
180 pounds, you know,
work as an accountant,

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle line:90%
make X amount of dollars a year.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:54.448 align:middle line:84%
Not that you have to not
ask for those things,

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:57.784 align:middle line:84%
you can if they're really,
really, really important to you

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:02.022 align:middle line:84%
but it's more important
to create something

00:07:02.022 --> 00:07:04.157 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to feel the
way you most want to feel.

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:06.293 align:middle line:84%
So you see there's
a distinction there.

00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:09.463 align:middle line:84%
So when I was making
my soulmate wish list,

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:90%
I first looked to the past.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the long term
relationships I had in the past.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.702 align:middle line:84%
And the guys were
kind of similar.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:20.874 align:middle line:84%
They were super ambitious, type
A, captain of the universe,

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:90%
uber successful kind of guys.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.981 align:middle line:84%
Now those kind of guys don't
have the time or the energy

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:31.485 align:middle line:84%
to devote to a relationship
or to a particular woman.

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:34.655 align:middle line:84%
And so when I asked my
soul what do I most need

00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:36.023 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship?

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:39.626 align:middle line:84%
I needed somebody who's
really generous but generous

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:43.096 align:middle line:84%
with their time and their
affection and their attention.

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:47.301 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be someone who I
was their universe for them.

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.671 align:middle line:84%
I need, that's what, it was
embarrassing to admit at first

00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:54.241 align:middle line:84%
but I needed somebody who would
really pay attention to me.

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.244 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I put on my
list was generous with his time

00:07:57.244 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and energy and love
and affection.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.914 align:middle line:90%
You know, did I want somebody

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:03.417 align:middle line:84%
who was also really
brilliant and successful?

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.486 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but it wasn't the
first thing on the list.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.455 align:middle line:84%
The only physical
attribute I had

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:84%
on the list was I wanted
somebody with gray hair.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.595 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know why or excuse
me, where that was coming from.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:15.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:17.164 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: But gray hair
kept popping up.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:18.332 align:middle line:90%
So I put it on the list.

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah that's
one of those things.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.268 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't know if
it's coming from something

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:23.704 align:middle line:84%
that we know that we're going
to have or if it's, you know,

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:26.473 align:middle line:84%
our imagination or but it
kept on, yeah coming back.

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:27.874 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Whenever I
would think about being

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
with my soulmate I saw
somebody with gray hair.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.479 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed that meant he
would be much older than me.

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.183 align:middle line:84%
But the truth was Brian
went gray in his 30s.

00:08:36.183 --> 00:08:39.186 align:middle line:84%
So he did have salt and
pepper hair when we met.

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:41.588 align:middle line:84%
So creating this
list is a really,

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:43.523 align:middle line:84%
really important
piece of the puzzle.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.792 align:middle line:84%
And you want to ask
yourself with every trait

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:48.261 align:middle line:84%
that you write down,
will this contribute

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:49.529 align:middle line:90%
to my long term happiness.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.165 align:middle line:84%
And if the answer
is no not really,

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:90%
then take it off the list.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.435 align:middle line:90%
It's not important.

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.871 align:middle line:90%
So, I made this long list

00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.673 align:middle line:84%
and then I showed it
to my best friend.

00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:01.842 align:middle line:84%
And I said did I
leave anything off?

00:09:01.842 --> 00:09:04.745 align:middle line:84%
And she said yes, you left off
something really important.

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:05.946 align:middle line:90%
It's like what's that?

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:07.748 align:middle line:84%
She said he has to
be a cat lover

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:09.583 align:middle line:90%
because I have always had cats.

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.718 align:middle line:84%
And I had dated guys who
were allergic to cats

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:90%
and trust me it's not pretty.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.122 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
coughing, sneezing, choking,

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.224 align:middle line:84%
their eyes are running,
their nose is running.

00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:19.126 align:middle line:84%
You know, that would
have been a deal breaker.

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:22.663 align:middle line:84%
So you make this list and then
you have a trusted friend review

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:25.298 align:middle line:84%
it with you to make sure you
didn't leave off anything

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.767 align:middle line:90%
really important.

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.835 align:middle line:84%
I also had some silly
things on my list

00:09:28.835 --> 00:09:30.537 align:middle line:90%
or they weren't silly to me.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.907 align:middle line:84%
Like, I wanted somebody who
had English as a first language

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.176 align:middle line:84%
because I had dated
men from other,

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:37.978 align:middle line:90%
who spoke other languages.

00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
were fluent in English,

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.848 align:middle line:90%
the communication is different.

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:43.784 align:middle line:84%
We have different meanings
for different words.

00:09:43.784 --> 00:09:46.353 align:middle line:84%
And being that I'm all
about communication,

00:09:46.353 --> 00:09:49.089 align:middle line:84%
I knew that English as a
first language is important.

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:52.259 align:middle line:84%
I also somebody who
enjoyed walking and hiking

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:54.594 align:middle line:84%
because that's something I do
every day and I wanted somebody

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.962 align:middle line:90%
to walk and hike with.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.397 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
kinds of things.

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:59.366 align:middle line:84%
You want to have heart
traits and qualities.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:00.967 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to
have your lifestyle.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.403 align:middle line:84%
What do you want your life
together to look like?

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.439 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's important to
know, do you want children

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:07.307 align:middle line:90%
or don't you want children?

00:10:07.307 --> 00:10:10.077 align:middle line:84%
You know, I knew from an early
age I never wanted to have kids.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:12.346 align:middle line:84%
In fact the very first
day Brian and I met,

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.081 align:middle line:84%
I told him I didn't
want to have children.

00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:16.983 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe I
said it but I did say it.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:20.454 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make
this list and I'm going

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle line:84%
to tell you right now
what the first thing

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
on everybody's list should be

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.926 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
pretty much universal.

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:31.198 align:middle line:84%
You want somebody who is
open, willing and available

00:10:31.198 --> 00:10:35.335 align:middle line:84%
for a long term committed,
monogamous married

00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:38.305 align:middle line:84%
or relationship depending
on which one you want.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.673 align:middle line:90%
And the reason I say that is

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:84%
because you could do this
whole list but, you know,

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.411 align:middle line:90%
if they're already married

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:84%
to somebody else
they're not available.

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:48.715 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
have available on there.

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:52.753 align:middle line:84%
You know, or I know one woman
who made this whole list

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:56.156 align:middle line:84%
and the man that she
manifested was gay.

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.059 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't change that
even though he met the list

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:84%
and they got, they were
great friends, you know,

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.696 align:middle line:90%
she fell in love with him.

00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.832 align:middle line:84%
So I would say open,
willing, available, straight

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
or gay depending
on what you want

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.437 align:middle line:84%
for a long term committed
monogamous relationship

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
with kids if you want kids
or leave it off if you don't.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.709 align:middle line:84%
But that's like number
one on the list.

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah and for the
releasing part you advise

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:22.349 align:middle line:84%
to just write that on the letter
and then burn it and release it?

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the process?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.519 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: So once you
have your list

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.721 align:middle line:84%
and it's complete then
you should write it

00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:31.458 align:middle line:84%
out on a beautiful piece of
stationary and create a ritual

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.193 align:middle line:90%
to release it to the universe.

00:11:33.193 --> 00:11:34.294 align:middle line:90%
I'll share with you what I did

00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.463 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll tell you
other ways to do it.

00:11:36.463 --> 00:11:39.433 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I got
out my calendar and I saw

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.635 align:middle line:84%
that there was a new
moon coming up which is

00:11:41.635 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
when I always start
new projects.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.206 align:middle line:84%
And I went down to
the ocean with my list

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:90%
and I read through it.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:49.576 align:middle line:84%
And I said a nice prayer
of gratitude over it

00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:50.744 align:middle line:90%
and I thanked the universe

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:53.313 align:middle line:84%
for sending me my
perfect right partner.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:54.981 align:middle line:90%
And then I burned the list

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:57.284 align:middle line:84%
and I scattered the
ashes into the ocean.

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.686 align:middle line:90%
And then I took myself to lunch

00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:01.688 align:middle line:84%
and I ordered a glass
of champagne.

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:04.257 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind I
toasted my soulmate.

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:07.294 align:middle line:84%
And I said the cosmic
welcome mat is now open.

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:08.495 align:middle line:90%
Show up whenever you can.

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But it had
to be a romantic man.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.665 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Yes, very romantic.

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:13.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: He had to
with this process.

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Exactly.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.469 align:middle line:90%
But if that sounds too strange

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:20.874 align:middle line:84%
or too complicated then you take
your list and you can put it

00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:24.277 align:middle line:84%
in a red or pink envelope,
put it under your pillow,

00:12:24.277 --> 00:12:25.812 align:middle line:84%
you can put it under
your mattress.

00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:28.048 align:middle line:84%
If you have a favorite
spiritual book,

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:30.116 align:middle line:84%
if you have a sacred alter
you can put it on top

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:32.118 align:middle line:84%
of your alter or
under your alter.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:35.589 align:middle line:84%
Or one of my favorite things to
do is write it on a small piece

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:39.459 align:middle line:84%
of paper, roll it up like a
scroll, put it inside a pink

00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:44.865 align:middle line:84%
or red helium balloon and then
release it to the heavens.

00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because it's important
that releasing and knowing

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and trusting that the
universe is not there to get us

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.039 align:middle line:90%
but is there to co-create.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:56.576 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Yeah I mean, imagine
you want to plan a garden.

00:12:56.576 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, you go and you till
the soil, you put in the seeds,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.116 align:middle line:84%
you add water and
some fertilizer.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.452 align:middle line:84%
And then you don't go out
there with a flashlight at 3:00

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.653 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and
pull on the leaf

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:09.155 align:middle line:84%
and say grow faster,
grow faster.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't do that
because you trust

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.426 align:middle line:84%
that Mother Nature is
going to grow this for you.

00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:15.996 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
thing with your list.

00:13:15.996 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
You get clarity, you write your
list, you release your list

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.137 align:middle line:84%
and then you know and you
trust and you let it go.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And that's a big part

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:27.874 align:middle line:84%
that wasn't too specific
on the secret maybe.

00:13:27.874 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a lot of the
secret was taught here actually

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.711 align:middle line:90%
with this group of people.

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:34.281 align:middle line:84%
So, what do you think that
missing component was?

00:13:34.281 --> 00:13:35.582 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Yeah, the missing part

00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:38.551 align:middle line:84%
in the secret was the
emotional component.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.121 align:middle line:90%
So it's ask, believe, receive.

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now you can ask, believe,
receive until you're blue

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.192 align:middle line:84%
in the face but if you
don't feel in your body

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:49.362 align:middle line:84%
that you're deserving of
what you've asked for,

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:52.232 align:middle line:84%
that what you've asked
for is already yours

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:55.135 align:middle line:84%
on some level, it
can't come to you.

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:59.072 align:middle line:84%
Because the law of attraction
states we draw to us the people,

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:02.676 align:middle line:84%
places and experiences that
match our state of being.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.545 align:middle line:84%
So if my state of being is
I'm so fortunate to have

00:14:05.545 --> 00:14:08.014 align:middle line:84%
so much love in my life,
what do you think I'm going

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.249 align:middle line:90%
to get more of?

00:14:09.249 --> 00:14:12.052 align:middle line:84%
Right, more love, I can't
help but have more love.

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:15.755 align:middle line:84%
But if my thinking is I want
love but I'm such a loser,

00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:18.792 align:middle line:84%
I don't deserve love,
I'm too old, I'm too fat,

00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:21.895 align:middle line:84%
I'm too damaged, all
the good ones are taken

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.097 align:middle line:84%
that is going to
be my experience.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I did for myself
was I invented a process

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.337 align:middle line:90%
that I call a feelingization.

00:14:30.337 --> 00:14:33.473 align:middle line:84%
So a visualization takes
place in your head.

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:38.244 align:middle line:84%
A feelingization I drop you
from your head to your heart

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:42.048 align:middle line:84%
and then we re-experience
moments in our life

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:45.352 align:middle line:84%
where we felt love or
gratitude or appreciation.

00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:49.856 align:middle line:84%
And then once you're in those
states, in those feelings,

00:14:49.856 --> 00:14:52.158 align:middle line:84%
then you drop in the
desires for a soulmate

00:14:52.158 --> 00:14:54.761 align:middle line:84%
as if it's happening
right now in this moment

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:56.629 align:middle line:84%
because quantum physics
has proven

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.498 align:middle line:90%
that the unified field exists.

00:14:58.498 --> 00:14:59.833 align:middle line:90%
You and I are already connected.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:01.635 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time we're meeting

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:90%
and we're sharing molecules

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
but on some field we've
been connected forever.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.909 align:middle line:84%
You are already connected
to your soulmate.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.278 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is
drop into your heart,

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.314 align:middle line:84%
get present to what
love feels like

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:16.182 align:middle line:90%
and we've all experienced love.

00:15:16.182 --> 00:15:19.486 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say even your
pets can be your soulmates.

00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.622 align:middle line:84%
So if you're insisting nobody
loves you but you have a dog

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:25.358 align:middle line:84%
that loves you, tap into the
feeling of your dog looking

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:26.693 align:middle line:90%
into your eyes and loving you.

00:15:26.693 --> 00:15:30.897 align:middle line:84%
And then know that on some
cosmic level you can begin the

00:15:30.897 --> 00:15:32.932 align:middle line:84%
conversation today
with your soulmate.

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:34.601 align:middle line:90%
You can begin to talk to them.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.537 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to
welcome them in.

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:39.906 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And once you have
released and you feel it

00:15:39.906 --> 00:15:43.309 align:middle line:84%
and there's really not much to
do or just follow your intuition

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.246 align:middle line:84%
and go to certain places or how
do you actually live your life

00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:47.680 align:middle line:90%
from that point forward?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.615 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Really good question.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.016 align:middle line:90%
So there's a couple of things.

00:15:50.016 --> 00:15:53.219 align:middle line:84%
First thing I would do is what
I call creating a vision board

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:56.322 align:middle line:84%
or treasure map where you
cut out pictures and images

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.792 align:middle line:84%
and words from magazines
and collage them

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:02.062 align:middle line:84%
so that you're making a visual
representation of the future

00:16:02.062 --> 00:16:03.163 align:middle line:90%
that you're co-creating.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:05.832 align:middle line:84%
And then you, and spend
some time meditating

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.334 align:middle line:84%
with this every day, you
know, just being with it

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.336 align:middle line:84%
and projecting yourself
into the future

00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:12.172 align:middle line:90%
and feeling it and seeing it.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:14.607 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to
feather the nest.

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I like to prepare my
home for a soulmate.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.847 align:middle line:84%
So one of the first things I
would suggest that you do is

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
if you lived with a partner
in this home in the past,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
their energy is still there and
you want to clear the energy

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.722 align:middle line:84%
out even if it was
a good relationship.

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.659 align:middle line:84%
You want to clear the
decks, clean the space.

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:34.527 align:middle line:84%
So one of the easiest
things to do is

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:36.229 align:middle line:84%
to hire a professional
energy worker

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:37.664 align:middle line:90%
and have him do it for you.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.667 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do the Native
American technique of smudging

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:45.572 align:middle line:84%
where you get some sage, put
it on a plate, have it smoking

00:16:45.572 --> 00:16:48.741 align:middle line:84%
and then you take the smoke
and you run it over the doors

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.077 align:middle line:84%
and the windows and in
and out all the closets.

00:16:51.077 --> 00:16:54.547 align:middle line:84%
And this sacred smoke
purifies your space.

00:16:54.547 --> 00:16:56.148 align:middle line:90%
So you're cleaning the space.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.451 align:middle line:84%
I also like to use
a little Feng Shui

00:16:58.451 --> 00:16:59.786 align:middle line:90%
where clear out the clutter.

00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:02.422 align:middle line:84%
We all know that
clutter blocks energy.

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:06.626 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to literally
create space in the home.

00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:09.562 align:middle line:84%
So you want to go
into your bedroom

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:12.799 align:middle line:84%
and make sure the night stand on
their side of the bed is empty

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.868 align:middle line:90%
and ready for their stuff.

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.436 align:middle line:84%
Clean out one drawer
in the dresser.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:19.304 align:middle line:84%
Make one drawer totally
empty just for them.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.508 align:middle line:84%
Give them a few inches
in the closet

00:17:21.508 --> 00:17:23.275 align:middle line:90%
so they can hang a few things.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.011 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you're
really generous go out

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and buy them a new bathrobe and
leave the tags hanging on it

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.083 align:middle line:84%
so that they know you've
been expecting them

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.918 align:middle line:84%
and welcoming them
and that, you know,

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
they have a toothbrush
and a bathrobe here.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.924 align:middle line:84%
You know, clear out half a
shelf in the bathroom cabinet.

00:17:37.924 --> 00:17:41.327 align:middle line:84%
If you have a two car
garage, park on your side.

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:42.896 align:middle line:90%
Make space for their car.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard the phrase
that nature abhors a vacuum.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.135 align:middle line:84%
So this is why we're
literally making space.

00:17:49.135 --> 00:17:52.839 align:middle line:84%
We're sending this message to
the universe hey, over here,

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:84%
I've got room in my
life for another person.

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:59.379 align:middle line:84%
And then I also want you to
make space in your calendar.

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:04.384 align:middle line:84%
Don't fill up every minute of
every day with things to do.

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.985 align:middle line:84%
You know, like if
it's a Thursday night,

00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:07.987 align:middle line:90%
block out 8:00 to 10:00 o'clock.

00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.088 align:middle line:90%
Date with my soulmate.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:11.925 align:middle line:84%
Now they might not show
up on that Thursday

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:90%
but you've created the space.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.762 align:middle line:90%
Use that space creatively.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:84%
Use that space to savor the
waiting of your soulmate,

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:22.001 align:middle line:90%
to anticipate their arrival

00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:25.972 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy how much freedom
you have in this moment.

00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:28.441 align:middle line:84%
Because what no one will tell
you is once your soulmate

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:32.045 align:middle line:84%
arrives, you don't get
that time back ever again.

00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:33.379 align:middle line:90%
You don't get that alone time.

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.849 align:middle line:84%
Now everything has
to be coordinated.

00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:36.583 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:37.483 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:38.251 align:middle line:90%
When are we together?

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:39.786 align:middle line:90%
When are we not together?

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.622 align:middle line:84%
So this, these last
days of being single,

00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.923 align:middle line:90%
treat them for what they are.

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:46.025 align:middle line:90%
They're precious moments.

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:47.427 align:middle line:84%
You know, what are
you going to use them

00:18:47.427 --> 00:18:50.396 align:middle line:84%
for that you won't be
able to do in the future?

00:18:50.396 --> 00:18:51.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And then
the real healing

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:56.002 align:middle line:84%
and the real work starts I feel
when we meet our soulmate, no?

00:18:56.002 --> 00:18:57.036 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Yes.

00:18:57.036 --> 00:18:58.404 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It brings
up a lot of stuff.

00:18:58.404 --> 00:18:59.906 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Yeah, actually Harville
Hendrix has this great line

00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:01.174 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:02.675 align:middle line:84%
He says, you know you're
in the right relationship

00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:05.578 align:middle line:84%
when it starts off
as a dream come true

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:08.681 align:middle line:84%
and then rapidly devolves
into your worst nightmare.

00:19:08.681 --> 00:19:10.116 align:middle line:90%
And the reason for this is

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:13.319 align:middle line:84%
because a true sacred
relationship will kick

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.121 align:middle line:90%
up all your childhood wounds.

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.523 align:middle line:84%
And we're there to
heal each other.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:19.492 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've heard the
phrase relationships are

00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:20.827 align:middle line:90%
a mirror.

00:19:20.827 --> 00:19:22.528 align:middle line:84%
You know, it always looks
like the problem's over there

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.597 align:middle line:84%
but really a lot of times
the problem's over here

00:19:24.597 --> 00:19:27.066 align:middle line:84%
and they're reflecting
back to us the places

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
in which we're wounded or
unhealed or have hurts.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.106 align:middle line:84%
And we need to work
things through.

00:19:33.106 --> 00:19:37.043 align:middle line:84%
So a relationship's a growing
and healing process too.

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:39.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Do we have to
say no to some other,

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
for people looking
for their soulmate.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.484 align:middle line:84%
Do they have to say no to people
coming in or Mr. Right Now

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:49.656 align:middle line:84%
or other men until it really
fits and really feels great?

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:52.025 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Well yes.

00:19:52.025 --> 00:19:56.296 align:middle line:84%
The simple answer is yes but the
way I believe it is if you're

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:58.765 align:middle line:84%
with somebody right
now and you know

00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:01.834 align:middle line:84%
with certainty they're not
your soulmate then why are you

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:03.269 align:middle line:90%
spending time with them?

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:06.572 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to put two
cars in one parking space.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.074 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:12.078 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody else's energy is
taking up space in your life,

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:16.382 align:middle line:84%
it's blocking love which is why
I tell people if you're serious

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:19.085 align:middle line:84%
about manifesting your
soulmate, you're not going

00:20:19.085 --> 00:20:22.422 align:middle line:84%
to be having random
casual sex with anybody

00:20:22.422 --> 00:20:23.823 align:middle line:90%
who isn't your soulmate.

00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:24.957 align:middle line:90%
Because when we're intimate

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:27.727 align:middle line:84%
with another human being
we leave energetic hooks

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
in each other, we're
energetically connected more

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.299 align:middle line:90%
so for women then for men.

00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:36.002 align:middle line:84%
So if you're having sex
with your neighbor or sex

00:20:36.002 --> 00:20:40.006 align:middle line:84%
with your ex because it's fun
and it's relaxing or whatever,

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.774 align:middle line:84%
you're really blocking
the process.

00:20:41.774 --> 00:20:43.042 align:middle line:90%
Because if I said to you,

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:46.079 align:middle line:84%
Lilou I guarantee you your
soulmate's going to knock

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:48.314 align:middle line:90%
on your door in 72 hours,

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:50.817 align:middle line:84%
would you have sex this
afternoon with your ex?

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.752 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't right?

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:55.221 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know when the
soulmate's going to arrive.

00:20:55.221 --> 00:20:57.223 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying you
don't have any sex at all.

00:20:57.223 --> 00:20:59.525 align:middle line:84%
Self-pleasure is a great
thing to do and, you know,

00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:02.362 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been talking to
lots of people like John Gray

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:04.097 align:middle line:90%
who talk about oxytocin.

00:21:04.097 --> 00:21:05.631 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem with that.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:08.368 align:middle line:84%
But if you're serious about
manifesting your true love,

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:84%
your soulmate, then that's who
you want to be having sex with.

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:13.706 align:middle line:90%
Now one other piece of this

00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:15.608 align:middle line:84%
because I know you've got
a sophisticated audience.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:19.112 align:middle line:84%
If you are self-pleasuring,
you know, at the point

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:22.749 align:middle line:84%
of orgasm send all that
energy to your soulmate

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't met yet.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.285 align:middle line:90%
Send that love to them.

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.588 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
people, people, you know,

00:21:28.588 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%
they say can I fanaticize
about somebody?

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.892 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, fanaticize about
the one who's coming.

00:21:32.892 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
know their face.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.562 align:middle line:84%
But fanaticize how great it's
going to be to be with them.

00:21:36.562 --> 00:21:38.998 align:middle line:84%
And then send them
all that energy.

00:21:38.998 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh my God,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.269 align:middle line:84%
I had actually had a fantastic
conversation with Sarina Stone

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:46.506 align:middle line:84%
that is all about actually
recycling the orgasmic energy

00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:50.109 align:middle line:84%
so that we can reduce
the aging process, huh?

00:21:50.109 --> 00:21:52.745 align:middle line:84%
That's also a whole
other conversation.

00:21:52.745 --> 00:21:55.381 align:middle line:84%
But she would say no, no, no,
don't release, don't release.

00:21:55.381 --> 00:21:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So I love how different people
have different perspective

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.485 align:middle line:90%
and that's all good, you know.

00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:01.821 align:middle line:90%
I love remaining open

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.757 align:middle line:84%
to all this although some
things fit better than others.

00:22:04.757 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: I've heard that for men
that they should recycle it

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.829 align:middle line:84%
but I've never heard that
it was good for women to do.

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.831 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to see the
research on it.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:13.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And how is that,
yeah she did [inaudible]

00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.635 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Dallas [inaudible]
I'm not a Dallas,

00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:18.004 align:middle line:84%
I'm all about you know
what, pleasure is pleasure

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and we all need more of
it and builds oxytocin

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.275 align:middle line:90%
and it builds serotonin.

00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:25.378 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we're working
hard enough so I'd say go

00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:26.712 align:middle line:90%
for the pleasure myself.

00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:28.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:22:28.114 --> 00:22:33.653 align:middle line:84%
Once we meet our soulmate then
do you have some recommendation

00:22:33.653 --> 00:22:37.457 align:middle line:84%
there so that we don't
push this big love away?

00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:40.526 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: And I would say before
you meet your soulmate become a

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.061 align:middle line:90%
student of love.

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:43.663 align:middle line:90%
You know, do you like to cook?

00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:45.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Okay, how many cookbooks
do you have in your kitchen?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.568 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Few.

00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:49.535 align:middle line:90%
>> AF: Just a few?

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:50.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah just
a few because I

00:22:50.536 --> 00:22:51.938 align:middle line:84%
like to be spontaneous
and creative.

00:22:51.938 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: All right but most cooks
have like at least 10 all right

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.143 align:middle line:84%
because that's a subject
they're passionate about.

00:22:57.143 --> 00:22:58.377 align:middle line:90%
So if you're passionate

00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:01.681 align:middle line:84%
about having a great
relationship, you want to study.

00:23:01.681 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
What does it take to
have great communication

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.654 align:middle line:84%
and great compatibility
and be a wonderful partner?

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:11.557 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are not born
knowing how to do this.

00:23:11.557 --> 00:23:13.893 align:middle line:84%
And most of us didn't
grow up with parents

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:16.662 align:middle line:84%
who demonstrated how
to have a deeply loving

00:23:16.662 --> 00:23:18.498 align:middle line:90%
satisfying relationship.

00:23:18.498 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So I say become a
student of love now.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
There are wonderful books and
workshops and teleseminars

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and twice a year I
do these free events.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.176 align:middle line:84%
You can go lovesummit.com
to see them

00:23:30.176 --> 00:23:32.445 align:middle line:84%
where you can get this
information and learn how

00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:34.947 align:middle line:90%
to be a fabulous partner.

00:23:34.947 --> 00:23:36.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Any other
advice that you would

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:40.186 align:middle line:84%
like to close this beautiful
conversation that is important

00:23:40.186 --> 00:23:42.121 align:middle line:84%
to talk about when we
talk about soulmates?

00:23:42.121 --> 00:23:45.091 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Yeah, I would
really want to remind people

00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:50.696 align:middle line:84%
that big love is possible for
everybody, absolutely everybody.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:53.499 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of your
age or weight or size

00:23:53.499 --> 00:23:56.435 align:middle line:84%
or the only thing you need
to do is be willing to give

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:59.372 align:middle line:84%
up some old myths
and negative beliefs.

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:02.175 align:middle line:84%
And then put a little time
and energy and intention

00:24:02.175 --> 00:24:04.377 align:middle line:84%
and attention onto
your love life

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:07.547 align:middle line:84%
because we're all
deserving of great love.

00:24:07.547 --> 00:24:09.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I have one last
little question actually

00:24:09.315 --> 00:24:11.751 align:middle line:84%
that just popped because
I read this on your site.

00:24:11.751 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It was possible to turn
a mate into a soulmate?

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.622 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Yes, that's the
subject of my latest book.

00:24:16.622 --> 00:24:19.825 align:middle line:84%
It's called Wabi Sabi
Love - The Ancient Art

00:24:19.825 --> 00:24:23.529 align:middle line:84%
of Finding Perfect Love in
Imperfect Relationships.

00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:27.099 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about how to be
more playful and have more fun

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.635 align:middle line:84%
and take the stuff that
makes you absolutely crazy

00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:31.737 align:middle line:84%
about your mate and
make it something

00:24:31.737 --> 00:24:34.774 align:middle line:84%
that you can really
fall in love with.

00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.876 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So, any other tips?

00:24:36.876 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:84%
Where do we start because
there is some things,

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:44.617 align:middle line:84%
I know that this is, let's just
go on for five more minutes

00:24:44.617 --> 00:24:46.252 align:middle line:84%
on this because this
is important.

00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:49.956 align:middle line:84%
I feel that many people
do love their partner

00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:52.692 align:middle line:84%
and things have shifted and
changed and maybe it's not

00:24:52.692 --> 00:24:55.895 align:middle line:84%
at the same place of magic
and where it was before.

00:24:55.895 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many
beautiful memories and there's

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.132 align:middle line:84%
so many beautiful things and
I do believe deep in my heart

00:25:00.132 --> 00:25:02.902 align:middle line:84%
that people can transform
and change.

00:25:02.902 --> 00:25:06.772 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Well it's not so much
about the other person changing.

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: As we change.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.612 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Yeah, so Wabi Sabi's
an ancient Japanese aesthetic

00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:16.482 align:middle line:84%
that honors all things old,
worn, weathered, imperfect,

00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:19.285 align:middle line:84%
impermanent and it
seeks to find beauty

00:25:19.285 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and perfection in imperfection.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.156 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we had a big vase
and it had a crooked crack

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:25.691 align:middle line:90%
down the middle of it.

00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:28.694 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese would put this
broken vase on a pedestal

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:31.631 align:middle line:84%
and then they would shine
a spotlight on the crack.

00:25:31.631 --> 00:25:35.501 align:middle line:84%
So in Wabi Sabi Love we learn
to love and accept the cracks

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:38.504 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves and
especially those of our mate.

00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:41.874 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we do that
is we realize they didn't wake

00:25:41.874 --> 00:25:43.809 align:middle line:84%
up this morning thinking
how am I going

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:45.544 align:middle line:90%
to drive my wife crazy today?

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.946 align:middle line:90%
They're not thinking that way.

00:25:46.946 --> 00:25:50.216 align:middle line:84%
They're waking up the same way
we wake up which is I just want

00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:53.019 align:middle line:84%
to be loved and accepted
for exactly who I am.

00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:56.389 align:middle line:84%
So if they're doing things
that are making you crazy,

00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:58.991 align:middle line:84%
it's not because they
purposely want to do it,

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:02.061 align:middle line:84%
they may just have a blind spot
to it and it may be the thing

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:04.397 align:middle line:84%
that you don't like
the way it is,

00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:06.298 align:middle line:84%
so you have to find a
fun way to deal with it.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:07.733 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So, so when it comes
to toothpaste,

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.074 align:middle line:84%
I like to squeeze my toothpaste
from the bottom and roll it up.

00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:17.743 align:middle line:84%
Brian comes in, he grabs the
toothpaste and he squeezes

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:20.179 align:middle line:84%
from the middle and he
mangles the tube of toothpaste.

00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:23.416 align:middle line:84%
So the first couple years we
were married every time I looked

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.985 align:middle line:84%
at my messed up tube of
toothpaste I'd say to him,

00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:27.253 align:middle line:90%
why can't you do it right?

00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you just
squeeze it from the bottom?

00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:31.724 align:middle line:84%
And he would look at me like
are you out of your mind?

00:26:31.724 --> 00:26:33.259 align:middle line:90%
Are you crazy?

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it
would never change.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.297 align:middle line:84%
I could complain about it for
years but it would never change.

00:26:38.297 --> 00:26:39.598 align:middle line:90%
So one day I'm thinking okay,

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.868 align:middle line:84%
what's the Wabi Sabi
solution to the toothpaste?

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:44.336 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at it,
I'm looking it

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:45.805 align:middle line:90%
and I can't think of anything.

00:26:45.805 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:90%
And finally it hits me.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.878 align:middle line:84%
Thank God I married a man
who brushes his teeth.

00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:55.047 align:middle line:84%
Now every time I
see the toothpaste

00:26:55.047 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm straightening
it out, I'm happy.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:58.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Grateful.

00:26:58.851 --> 00:27:01.253 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: I'm so grateful he
brushed his teeth again.

00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:04.123 align:middle line:84%
Now that's sounds like a
simple thing but the shift

00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:06.559 align:middle line:90%
that was made, he didn't change,

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:10.029 align:middle line:84%
my story about the
toothpaste changed.

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
with anything.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.065 align:middle line:90%
So here's how he did it with me.

00:27:13.065 --> 00:27:16.602 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a real
slob in the kitchen.

00:27:16.602 --> 00:27:17.603 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sloppy.

00:27:17.603 --> 00:27:19.171 align:middle line:90%
And he would be saying to me,

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
why do you always leave
crumbs on the counter?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.374 align:middle line:90%
I said I did?

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.677 align:middle line:90%
I do? I don't see the crumbs.

00:27:24.677 --> 00:27:26.645 align:middle line:84%
After months of this he said
to me he goes, you know,

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.214 align:middle line:90%
I figured something out.

00:27:28.214 --> 00:27:31.317 align:middle line:84%
He said the crumbs bother
me, they don't bother you

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:34.019 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going to
clean up after you.

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.187 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just that simple.

00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Now of course this doesn't
work for everything.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:84%
If there's bad behavior,
abuse or addiction,

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.195 align:middle line:84%
you can't Wabi Sabi
your way out of that.

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:45.064 align:middle line:90%
You need professional help.

00:27:45.064 --> 00:27:47.833 align:middle line:84%
But anything else, any
other annoying traits,

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:52.538 align:middle line:84%
find some lighthearted
humorous way to shift on this.

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:53.806 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How about in a couple

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:56.075 align:middle line:84%
where the other one is
not spiritual and that,

00:27:56.075 --> 00:27:58.844 align:middle line:84%
and you had a spiritual
awakening and it drives you nuts

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.746 align:middle line:84%
that the other one
doesn't get it?

00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:03.349 align:middle line:84%
>> AF: Because you're not as
spiritual as you think you are,

00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:06.318 align:middle line:84%
you're being judging,
you're being judgmental.

00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:07.419 align:middle line:84%
This happened to
a friend of mine

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:08.888 align:middle line:84%
and the story's in
Wabi Sabi Love.

00:28:08.888 --> 00:28:13.859 align:middle line:84%
So my friend Jill always dated
these very new agey spiritual

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:15.127 align:middle line:90%
guys who were just like her.

00:28:15.127 --> 00:28:19.165 align:middle line:84%
They were raw, vegan, organic
cotton clothing wearing,

00:28:19.165 --> 00:28:22.268 align:middle line:84%
always shopped at
Gaiam, always, you know.

00:28:22.268 --> 00:28:25.271 align:middle line:84%
Did yoga, chanted,
prayed, you know,

00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:27.373 align:middle line:84%
consider themselves
very spiritual.

00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Those were her guys.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.309 align:middle line:84%
Then she moved home
to New Jersey,

00:28:30.309 --> 00:28:34.313 align:middle line:84%
ran into her ex-boyfriend from
college, they fell in love,

00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:36.949 align:middle line:84%
they got engaged, they
moved into together.

00:28:36.949 --> 00:28:39.418 align:middle line:84%
And every time I talked to
her, when's the wedding?

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:40.252 align:middle line:90%
When's the wedding?

00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:41.654 align:middle line:90%
Oh I don't know, I don't know.

00:28:41.654 --> 00:28:45.191 align:middle line:84%
Finally after four years it's
like what's going on with you?

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:46.892 align:middle line:90%
She said I can't marry him.

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:47.927 align:middle line:90%
I said why?

00:28:47.927 --> 00:28:50.262 align:middle line:90%
He's just not spiritual enough.

00:28:50.262 --> 00:28:51.997 align:middle line:84%
It's like what do
you mean by that?

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:55.534 align:middle line:84%
She said well, you know, he
works as a motorcycle repairman,

00:28:55.534 --> 00:28:58.103 align:middle line:84%
he goes hunting, he
brings home ducks

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:00.272 align:middle line:90%
and he eats meat, you know.

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:01.707 align:middle line:90%
He does all these things.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:03.876 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't pray, he doesn't
meditate, he doesn't do yoga,

00:29:03.876 --> 00:29:05.344 align:middle line:90%
he's just not spiritual enough.

00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:08.514 align:middle line:84%
So they broke up but this was
when the recession started

00:29:08.514 --> 00:29:10.716 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't
afford to separate.

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.218 align:middle line:90%
So they lived together.

00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:14.286 align:middle line:84%
Then she got really,
really sick.

00:29:14.286 --> 00:29:16.488 align:middle line:84%
And he took really
good care of her.

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:17.823 align:middle line:90%
And then finally she got better.

00:29:17.823 --> 00:29:19.758 align:middle line:84%
And then one morning he
came through the backdoor

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:23.529 align:middle line:84%
with his rifle and his hunting
dog and a couple of dead ducks

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:25.965 align:middle line:84%
and she said to him,
how was your morning?

00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:29.435 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her it was so
beautiful, the sun was coming up

00:29:29.435 --> 00:29:32.071 align:middle line:84%
and the light was
filtering through the leaves

00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and I could hear the leaves
crunching under my boots.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was just, and she's
thinking to herself, oh my God,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.246 align:middle line:90%
he's describing a temple, right.

00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:41.814 align:middle line:84%
And she's starting
to get this hint.

00:29:41.814 --> 00:29:44.283 align:middle line:84%
Oh maybe that's his
spirituality.

00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:46.185 align:middle line:84%
Then a few days later
he comes home from work

00:29:46.185 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:90%
in tears, he's all upset.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.022 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?

00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:51.357 align:middle line:90%
My boss Bob died today.

00:29:51.357 --> 00:29:53.559 align:middle line:90%
He had a heart attack, he died.

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:55.261 align:middle line:90%
The funeral's in two days.

00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:56.295 align:middle line:90%
Would you go with me?

00:29:56.295 --> 00:29:57.696 align:middle line:84%
And she said oh yes,
of course I'll go.

00:29:57.696 --> 00:30:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing I haven't told you
is he's very shy, this boyfriend

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.568 align:middle line:90%
of hers, very, very shy.

00:30:02.568 --> 00:30:06.906 align:middle line:84%
So they go to the funeral,
300 bikers are there,

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:08.374 align:middle line:90%
somebody gives the eulogy.

00:30:08.374 --> 00:30:11.944 align:middle line:84%
And at the end they say if
anybody else would like to come

00:30:11.944 --> 00:30:15.214 align:middle line:84%
up and say a few works
about Bob do it now.

00:30:15.214 --> 00:30:16.615 align:middle line:90%
Nobody moved.

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:21.053 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly her finance Ray is
out of his chair, he's standing

00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:23.022 align:middle line:84%
in front of the room
and he's talking

00:30:23.022 --> 00:30:25.557 align:middle line:90%
about what a good man Bob was.

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.626 align:middle line:84%
He was a good father,
a good brother,

00:30:27.626 --> 00:30:29.094 align:middle line:90%
a good boss, a good friend.

00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And now Jill is in tears because
she has this Wabi Sabi epiphany.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.504 align:middle line:84%
She realizes she is not the
spiritually awakened one

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:40.572 align:middle line:90%
in this relationship, he is.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:44.143 align:middle line:84%
But because his spirituality
didn't look like hers,

00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:48.047 align:middle line:84%
she's been sitting in
judgment all these years.

00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:50.816 align:middle line:84%
And now they're finally
happily together.

00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:52.818 align:middle line:90%
So, you know, this whole thing

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:57.122 align:middle line:84%
that we're judging people
just creates toxicity.

00:30:57.122 --> 00:30:59.058 align:middle line:84%
You know, what you want to
look at is how do you feel

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:01.126 align:middle line:90%
when you're with them, you know?

00:31:01.126 --> 00:31:03.295 align:middle line:84%
Are you loving each
other, you know?

00:31:03.295 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Are you creating
a life together?

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.765 align:middle line:90%
Are they a good person?

00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:09.134 align:middle line:84%
You know, for some people the
most spiritual experience they

00:31:09.134 --> 00:31:12.271 align:middle line:84%
can have is a pick-up
basketball game, you know,

00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:13.839 align:middle line:84%
where they're being
a team player

00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:16.041 align:middle line:84%
and they're being a
good person, you know.

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:18.277 align:middle line:84%
Well are they giving the
homeless person money?

00:31:18.277 --> 00:31:19.845 align:middle line:90%
That's a spiritual act.

00:31:19.845 --> 00:31:22.114 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can be eating
the cleanest diet in the world

00:31:22.114 --> 00:31:25.317 align:middle line:84%
and still get cancer,
you know, so.

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:30.356 align:middle line:84%
I really caution women to, you
know, he's got to be spiritual.

00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:32.591 align:middle line:84%
You know, I understand if
you're a practicing Catholic

00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:34.493 align:middle line:84%
and you want to raise your
children Catholic and you want

00:31:34.493 --> 00:31:35.928 align:middle line:90%
to go to mass every week,

00:31:35.928 --> 00:31:38.464 align:middle line:84%
that's a deal breaker,
that's a requirement.

00:31:38.464 --> 00:31:42.334 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us who claim
to be awakened and conscious,

00:31:42.334 --> 00:31:46.138 align:middle line:84%
we need to broaden our
beliefs about spirituality.

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:47.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.641 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much Arielle
