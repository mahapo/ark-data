00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm in beautiful,
sunny, delicious,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:84%
amazing-- it feels so good
to be in Montpellier in south

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:90%
of France.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you, Hira.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA HOSEN: Hi.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So this is quite
special because you live

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:90%
in France.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
You have this beautiful
family, yet you're this zen nun

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's quite different.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're one of the
certified teachers

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:84%
of Drunvalo's
beautiful workshop,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Awakening the Illuminated Heart.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited to
speak of the heart.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is a
huge topic right now.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:10%
People are awakening to
the beauty of their heart

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.455 align:middle line:10%
and to the dreams and
to this magnificent life

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:00.329 align:middle line:10%
that we can all have.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
We want it.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:90%
We want to live it.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited to
discover before going

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
into the technique and all
the more practical things.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you know
people on Gaiam,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we're just all thirsty in the
community for more information,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%
aren't we?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:90%
So this is like bubbling up.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.006 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.505 align:middle line:84%
You're Dutch
originally, aren't you?

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True, yes.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dutch and I'm living
in France since nine years.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.922 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You have a
beautiful little baby girl,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
and you're this zen nun.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does this
work all together?

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of new.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:10%
It's like a modern zen nun.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm married to a Zen master.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:10%
So that's special.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And we're living
in a Zen temple.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And our daughter
is six years old,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:10%
so she lives in
the middle of that.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:90%
She goes to school.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We live a normal life,
but we are spiritual.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:90%
We are meditating every day.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: How many hours?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: Just one
and a half hours.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
You do sitting 40
minutes without moving.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you do a walking
meditation for 10 minutes.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.441 align:middle line:84%
And then you do sitting
again, for 40 minutes around.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:90%
You do this every day.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing this
since 14 years.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So then you can really
feel what it's doing.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
If you do it one time
a week, it's strong.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it every day since
14 years, you feel what it is.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's basically, like,
zen is not a religion,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.835 align:middle line:90%
or not even a philosophy.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You practice this
type of meditation,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:90%
which is a simple one.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You don't think.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't move.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.110 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
You are awake while
you are meditating.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So you don't
live-- this temple is not

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.330 align:middle line:90%
in Monpellier.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
You're in the middle of
the-- because here, we're

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.649 align:middle line:90%
in the center, actually.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We're in the city center of
Montepllier in the Jardin des

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.245 align:middle line:84%
Plantes, and it's one of
your favorites place here.

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
It's so amazing.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
If you come to Montpellier,
you have to stop in this place.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:90%
It's so juicy.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
This is like a 1,000
year old garden.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So the earth is
really respected here.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:90%
It's really beautiful.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, no, I live like
two hours away from here

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:90%
in the mountains.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the middle
of nowhere, really.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It's in the mountains.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So what
got you to be a nun?

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about your journey,
too, so that then we

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:10%
can talk of the teachings
and how you're living now,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:10%
and what actually you want
to experience more and more.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, I guess, you're
are on the journey, too.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We're all in this
journey, aren't we?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have been
searching a lot.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I think the beginning
of my spiritual journey

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
you could say it's about 20
years ago when I went to India.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
With, of course, the
mission to find--

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: What were you, five?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: --to find myself.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.661 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm 40.

00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.865 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So living in the
heart keeps you young and--

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: And beautiful
if you're happy.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it all
started there in India.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
received my name, Hira.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I didn't
really understand.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
I received already a
lot of tools-- a lot

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.149 align:middle line:84%
of instruments-- meditation,
living in the heart.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But you don't call
it like that yet.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism, all types
of tools that you learn

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And then more and more, I
started to develop them.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And also really
choose in my life

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to say OK, because I'm
also actually an engineer.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's industrial engineer
of management science.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:90%
So I have a Master of Science.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
you have to say OK,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
do I go into industrial
life as being an engineer,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.755 align:middle line:84%
or do I go for what I really
came for to do on this planet?

00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:90%
You know, my mission.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
So you have to choose.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.279 align:middle line:84%
But the more that you do
it, the more signs or things

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
of synchronicities
that are happening

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and that you know that
you're doing the right thing.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's been quite a road.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And now I know since let's
say five years around,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that I'm really doing what
I came to do on this planet.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.395 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: So teaching.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:10%
Sharing.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:10%
Teaching people how
to reopen their heart.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Is it what it is?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Or living
in the heart, really.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes people
come to do our worships,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.442 align:middle line:84%
and they expect to go out
after four days and say OK,

00:05:29.442 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Buddha now, or I'm a
Jesus now, and I can do this.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you have the tools.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
You will have found the tools.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But it still depends on
your level emotionally,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
mentally, spiritually,
physically.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.137 align:middle line:90%
How do you live?

00:05:47.137 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
What are your disciplines?

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
What are your habits?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
How do you think?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you have
the tools and you say OK,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking this serious.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going for a week
into this desert.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't do nothing.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I just focus on what
I've just learned

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going into the heart.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you'll get
there way faster than

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
if you go back into
whatever your job is.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You forget what
you've just learned.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:90%
You put the tool away.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And you forget about it.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on how
much you put into it.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's of
course also people

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.265 align:middle line:84%
that are so opening up
that they have no choice.

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
They are like I can't
go back to my job.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I'm so happy.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- I can't-- I
need to do something else.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's two ways.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It pushes you and it pulls you.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But also you have to, of
course, make some effort.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not an automatic plug.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it needs
a little bit of work.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: We hear you.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole-- I love the
spin that you have on things.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Like really living, building
inside, spending some more time

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:90%
inside rather than outside.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Tell us more about that.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah, that's the key.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Because we always-- it's normal.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We came to this world, a
3D dimensioned reality,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
where we believe that we need
to fix things on the outside.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
wrong on the outside,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.872 align:middle line:84%
so we're like I
need to fix this.

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I need to do something.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.913 align:middle line:84%
I need to think something,
do something, whatever.

00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I need to change it.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We never really learn
unless we're a child,

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:90%
we can still understand.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But we never really learned that
somebody says stop everything.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Going inside of your
heart and fix it

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
from there, from
your inside world.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Fix it from your heart.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Fix it in that way, you know.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
tune into that, the more

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
that you feel your heart
and what it's telling you--

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.575 align:middle line:84%
because your heart speaks to
you all the time, all the time.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:52.075 align:middle line:90%
It dreams.

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Your heart dreams all the time.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So the more that
you tune into that,

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the images or the feelings
or the thoughts or the

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
the more you tune into that,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
the more you will
change reality.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:84%
But from the inside out
and not from the outside.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: So it's the
power of imagination, too,

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:10%
or is it the heart that
really sends out images?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:84%
And how do you-- how
does that work out?

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:90%
How do you work this out?

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:84%
It all kind of starts
with imagination.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So imagine somebody that
never have done this.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Never meditated, never
went into the heart,

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and says OK, teach me.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Then yes, we'll start with
a sort of an imagination.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to
kind of tune into this,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
very subtle world.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not as tangible
as this world.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you're expecting to
see something as bright

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
as this tree or this building,
then you'll get confused.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you know that it's like
a dream kind of type of thing,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
more subtle, then you
can call it imagination.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.270 align:middle line:90%
It's very real.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that world that
we're speaking about now,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's more real than this one.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Like everything that exists here
in 3D came from that source,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.150 align:middle line:90%
came from that world.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're like, for
example, we say,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've just been
dreaming this last night.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.485 align:middle line:90%
We don't give any reality.

00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't say it's true
because it's just a dream,

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.032 align:middle line:84%
and all this is reality
because I can touch it.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's just the
other way around.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's completely the
other way around.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Like everything we can touch
and everything we can see,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.750 align:middle line:84%
it's all coming from
this subtle, you know,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:90%
imagery type of world.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't see-- because
a lot of people see stuff--

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm not such seer, so
I'm always jealous.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm like oh, they're seeing
auras and things and seers.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:90%
But you don't need to be a seer.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You can feel things,
or you can know things.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:90%
That's even more strong.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Like you just know it.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.794 align:middle line:90%
You're not seeing anything.

00:09:58.794 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
You're not sensing anything.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You're like feeling a
bit like oh, I'm blind.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not-- but you know.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's many different
ways of communicating

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
with your heart,
let's say, or letting

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:90%
your heart communicate to you.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, it just
starts flowing really.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very strong.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:21.723 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Is there a process
to it, or how do you--

00:10:21.723 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
why do we say it's awakening
the illuminated heart?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.185 align:middle line:90%
Why illuminated?

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, it was just
called Living in the Heart.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't call
it illuminated.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
We didn't call it
even awakening.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.808 align:middle line:84%
We called it living
in the heart.

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:41.590 align:middle line:90%
Then, actually, it was--

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You can hear the big
motor bikes and there's a big

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
road not far, so sorry for a
little bit of background noise.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:90%
But this is part of life, right?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're in Montpellier.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Guys are a little bit crazy.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.252 align:middle line:90%
This is summertime.

00:10:55.252 --> 00:10:56.354 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True.

00:10:56.354 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: They're living
maybe in their heart.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't know which
place they live from.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:90%
But they're having some fun.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, we
called it Living in the Heart,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
but then it was a
copyrighted, so we couldn't

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
call it Living in
the Heart anymore.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I was part of
the very first teacher

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:90%
training with Drunvalo.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And so we said, OK.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:90%
So we have to have a new name.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So he asked 100 people and said
let's come up with a new name.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And then this was the result.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:90%
From these 100 people.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We all gave our
suggestions, and it

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:84%
became Awakening the
Illuminated Heart.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what it really
is is it is an awakening.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:90%
It is a heart awakening.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what it is
it's living from the heart.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- you can
say there is a method--

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We have a
little cat behind us.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Oh, nice.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: He's visiting.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yay!

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I don't know if
you're going to see it.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.605 align:middle line:90%
I think he wants to say hello.

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
He wants to live
in the heart, too.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:90%
They live the heart, don't they?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
He's intrigued by your hat?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: That's exactly
where I want to go to.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.675 align:middle line:84%
It's like imagine that
you are painting something

00:12:02.675 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:90%
or you're dancing.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to
music and you're dancing.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
You are in your
heart at that moment.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:90%
You're completely in your heart.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
When you are inspired,
when you are creative,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
when you're channeling this love
that you have for the world,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:90%
you're in your heart.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The thing what we
learn in this workshop

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is to also do it when somebody's
screaming at you, when

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:84%
the neighbors are
criticizing you,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:84%
when people are
really hard on you.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
That's when it's
important to really learn,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, I can deal with
this from my heart.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to scream back.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to get upset.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I can deal with this.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So yes, we all have
spontaneous moments.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
We are all the
time in our hearts.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But we just lose
ourselves, and that's

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.287 align:middle line:84%
why it's nice to have kind of a
method to learn how to do this.

00:12:53.287 --> 00:12:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I guess there's
different levels, right?

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
There's the day to day,
but there's all the way

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:90%
to the ascension, et cetera.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So we can go a little
bit later on to that.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But the practical
aspect, day to day,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.057 align:middle line:84%
our heart has a tendency
to close and to shut down.

00:13:07.057 --> 00:13:08.765 align:middle line:84%
The main thing is to
keep the heart open.

00:13:08.765 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:10.717 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's like boom.

00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Or we feel it, and then
there's something happens.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So how do we-- how
does that work?

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah, it's a practice.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people think they
come and do a workshop with me

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and they think, oh, she says
a living in the heart teacher

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.640 align:middle line:84%
so she's probably like
a Buddha all the time.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have moments
where my ego takes over.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about the
ego in a negative sense.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of teachers or
spiritual lineages

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
have been talking
negative about the ego.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying kind of respect
your ego, you know.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
But just don't let it run you.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it control you.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
But I also have moments
where my ego controls me,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
where I'm a control freak or
I'm needy or I'm arrogant.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Whatever, you know.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's a practice.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the beginning,
I could recognize it,

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
but I would stay in that
ego for let's say hours.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And now I can recognize it
really fast, and I can say wow.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't from my heart.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can take it back.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I go inside of my heart and
I totally, in the moment,

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
change the reality of the
a situation that I'm in.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I can do it faster now.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of a practice.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
recognize it, or are you

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
just going to go
on automatic pilot

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
on your ego for the whole day?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.273 align:middle line:84%
Or are you going
to say oh, wait.

00:14:36.273 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Most of us use
gratitude to reopen the heart

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:10%
and try to just stop and
at least be conscious

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:10%
of the situation in gratitude.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the tools for you?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: You're right.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude, compassion.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Compassion is a really good one.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
If somebody, I don't know,
starts screaming on you

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
instead of thinking, well,
what's this person doing?

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You can feel that maybe
this person really

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the
tools that you have.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So that straight away
creates compassion.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, like--

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Stopping everything.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: Yeah,
stopping everything.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I love that one.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Just stop everything.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Like that's what you learn when
you do a lot of meditation.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
That's also kind one of
the keys of this workshop,

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is that you learn to live
in unity consciousness.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So instead of looking
at a situation saying

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
this is bad, this is good,
staying in this duality;

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
you pull yourself
out of it, and you

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:84%
say what's the
unity consciousness

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:90%
way of looking at this?

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you plug
into that, whatever

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is your way as you
say-- compassion,

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
gratitude-- just stop
everything basically.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And don't pull or
don't you push.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Just look at it,
observe it simply

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
as it is, then if you do that
like a few seconds already

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:90%
you are in unity consciousness.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:90%
You're there.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
If you can prolong
that, if you can

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
keep that going more than
an hour, you're in bliss.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:90%
You're in complete bliss.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
If you can do that for
two hours, three hours,

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.629 align:middle line:90%
you can do that the whole day.

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:90%
You are there.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.236 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What is your
spin on enlightenment?

00:16:20.236 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: My spin on
enlightenment is a very

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:10%
interesting question.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:10%
Because it's not so easy.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
ascension and enlightenment,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
they kind of like
come together for me.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Like there's different
ways, many different ways,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:84%
to get enlightened or
awake or to ascend.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Many different ways.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And so at a certain point,
they become one for me.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
If you really start ascending,
what is ascension is basically

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.555 align:middle line:84%
it's that your vibration
of your signature--

00:16:55.555 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
let's say your vibrational
signature of who you are--

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is getting higher and
higher and higher.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Your energy level gets
vibrating higher and higher.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So the more that you
ascend, the more kind

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:84%
of light or love
or higher vibration

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.899 align:middle line:90%
that you're pulling in.

00:17:11.899 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So the more that you do
that, of course, the more

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.079 align:middle line:90%
that you are awake.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.790 align:middle line:10%
So for me, it's all--
at a certain point,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.259 align:middle line:10%
it all becomes one.

00:17:20.259 --> 00:17:21.886 align:middle line:10%
It's all the same.

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: All the rest is
terms and vocabulary and words.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: True.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:10%
And different ways that
are all respectable.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:10%
Some people work harder
with different methods.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But some people just like
there's this beautiful story

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:90%
that I love of the Buddha.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, he takes
a flower and he turns it,

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and the person that
looks at it and smiles

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
will be the one who
is his successor.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:10%
It's a very simple
story, but it shows

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:10%
that it can be very simple
but at the same time

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:10%
we have all different
ways of getting there.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:10%
There's no one way.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.365 align:middle line:84%
There's millions of
ways to get there.

00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So the main thing,
whatever way we take is to take

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:84%
those decisions and make those
steps and move forward from

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:90%
the heart?

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.381 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:18:14.381 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: From the fear.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: It's to
find your own way.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's unique.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.965 align:middle line:10%
We're all ascending,
too, in a unique level.

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:10%
And we're all needed.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:10%
So the more that
you feel your way.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody's way will
be to dance every day.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They just put music on.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:90%
They dance.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to be a specific
lineage or dharma or whatever.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:90%
For me, I needed that.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
I needed literally, like
in the Zen meditation

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
you sit and you have like
it's like a wooden stick

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can ask for it and, you
know, they put you straight.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of a--
in Buddhism, it's

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.554 align:middle line:90%
one of the most strict lineages.

00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Because of course,
from the Buddha

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
there's millions of different.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And what it teaches you
is just to sit straight.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So me personally, I
needed this discipline

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to really get me
disciplined, because I

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.465 align:middle line:90%
was all over the place.

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I was flying all day long!

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I had no discipline,
even though that I'm

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
an engineer and all that.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:90%
I was just like out there.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
So I needed somebody to
really like-- not somebody,

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:84%
but like this teaching
to really become

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:90%
like centered, really centered.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Take the middle way.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Because I am also very extreme.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I can go that way and then
all the way to the other side.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
So I needed that.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's me.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else can be a gardener,
work with the earth all day.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:90%
That will be his or her way.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.751 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is an artist,
makes paintings or whatever.

00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: In
Drunvalo's teachings,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of
technical stuff.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:10%
How do you-- what do
you feel about that?

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.886 align:middle line:10%
Because we're the
next generation.

00:19:57.886 --> 00:19:59.760 align:middle line:10%
I just did a conference
yesterday in Avignon.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really feel
what you're saying,

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and I feel a lot of
us have this message.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.051 align:middle line:84%
What is the portion for you
on the technical aspect?

00:20:08.051 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:10%
Because it seems like,
on a certain level,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:10%
it's so simple and so easy and
accessible at the same time.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:10%
But part of the old teachers
have more different steps

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and techniques and
where you with that?

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: I'm, like, I'm a
good combination of them both.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I'm kind of a-- I
can combine a lot of extremes.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm one of those totally
free, hippie type of girls.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
You should have seen me
20 years ago in India.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Like really hippie, you know,
shamanism, drums, anything

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
I think techniques

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
are good because it's not
only just arriving to us.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
You can just tune
into it and be.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:90%
But most people need something.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
They need a technique or
some-- not stick behind a door,

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
but something to guide them.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:90%
So I say do them.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Do it all.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Do them both.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever works for you.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.154 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the last person
that say, oh, we

00:21:14.154 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:84%
don't need the
techniques anymore.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.278 align:middle line:84%
Just throw them
overboard and we'll just,

00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, sit here
and just be it.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, yes.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, there's so much

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to discover that are
in those techniques.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Like the ones of our school
is kriya yoga, kundalini yoga.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you have
to sit like, you know,

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
in know these positions, but
when you do it, if you do it--

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing this
every day, by the way.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you would
choose that, it will

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:90%
be more easy in a certain way.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So I say do the
combination of it all.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Feel that it's easy,
but at the same time

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
choose your
technique or your way

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and just really
practice and do it.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I'm thinking of the
third eye and the different

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
chakras and opening
them up and all that.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there some
things-- I'm talking

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.109 align:middle line:84%
of these techniques of Drunvalo
where you just go there

00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and you open this up, and
then you get your green light

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you flashback the heart
and you twist back forward,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you're in this
amazing illuminated space.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.433 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:25.189 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: Yeah, that's true.

00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: This is quite unique.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: I understand.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a very unique way.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The thing about that
what you're talking about

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
by opening the third
eye and then you

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
have these beams of
light that are activated.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And then actually, you
activate your marcaba,

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
which is a huge field,
electromagnetic field

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:90%
It's unique.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But actually, everybody
had and will have this.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like a seed that is
within us that will reactivate.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
because we're just

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
restarting to remember this,
is we're using techniques.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But maybe, my girl
of six years old

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:84%
will just take a bath one
day and it was all activated.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
She's like what's this
spinning field around me?

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, you know

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But I am willing to go through
the whole technique, which

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
is kind of the middle
way to activate it

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that for everyone else,
maybe we'll reach the 100

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
or whatever needs to be done
for the rest of humanity just

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.480 align:middle line:90%
to be like ah, you old people.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You had to go through
all those steps.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like yeah,
we did actually.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And we did it for you as well.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
All these things about opening
the third eye, what happens

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
actually is that it really
reconnects your brain

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:90%
to your heart.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only
living in the heart,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because the living in
the heart part is easy.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:84%
All you do is you move
your consciousness

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You reach your heart,
and you're there.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.932 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really easy part.

00:24:01.932 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
activate your marcaba,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that's a little bit
more complicated.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, easy
if you know the steps.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's that you reconnect
your brain to your heart.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
funny is what happens

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is that your brain
will become female,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're heart
will become male.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually
changing polarity.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.792 align:middle line:90%
It's a really special feeling.

00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
You're like whoa,
what's happening?

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people get very
sexual out of it,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- what you're
doing is realigning your body.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And we have all
this inside of us.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.672 align:middle line:90%
It's just we don't know.

00:24:40.672 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know that
this is inside of us.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
going back to school.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I'll
do this workshop.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
In four days, they'll explain to
me how my body actually works.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll just use it or
not use it, whatever you want.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:90%
But you know, it's techniques.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:10%
You're right.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.335 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of complicated--

00:25:01.335 --> 00:25:04.740 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Let's get into,
it's good to get a little bit

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:10%
into it.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.655 align:middle line:10%
Especially that thing, I like
the heart switched with the--

00:25:08.655 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: The polarity switch?

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it's very special.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:12.410 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Tell us more.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn, aren't we?

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.646 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're here.

00:25:18.646 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.829 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:25.706 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Explaining or why so--

00:25:25.706 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: It's like you have a
special type of organ inside

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.842 align:middle line:10%
your mouth, and you
can stimulate it.

00:25:33.842 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And while you're
doing that, you're

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:90%
actually creating alpha waves.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And alpha waves, it's
connected to your brain.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Like for example, babies.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:90%
They're full of alpha waves.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.924 align:middle line:84%
They are like almost
100% alpha waves.

00:25:46.924 --> 00:25:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So people are always going to
the babies and they're like,

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
oh, you cutie.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But actually, they are
trying to get their waves.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They think they're giving
something to the baby,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
but they are just like
attracted to their alpha waves.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So what it does is joy.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Like alpha waves, if you're
full of alpha waves, it's joy.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:90%
It's bliss.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It's very blissful energy.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So once we get 30, 40, 50, 60
all these waves in our brain

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:90%
are going to lower down.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.470 align:middle line:84%
When you're 70, you almost
have no alpha waves anymore.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why people that
are older are like,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
they lose a bit
the joie de vivre.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:90%
They lose a bit the joy of life.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So what you can learn
very simply by realizing

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that all that is in your body
and that you can reconnect

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
to it, is that you will
start to create alpha waves.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Then if you've learned how
to create these alpha waves,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
then you can realign all
the rest of your head.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, your pineal
gland, your pineal chakra,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:90%
your pituitary chakra.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.440 align:middle line:90%
You can realign everything.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And then actually, you can
open up your third eye.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You can reactivate
these beams of light.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You remember that image of
like a Buddha with the halo.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
There's always a halo
around the Buddha's head

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:84%
or Jesus where he has
this kind of-- people

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
say there's a cross
behind him in that halo,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:90%
but it's the beams of light.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what you can
learn or remember to activate.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:10%
It's very interesting

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: And then can you do
that in everyday situation?

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
How does that work
practically day-to-day,

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
or is it something you would
do during the meditation?

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: Yeah, in the beginning
you can really feel it

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's actually activating
a lot of your psychic energy.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So instead of needing
certain messages

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
going through telephones
or using that type of,

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:90%
you will be much more psychic.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:90%
So telepathic.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.870 align:middle line:90%
You will receive more.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.227 align:middle line:90%
You'll be much more sensitive.

00:27:51.227 --> 00:27:52.935 align:middle line:84%
So, in the beginning,
you get this blast.

00:27:52.935 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:90%
You are like whoa.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, the world
is opening up.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But after a while, you
will just get used to it.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:90%
It will be normal.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So in day-to-day life,
yes, it's useful.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it
will become normal.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Your normal way of being.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to--
once you have done this,

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:90%
you do this for about 14 days.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done
it, it's stable.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:20.054 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to redo this
or reactivate them again.

00:28:20.054 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Same with the marcaba.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:84%
The marcaba is your
living light body.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:26.765 align:middle line:90%
So everybody--

00:28:26.765 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Dunvalo travels in
it, in and out of space inside

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.010 align:middle line:90%
the earth.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the fourth
dimension, inside of the earth.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
He goes everywhere
in his marcaba.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So you will activate
this one time.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Once it's activated,
it becomes normal.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.155 align:middle line:90%
It's your--

00:28:42.155 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You just
travel? [ZIP SOUND]

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah, you just travel.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Where do you travel?

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: I mean, I
didn't do it yet.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I didn't just disappear.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.050 align:middle line:10%
You know, I have a
daughter to take care of.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.970 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: But staying
here but traveling.

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Because he travels all the time.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he--

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.091 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Yeah, sure.

00:28:56.091 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.465 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Having met
him and interviewed him,

00:28:58.465 --> 00:28:59.470 align:middle line:90%
he goes in the earth.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: True, yes.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
You travel inside
of your maracaba.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, your
body becomes smaller.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Like you become this
big and you travel.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you leave your
body here and you travel.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:90%
You can go and visit stuff.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You can even, if
you want proof--

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
because there's many people
who want proof in my workshops

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:10%
We do exercises and they're
like I want proof, you know.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:10%
And so what you can do is, for
example, you go into a library.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:90%
You pick a book.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You pick a page.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.440 align:middle line:90%
You go to it.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
You read it.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're back, you
take your full being, your body

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:10%
Go to the same library,
same book, same page,

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:10%
and check it out.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:10%
That's the way to check out if
you're doing the right thing

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.326 align:middle line:10%
or not.

00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:10%
If you want proof,
you'll have it.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Pretty
improvised on that one.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: If you want
proof, you'll have it.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What are some other
components or things in living

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
this day-to-day
life in the heart?

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I mean, what are some other
techniques or things that

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:10%
are important to mention here?

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.630 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: Well, it's not
even about the techniques.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Because I love this activation
of the marcaba and I

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.730 align:middle line:10%
love that part.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.495 align:middle line:10%
But what I also always
say in these workshops

00:30:16.495 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:10%
and to the students
and to myself also

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:10%
is that the most important
part is to live in the heart.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:10%
It's like, the
marcaba's like a bonus,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.760 align:middle line:10%
like this amazing
thing that can happen

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.610 align:middle line:10%
and that you will
remember anyway.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:34.870 align:middle line:10%
But the most important
is to live in your heart.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.650 align:middle line:10%
Because once you
live in your heart

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:40.700 align:middle line:10%
and you do it, really,
on a daily basis,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:10%
on a moment-to-moment basis,
reality seriously changes.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.220 align:middle line:10%
I can sometimes feel it, that
when I get angry, for example,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:10%
and somebody's screaming
at me and I am about to--

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.581 align:middle line:10%
because I'm very fiery type.

00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody screams at me,
I can feel the fire coming up.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like almost about to
respond or react basically.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:90%
And I realize, oh, no.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:84%
That little switch, that little
switch which brings me back--

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.577 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Describe right there.

00:31:10.577 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Describe what happens
from the moment you're

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
ready to react to
then things change.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: It's kind of-- I
don't know how to describe it.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.046 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you scream at me, and
I feel this fire coming out.

00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:22.170 align:middle line:90%
No, I can't do it with you.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.378 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: [PRETEND SCREAMING]

00:31:23.378 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: No, I can't
do it with you.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm just laughing.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's say somebody
else is screaming.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:10%
And I'm like getting ready
-- OK, I'm getting ready,

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:10%
I am getting ready
to scream, let's say.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.380 align:middle line:10%
Something stops me.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:10%
It's not even me.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:10%
It's my heart.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:10%
It is me.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.360 align:middle line:90%
And so the love will stop me.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And that moment, just that
little switch is the magic.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:54.015 align:middle line:10%
Because that little moment of
you can even call it awakening.

00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:10%
It's like an awakening moment.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:10%
That moment, you change reality.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:10%
Seriously.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Instead of like reacting and
getting angry and recreating

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:10%
that 3D full of old
habits and negative energy

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.480 align:middle line:10%
and low vibrations,
you actually breathe.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:10%
You know, like live
from your heart.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Respond to that situation,
and so the whole reality

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.570 align:middle line:90%
changes with you.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.360 align:middle line:90%
That person changes.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
I have often with
children, for example.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I think they see these beams
of light, a lot of children.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So they are like staring
at me, you know, like this.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And they are like
responding to that energy.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Same goes for everything.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.720 align:middle line:10%
So if you do something
from your heart,

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:10%
people are recognizing it.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:40.880 align:middle line:10%
Because everybody knows it.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Everybody knows it, even the
most severely damaged people

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:10%
in a low vibration.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:10%
They know it.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And they will feel it, and
they will respond to it.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.910 align:middle line:10%
They will even
respond so lovingly

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:10%
that it will
surprise themselves.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:10%
They'll like why am I
so nice to this person?

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: So you move
your consciousness back

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.980 align:middle line:10%
in the heart?

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.206 align:middle line:10%
And then you speak from there?

00:33:05.206 --> 00:33:07.900 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: That's basically, in
the beginning you learn it,

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
you need like a mindful.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.799 align:middle line:90%
So you close your eyes.

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.090 align:middle line:90%
You make sure there's no light.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.445 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart sees
with darkness and the eyes

00:33:17.445 --> 00:33:18.210 align:middle line:90%
see with light.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, you need
a certain setting, let's say.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
learn, it's very fast,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.550 align:middle line:84%
you learn to go in
there in a second.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And once you know your
way in, that's it.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, it's
your consciousness.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So we are all consciousness.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:90%
We're all unlimited, true.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But we can also say we
are a center of awareness.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel your
center of awareness,

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:90%
you can start to move it.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then instead of
there's people who are here

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.610 align:middle line:90%
or here or here.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.859 align:middle line:84%
So instead of like moving
outside of your body,

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:53.400 align:middle line:84%
you can say, you
know what, I'm going

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:90%
to move inside of my body.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.260 align:middle line:10%
So then you move
inside your body,

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:10%
through your throat and
you enter your heart

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.450 align:middle line:10%
and there's two spaces
there, the sacred space

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.110 align:middle line:10%
and the tiny space.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.894 align:middle line:10%
And so in the beginning,
yeah, it's a whole discovery.

00:34:07.894 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Like there's so many things.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.199 align:middle line:84%
There's the Akashic
records, for example.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:13.439 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic records
living in sacred space

00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and the tiny space.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.199 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to
discover because you,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:22.920 align:middle line:84%
your center of awareness, your
being that you are so long, so

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:84%
much time, has left
tips for you there.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be crystals or
something, or fields of light.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And you've left it
there for yourself.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.639 align:middle line:84%
It's like the original
instructions for life

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:90%
are in your heart.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:84%
So when you return there,
it feels like home.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.770 align:middle line:84%
You're like, ah,
I remember this.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:10%
Because it's true,
because you, yourself

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:10%
have left information
there for you

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.659 align:middle line:10%
to re-find when you're
here, to re-find why you're

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.409 align:middle line:10%
on this Earth,
what's your mission.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:10%
So it's a whole journey.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:10%
But as you say, afterwards,
it becomes normal again.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:10%
And then, you're
there in a second.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:10%
So if I'm out there, and
I'm responding or reacting

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:10%
on somebody's really angry at
me or just criticizing me--

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.160 align:middle line:10%
because I'm really sensitive.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Like the more that
I'm in my heart,

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.630 align:middle line:90%
the more sensitive I become.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:10%
So sometimes, somebody will look
at me and in just one second,

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:10%
I will kind of scan.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:10%
I will feel and almost hear
what this person says about me.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.172 align:middle line:10%
They will say, oh, this
girl the way-- whatever.

00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Whatever comes.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So I can sometimes attract
that and feel hurt.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm like, oh, why
does this person not

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:10%
know that I am sweet
and nice and this.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:10%
But you can also respond
to it in a different way,

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.970 align:middle line:10%
from your heart.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:10%
So then, it's much more easy.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.860 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to have
that whole technique.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.580 align:middle line:10%
It's just, I go back there
instantly and I understand.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just send
love to this person.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they are criticizing
me or projecting on me,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I can respond to them with
love and send it to them.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And say you know what,
I hope one day soon

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that I'm nice and
we'll have a nice conversation.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.980 align:middle line:90%
I wish you the same.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I wish you to live in love.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a daily thing.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I feel that
I'm angry or whatever,

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I consciously move my
consciousness back in my heart.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's a second thing.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:90%
It's like instant.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.726 align:middle line:10%
Like click, OK, I'm back.

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:37.100 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Sometimes it feels
like we need more to descend

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:10%
than ascend.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people, a
lot of spiritual people,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:90%
too, are very high up.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:10%
And we need to
take actions, too.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.370 align:middle line:10%
It's like, it's time here
to be there for this planet

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:10%
and to be there for ourselves
and to live in this heart

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:10%
and to really be instead
of just floating around.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Like really, I feel we're
called to action now.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:36:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: I agree
with you, completely.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like the more we
can earth this energy,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:84%
the more we can live it in
all the actions that we do.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
The more we can lift
this whole planet

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and really get it going,
because there's so many

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
people out there that have
no idea what's going on.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.461 align:middle line:84%
So for sure, the more
that you are ascending,

00:37:23.461 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the more that you are
awakening, the more you're

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
called to really
grounded as you say.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.750 align:middle line:84%
To really earth it, to
really take actions.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh, it's-- I
don't know the word for it.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.637 align:middle line:90%
In the Dutch, we say zvaverich.

00:37:39.637 --> 00:37:40.345 align:middle line:90%
It's like floaty.

00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:41.355 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:37:41.355 --> 00:37:44.826 align:middle line:84%
It's like pure
actions, you know.

00:37:44.826 --> 00:37:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: How do you feel
about Holland or France as part

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:10%
of their awakening, since you
spend some time here also?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: You mean the difference
between Holland and France?

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Yeah, and
around the world.

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Like because a lot of places
like I just came Avignon.

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And Avignon feels so
inspired and enlightened,

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and feel like this
is the place where

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.680 align:middle line:84%
the awakening is
going to come from.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And Mexico thinks that.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And France thinks that.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:10%
The US thinks that.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.190 align:middle line:10%
We're all very excited.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:10%
This is gonna come here.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And this is going to
transform the world.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how do you feel?

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:10%
It is really moving in France?

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.800 align:middle line:10%
Things are awakening, shifting?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:10%
Or in Holland?

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: Yes.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.310 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I feel it.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:10%
It's international wave.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:10%
I can feel it more and more.

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:10%
People that you
don't expect it from.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.220 align:middle line:10%
They will come and say
wow, I discovered this

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:10%
or I'm really into that or.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:10%
But some places more
than others, of course.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.110 align:middle line:10%
Like as you say, Avignon
maybe more than Paris,

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:49.797 align:middle line:10%
so I don't know.

00:38:49.797 --> 00:38:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: Ibiza you
said is so pretty.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.810 align:middle line:10%
Tells a about
Ibiza for a second.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.540 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: Yeah, Ibiza's amazing.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.270 align:middle line:10%
It's like the red rocks
like they are in Sedona.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.700 align:middle line:10%
So there's a lot of
magnetism in these rocks.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:10%
So if you have an
emotion there, is

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:10%
like magnified maybe 10 times.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.504 align:middle line:10%
So let's say we do--

00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:08.170 align:middle line:10%
>> LILOU: [GASP]

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:08.878 align:middle line:10%
>> HIRA: Exactly.

00:39:08.878 --> 00:39:13.970 align:middle line:10%
Let's say we do a healing here
or we do a healing in Ibiza.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.060 align:middle line:84%
For sure in Ibiza, we will get
more into the core of things.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:90%
You will let more go.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.350 align:middle line:90%
You will let more go.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.500 align:middle line:10%
How you say that?

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:10%
You will let go more.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.650 align:middle line:90%
You will let go more.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Here's a French
lady with a Dutch lady trying

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.566 align:middle line:84%
to figure out this
English thing.

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I hope you understand
everything,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.390 align:middle line:90%
my beautiful co-creators.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.328 align:middle line:84%
Everything is coming
from the heart anyway.

00:39:35.328 --> 00:39:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond the words.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:38.415 align:middle line:90%
Words, words.

00:39:38.415 --> 00:39:42.400 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: I am lucky.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I give these workshops.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And now I've given them in
nine different countries.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:10%
So I go from Israel, which is
a really beautiful country,

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:57.625 align:middle line:10%
to Ibiza to France to Amsterdam.

00:39:57.625 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Vancouver,
Belgium, Switzerland.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.822 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's
happening everywhere.

00:40:02.822 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HIRA: It's
happening everywhere.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I can feel what
happens in these workshops

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:90%
in the culture.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Some cultures, you know, I
was in Mexico for two months,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.700 align:middle line:90%
two months ago.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a totally different way.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to speak differently
to reach them than,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:24.690 align:middle line:84%
for example, another
culture or another country.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So of course, it's all the same.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's all love and
it's all light.

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's all the same.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But different cultures
have different ways

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:90%
of getting there.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.029 align:middle line:90%
So some places are beaming.

00:40:36.029 --> 00:40:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Like this, if you sit here
in the middle of Montpellier

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:84%
where they have lotus flowers,
you're sitting next to them,

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:90%
you feel them beaming.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.370 align:middle line:90%
So different countries.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think the
world is really waking up.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not that I think.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.361 align:middle line:84%
I feel and I know that
the world is waking up.

00:40:54.361 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:90%

00:41:15.784 --> 00:41:17.922 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting you on the spot?

>> HIRA: Yeah, you do

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.001 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What is your
heart telling you, my God?

00:41:21.001 --> 00:41:22.965 align:middle line:90%


00:41:22.965 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> HIRA: Well, be it.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.942 align:middle line:10%
Be love.

00:41:24.942 --> 00:41:25.790 align:middle line:10%
Be love.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:84%
