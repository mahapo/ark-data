>> Lilou: Hello my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.816 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Santa Barbara today
with delicious Jack Canfield.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:16.517 align:middle line:90%
Hello!

00:00:16.517 --> 00:00:17.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Jack Canfield: Hi!

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.119 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Laughing]
I'm coming all the way

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.355 align:middle line:90%
from France to interview you.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.693 align:middle line:84%
I'm very thrilled, of course,
your name resonates loudly in me

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:28.195 align:middle line:84%
because of all the work you
have done and all the books

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.498 align:middle line:84%
that I have read, so
it's very much an honor

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.066 align:middle line:90%
to be interviewing you today.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.468 align:middle line:84%
I have so many questions,
and I'm sure a lot

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:37.771 align:middle line:84%
of the people watching right
now on Gaiam are thrilled

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.108 align:middle line:84%
to hear you once again, because
of the clarity of your thoughts

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
and your way of communicating,
I think it's great.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.545 align:middle line:90%
It goes straight to the point.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.412 align:middle line:90%
I love it, thank you!

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.213 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.014 align:middle line:90%
>> Jack Canfield: Thank you!

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.415 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure to be with you.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.583 align:middle line:84%
I should say merci beaucoup for
coming all the way from France!

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Nice!

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:54.288 align:middle line:84%
So you're the - this, everybody
knows you from the Chicken Soup

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.757 align:middle line:84%
of the Soul, of course, and
that was a huge success.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:84%
We know you also from The
Secret and Power Focus,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.663 align:middle line:90%
and many other wonderful books.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:05.065 align:middle line:84%
You speak a lot of success,
right, that's really something

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.567 align:middle line:90%
of maximizing your potential.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:07.568 align:middle line:90%
Is that really at the core

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.436 align:middle line:84%
of what you've always
been teaching?

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:11.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack Canfield: Well, my
life purpose as I say is

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:13.174 align:middle line:84%
to inspire people
and empower people

00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:15.909 align:middle line:84%
to live their highest vision
in the context of love and joy,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.046 align:middle line:84%
so we inspire with stories
like the Chicken Soup

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.048 align:middle line:84%
for The Soul books, and we
empower through the tools

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.149 align:middle line:90%
that I do with my seminars,

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.118 align:middle line:84%
and books like The
Success Principles,

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:26.387 align:middle line:84%
and The Aladdin Factor,
and The Power Focus.

00:01:26.387 --> 00:01:27.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.756 align:middle line:90%
So how do you see success?

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.324 align:middle line:90%
How do you define success?

00:01:30.324 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack Canfield: I used to
define success as being able

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.861 align:middle line:84%
to produce any result
you wanted,

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.564 align:middle line:84%
whether it was good health,
great relationship, whatever,

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:38.132 align:middle line:84%
but recently I've
been defining it

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:39.599 align:middle line:84%
as fulfilling your
soul's purpose.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.068 align:middle line:84%
If you come here and
you make a lot of money,

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
but you don't fulfill
your soul's purpose,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.272 align:middle line:84%
it's like you went to France
to see the Eiffel Tower

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.706 align:middle line:84%
and you never got
there, you know?

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:50.843 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I really think that
we all are born with a purpose,

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:55.349 align:middle line:84%
and that our job, if you will,
our joy is to discover what

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
that purpose is, and then
find ways to manifest it,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.188 align:middle line:84%
through our work,
through our relationships,

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:03.057 align:middle line:90%
and through anything else we do.

00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:05.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: When did that shifted
for you to start speaking

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:08.027 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and life
purpose on that level?

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:12.233 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember you speaking
very much into goals and to -

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.568 align:middle line:90%
or is that still actual for you?

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Are you - have really
shifted to - ?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack Canfield: No, I'm
still a big believer in goals,

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:21.342 align:middle line:84%
but I think the goals need to
be aligned with your purpose,

00:02:21.342 --> 00:02:26.413 align:middle line:84%
that...that this purpose is
inside of us, this destiny,

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:28.649 align:middle line:84%
these lessons we're here to
learn, these things we're meant

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.453 align:middle line:84%
to express, the sources
we're meant to deliver,

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:35.823 align:middle line:84%
the talents we're meant
to develop and express

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.225 align:middle line:90%
in the world, and I would say

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.895 align:middle line:84%
about maybe five years ago I
began to change that definition.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.731 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been doing Chicken
Soup for The Soul since 1993,

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:47.034 align:middle line:84%
so we just celebrated
the 20th anniversary

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of the first Chicken
Soup for The Soul book.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.207 align:middle line:84%
But this definition of
success I think really shifted.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:55.643 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you why, I
don't remember the event,

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:59.113 align:middle line:84%
but it just became clear
to me that we have -

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:03.651 align:middle line:84%
that's what we're here to do
- to fulfill that purpose.

00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:05.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Is that directly related to also
helping the world and assisting,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.359 align:middle line:90%
you know, in humanity or is it -

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.562 align:middle line:84%
can we live our soul purpose
solely for us or is it linked

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
to something else more
related to humanity?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well what I've found
is that when you are engaged

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.372 align:middle line:84%
in activities that bring you
great joy, that light you up,

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.875 align:middle line:84%
that make you feel
excited and expansive,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.111 align:middle line:84%
it may look to someone like
you're just doing it for you,

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is, when
you're doing that,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.014 align:middle line:84%
you're actually being
of service.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I love
to teach and write.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.519 align:middle line:84%
Someone else may love
to fix automobiles,

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.586 align:middle line:84%
but we need our automobiles
fixed, you know?

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:42.723 align:middle line:84%
And so we need mechanics
on the airlines.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:45.559 align:middle line:84%
Thank God there are people
who love to do that [laughing]

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and you know, clean homes and
grow gardens and grow food

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.432 align:middle line:90%
and be artists and architects.

00:03:51.432 --> 00:03:54.501 align:middle line:90%
So I always say that, you know,

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.104 align:middle line:84%
joy is our inborn
guidance system

00:03:57.104 --> 00:04:00.007 align:middle line:84%
that tells us we're
on track, on purpose.

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:03.277 align:middle line:84%
And so one of my friends, I
think it was Martin Luther King

00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:05.112 align:middle line:84%
who might have said it,
I'm not sure exactly,

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:07.648 align:middle line:84%
but my friend told me
this recently, he said,

00:04:07.648 --> 00:04:10.551 align:middle line:84%
"Don't ask what the world
needs, ask what lights you up,

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:13.153 align:middle line:84%
because the world needs
people who are lit up,"

00:04:13.153 --> 00:04:14.688 align:middle line:84%
meaning people are
doing the things

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.423 align:middle line:84%
that bring them the
greatest joy.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:19.526 align:middle line:84%
And I think that many, many
people's greatest joy is to be

00:04:19.526 --> 00:04:22.663 align:middle line:84%
of service and that
when you are, you know,

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:26.033 align:middle line:84%
like my wife would probably most
people would say she's living a

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.736 align:middle line:84%
very charmed life, you know,
she doesn't have a job for money

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:30.938 align:middle line:84%
out in the world,
but she is someone

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.573 align:middle line:90%
who I call a "day maker."

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.541 align:middle line:84%
If you were to meet her and
talk to her, you'd leave and go,

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.876 align:middle line:90%
"Wow, she made my day!"

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.479 align:middle line:84%
So even when she's just talking
to her family and friends

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.248 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, she's being of
service, even though it looks

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:42.783 align:middle line:84%
like she's just having
a good time.

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:47.121 align:middle line:84%
So I think the key is find that
thing that makes you come alive,

00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.489 align:middle line:90%
that gives you the greatest joy.

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.425 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
will naturally be of service.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:54.862 align:middle line:84%
And some of us are meant
to be out there, you know,

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:58.365 align:middle line:84%
ending homelessness, fulfilling
you know getting people

00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:02.336 align:middle line:84%
to have more food available,
and being on social injustice

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:05.439 align:middle line:84%
in the world, greening
the planet and so forth.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.641 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that's
everyone that has to be involved

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.009 align:middle line:90%
in that in a heavy way.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.677 align:middle line:84%
They want to do things that
don't destroy the environment,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.614 align:middle line:84%
that aren't unfriendly and
unfair, but not everybody has

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to be out on a picket line
or you know doing legal work

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.319 align:middle line:84%
in the courts to get
people out of jail

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.255 align:middle line:84%
that should never have been
there in the first place.

00:05:21.255 --> 00:05:22.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.292 align:middle line:84%
Is that ultimately linked to
having the money to do that?

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
struggle to find the money

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:29.863 align:middle line:84%
so that they can live
their life purpose,

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.366 align:middle line:90%
and often it's an excuse?

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.234 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: I don't think you
have to have a lot of money

00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:35.269 align:middle line:90%
to live your life purpose.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:37.304 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think having
money is useful.

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:40.674 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly allowed me to
live my life purpose more fully.

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.543 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're sitting in
my home in Santa Barbara,

00:05:42.543 --> 00:05:45.879 align:middle line:84%
it's a 6,000 square feet, our
offices are on the property,

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.149 align:middle line:84%
I have 12 staff, you know, I can
pretty much get anything I need

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.619 align:middle line:84%
to do the things I want to do,
but I was fulfilling my purpose

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:53.821 align:middle line:90%
when I was a high school teacher

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:56.657 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago making
8,000 dollars a year.

00:05:56.657 --> 00:05:58.192 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was inspiring
and empowering people

00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.126 align:middle line:90%
to live their life's vision.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:01.195 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's an
excuse to say,

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:02.329 align:middle line:90%
"Well I don't have the money."

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.264 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can find
a way within the sphere

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:05.399 align:middle line:90%
of influence you have

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.534 align:middle line:84%
to actually do the thing
you were meant to do.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.837 align:middle line:84%
We see - you know,
whenever I go to New York,

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.706 align:middle line:84%
and I see Puerto Rican or black
kids will be out in the park

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle line:84%
and they've got old
paint cans, you know,

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.243 align:middle line:84%
these big five-gallon
white drums,

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:17.845 align:middle line:84%
and they're playing
drums on them.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:19.813 align:middle line:84%
And then they might
have spent seven dollars

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.448 align:middle line:84%
for the drumsticks,
but the drums,

00:06:21.448 --> 00:06:24.818 align:middle line:84%
they probably just got an old,
you know, construction site.

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:84%
People that make these wonderful
instruments out of the oil cans

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.857 align:middle line:90%
in Jamaica and Trinidad.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:32.892 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you can make music
wherever you are, you don't have

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.161 align:middle line:90%
to have a grand piano.

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:35.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:06:35.496 --> 00:06:38.565 align:middle line:84%
I remember you telling the
story in the movie The Secret

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:43.437 align:middle line:84%
about how you really wanted
to have your dreams come true.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:45.405 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about that
process and is it -

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:47.474 align:middle line:84%
are you still very much
- because I was there

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
in the audience the day
you were on the Oprah show,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.247 align:middle line:84%
and that famous day was really
shifting and it was beautiful,

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:54.915 align:middle line:90%
you could feel it in the air.

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:59.186 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very much intrigued as
to how that, this whole law

00:06:59.186 --> 00:07:01.488 align:middle line:84%
of attraction and The
Secret have evolved for you

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:02.723 align:middle line:90%
and we can go later in that,

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.358 align:middle line:84%
but I know you have
a very special story,

00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:05.859 align:middle line:90%
maybe you can tell us that?

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:06.927 align:middle line:90%
Many people have heard it,

00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.696 align:middle line:84%
but with that build,
you know, the money?

00:07:09.696 --> 00:07:11.365 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Yeah, well early

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:13.367 align:middle line:84%
on I had a mentor
named W. Clement Stone,

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:15.302 align:middle line:84%
it was a good friend
Napoleon Hill who wrote Think

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.504 align:middle line:84%
and Grow Rich, and they
taught that, you know,

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.774 align:middle line:84%
if you have a goal, you need
to believe in it, affirm it,

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
visualize it, and
then feel the feelings

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:84%
as if it were already true, and
so based on that, I was working

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.782 align:middle line:84%
with Stone at the
time, and he said,

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.318 align:middle line:84%
"I want you to set a goal that's
so big, that if you achieve it,

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:33.287 align:middle line:84%
you'll know it's only because
of what I've taught you

00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:34.788 align:middle line:90%
that you accomplished it."

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:37.024 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
making 8,000 dollars a year

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.725 align:middle line:90%
as a teacher in Chicago.

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:84%
And so, I said, "Okay,
my goal is

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.629 align:middle line:84%
to make 100,000 dollars
in one year."

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.431 align:middle line:84%
And that just seemed like me
sitting here saying I'm going

00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:46.233 align:middle line:90%
to be a billionaire next year.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:49.503 align:middle line:84%
And so I said "But I'm going
to do everything you say."

00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:51.972 align:middle line:84%
So I went home and I
wrote the affirmation,

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.841 align:middle line:84%
"God is my unlimited supply
in large sums of money,

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:57.144 align:middle line:84%
come to me quickly and easily,
and through the grace of God

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.113 align:middle line:84%
as I easily and effortlessly
earn and invest

00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:01.281 align:middle line:90%
and spend 100,000 a year."

00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.116 align:middle line:90%
That was my affirmation.

00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:06.486 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a visualization
where I'd close my eyes,

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.856 align:middle line:84%
and I'd see my 100,000
lifestyle.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.858 align:middle line:84%
And back then it was going
to be like, you know,

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:14.695 align:middle line:84%
Native American rugs on the
wall, which I wanted to collect

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:90%
at the time, living on a lake,

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:17.931 align:middle line:84%
and having a certain
car and so forth.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.101 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, "Well, I
should have an external thing,"

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:25.572 align:middle line:84%
so I created a 100,000 bill, and
it was about this big and about

00:08:25.572 --> 00:08:27.407 align:middle line:90%
that tall out of green paper,

00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.876 align:middle line:84%
and I then just took an overhead
projector and projected it

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.512 align:middle line:84%
onto the one-dollar bill, traced
it, and then added a bunch

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.916 align:middle line:84%
of zeroes, and I put that
on the ceiling above my bed,

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
so every morning I'd wake up

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.019 align:middle line:84%
and first thing I'd see was
the 100,000 dollar bill,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.455 align:middle line:84%
which reminded me to go
inside and visualize.

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:45.592 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was I
remember I did that every day

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:49.263 align:middle line:84%
for about 30 days, and then
somewhere in that fourth

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or fifth week, I was
in the shower and all

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.068 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden I had this
100,000 dollar idea.

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle line:84%
I had never had a 100,000
dollar idea before.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:09:01.675 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a book at that
time called "100 Ways

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle line:84%
to Enhance Self-Concept
in the Classroom."

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.879 align:middle line:84%
And every time that book
got sold, I made 25 cents.

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:90%
That was my half of the royalty,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle line:84%
it was co-authored
with another guy.

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:10.751 align:middle line:84%
Book sold for 6.95,
if you can remember

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:12.252 align:middle line:90%
when books were that cheap.

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:15.122 align:middle line:84%
And so [laughing], and
so I thought "Okay,

00:09:15.122 --> 00:09:17.357 align:middle line:84%
if I can sell 400,000
copies of this book,

00:09:17.357 --> 00:09:19.259 align:middle line:90%
I'd have 100,000 dollars."

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:21.228 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to do that,
I'd never done it before,

00:09:21.228 --> 00:09:23.463 align:middle line:84%
but that was the first time
I had a leveragable idea

00:09:23.463 --> 00:09:24.731 align:middle line:90%
that actually seemed real.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:28.001 align:middle line:84%
So then I started visualizing
selling that many books.

00:09:28.001 --> 00:09:29.336 align:middle line:90%
That was my next visualization.

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:33.206 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to see
things I'd never seen before.

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:34.775 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the law
of attraction starts

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.443 align:middle line:84%
to bring things into
your consciousness,

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
the reticular activating
system in your brain opens up,

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.881 align:middle line:84%
and you see things
that were always there.

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:42.683 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, you're not
aware of what you're feeling

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:44.151 align:middle line:84%
in your right foot,
but as soon as I say

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:44.885 align:middle line:84%
"right foot," you
feel it, right?

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:47.621 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well that information
is streaming up your leg,

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.289 align:middle line:84%
into the lower part
of your brain,

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.458 align:middle line:84%
into what they call the
reticular activating system,

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:53.994 align:middle line:84%
and was being filtered
out, it was not important.

00:09:53.994 --> 00:09:57.964 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in my grandmother's
bathroom, and I see something

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that was always there,
but I never saw

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.501 align:middle line:90%
because it wasn't relevant.

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
My reticular system
hadn't opened to it.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.907 align:middle line:84%
It was a Reader's Digest,
and it said something

00:10:06.907 --> 00:10:09.409 align:middle line:84%
like 8 million readers
monthly in 17 languages.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:10.944 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Wow, if
8 million readers knew

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle line:84%
about my book, certainly
400,000 people would buy it."

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and I called
up Reader's Digest, and I said,

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.351 align:middle line:84%
"What does it cost
to take out an ad?"

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.454 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Well what
are you advertising?"

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:23.256 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, and they
said it should be one page ad,

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:26.593 align:middle line:84%
it should be six months in a row
so people see it over and over

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:29.896 align:middle line:84%
and get used to it, and
you let us write the copy

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle line:84%
and it should be full
color and all this.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.033 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well what
would that cost me?"

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a little
calculator in the background,

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:36.269 align:middle line:84%
adding machine before
calculators, you know,

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.972 align:middle line:84%
that we have now, and it's going
tsk-tsk-tsk [assumed spelling],"

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.941 align:middle line:84%
and it came out to
108,000 dollars.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:43.443 align:middle line:84%
And I said "I won't be doing
that," and they said "Why not?"

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.912 align:middle line:84%
and I said, "Well number one,
I don't have 108,000 dollars,

00:10:45.912 --> 00:10:47.514 align:middle line:84%
and number two, the
game I'm playing,

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:50.684 align:middle line:84%
I end up minus 8,000 dollars,
it doesn't really work."

00:10:50.684 --> 00:10:55.555 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife, then, saw
another one of these things,

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:58.525 align:middle line:84%
it was a resource, and
she said, "You know?

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.727 align:middle line:84%
Reader's Digest has
something in it besides ads.

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:01.561 align:middle line:90%
There's articles.

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:02.562 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you write an article?"

00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:04.197 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote an article,
I sent that off

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.299 align:middle line:84%
to Reader's Digest,
it got rejected.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But then I saw another resource,
I'm at the supermarket,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.505 align:middle line:90%
it said "National Inquirer,"

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:14.441 align:middle line:84%
which is a newspaper they sell
here, it's kind of a, you know,

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:17.177 align:middle line:90%
sensational rag they call them,

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:19.646 align:middle line:84%
and but they had 12 million
readers a week and I thought,

00:11:19.646 --> 00:11:21.281 align:middle line:84%
"Whoa, 12 million readers
a week that's better

00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:23.083 align:middle line:84%
than Reader's Digest,"
so I called them up,

00:11:23.083 --> 00:11:26.386 align:middle line:84%
ad rates were still ridiculous,
but I started visualizing myself

00:11:26.386 --> 00:11:28.588 align:middle line:84%
in the Reader's Digest
and the National Inquirer.

00:11:28.588 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
That became my new
visualization.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.858 align:middle line:84%
Now we're about three
or four months

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.393 align:middle line:90%
into the year at this point.

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I'm
doing a talk down in New York

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.066 align:middle line:84%
for Hunter College, I was
teaching teachers at the time.

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:84%
600 people showed up
for this workshop.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.971 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of it, this
woman came up and she said,

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.439 align:middle line:90%
"I'd like to interview you."

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:48.475 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Great, who
do you write for?"

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:50.677 align:middle line:84%
She said, "The National
Inquirer."

00:11:50.677 --> 00:11:53.747 align:middle line:84%
I went, "do-do-do-do"
[Laughing] Amazing!

00:11:53.747 --> 00:11:56.449 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that article got
published, and a whole lot

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.586 align:middle line:84%
of books got sold, and then
we saw one other resource came

00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:01.188 align:middle line:90%
into our awareness.

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
When we sold that book,
every book I got a quarter.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.827 align:middle line:84%
And my wife said, "You know,
if we were a bookstore,

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.328 align:middle line:84%
when we sell the book,
we'd make three dollars,

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.996 align:middle line:84%
because that's the retail
market, now you only have

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:13.466 align:middle line:84%
to sell 33,000 books,
not you know 400,000."

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:15.468 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, "Whoa, okay."

00:12:15.468 --> 00:12:17.904 align:middle line:84%
So now, we started the
mail order bookstore,

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.674 align:middle line:84%
we started sending out,
picking you know small ads

00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in like family newspapers
and magazines and things,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.445 align:middle line:84%
and we started selling
a lot of books,

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.248 align:middle line:84%
and then we saw another
resource which was Wow.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.083 align:middle line:84%
They've already proven
they'll buy a self-esteem book,

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.452 align:middle line:84%
what if we had a catalogue of
other self-esteem activities

00:12:32.452 --> 00:12:34.087 align:middle line:90%
and books and tapes and CDs?

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:90%
So long story short, we end

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:38.558 align:middle line:84%
up with an eight page
catalogue, 32 items in it.

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.161 align:middle line:84%
We start taking this bookstore
on the road to conferences.

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.364 align:middle line:84%
We're averaging about 2,000
dollars a week in profits,

00:12:44.364 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
so we now have 100,000
dollar a year business,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.468 align:middle line:84%
and there were some other
things that occurred.

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:52.739 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of the year,
we had made 92,328 dollars.

00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:54.441 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't make
100 - but my wife

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and I were not sitting there
going, "Oh, what a bummer,

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.345 align:middle line:84%
we didn't reach our
goal," we went, "Wow!

00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.713 align:middle line:90%
This really works!"

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:01.381 align:middle line:84%
And my wife said, "Do you think
it will work for a million?"

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, it worked
for 100,000, let's do that."

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.886 align:middle line:90%
So we got a million dollar bill,

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:07.554 align:middle line:84%
put that on the ceiling,
and it was -

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:08.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Which year was that?

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.689 align:middle line:90%
When was that?

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:12.158 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: This was now
around - well the first year

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
when all this happened
was in the early 1970s.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.199 align:middle line:90%
And then by 19...uh, I think 93?

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:20.901 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was
a few years later,

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.502 align:middle line:84%
but we had this vision
constantly.

00:13:22.502 --> 00:13:24.404 align:middle line:84%
I got my first million
dollar check.

00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:30.543 align:middle line:84%
It was for 1,130,325.38
if I remember correctly,

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.913 align:middle line:84%
and the next year,
we got four of those.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:34.915 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a year where
we made 12 million dollars.

00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:37.584 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's just like
it didn't happen overnight,

00:13:37.584 --> 00:13:39.252 align:middle line:84%
but that visualization,
it did the first year,

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:41.655 align:middle line:84%
but then the visualization
just kept driving and driving

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:43.089 align:middle line:90%
and driving, and now, you know,

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:45.225 align:middle line:84%
I always make several million
dollars a year or more.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:46.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:49.296 align:middle line:84%
So I remember The Secret
and The Law of Attraction,

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:50.931 align:middle line:84%
and you being part
of the transformation

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.934 align:middle line:84%
or leadership council,
having started that.

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
How did that whole Law
of Attraction evolve

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.705 align:middle line:90%
for you since that movie?

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.974 align:middle line:90%
What was your experience of it?

00:14:00.974 --> 00:14:01.942 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well I had
been living The Law

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of Attraction and teaching it.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.578 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I was calling it
The Law of Attraction so much

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:08.248 align:middle line:84%
as calling it positive
thinking and things like that.

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:12.152 align:middle line:84%
And then when Rhonda Byrne made
The Secret and invited me in

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the people from
the Transformational Leadership

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.723 align:middle line:84%
Council to be in that movie,
in fact, they filmed, I think,

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
13 of us at one of our
meetings in Colorado.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.529 align:middle line:84%
Then it really, that
took off and kind

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.331 align:middle line:84%
of re-vectored my
career for a few years,

00:14:24.331 --> 00:14:26.366 align:middle line:84%
because I spent the
majority of my time going

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:30.003 align:middle line:84%
to Secret conferences, they'd
have like five or six of us,

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
Bob Proctor and me and Lisa
Nichols and Marci Shimoff

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.742 align:middle line:84%
and all speaking, and
I got to travel all

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
over the world doing that.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.145 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book called Jack
Canfield's Key to Living Law

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of Attraction, which
did very well.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.751 align:middle line:84%
And I made friends with a lot
of people I only knew about,

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:46.686 align:middle line:84%
like Joe Vitali, and
people like that.

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:50.123 align:middle line:84%
So it was a great, great
forward movement for me

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:84%
in my career, and
impacting people.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.429 align:middle line:84%
But I think also the thing
that I've been doing also -

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:59.699 align:middle line:84%
The Secret, it talks
about action, it doesn't -

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
not saying you don't
need to do that,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.168 align:middle line:90%
but doesn't stress it enough.

00:15:02.168 --> 00:15:04.971 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think, "I
just need to sit in my room,

00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:07.207 align:middle line:84%
visualize a Mercedes, and
somehow one's going to drive

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.942 align:middle line:84%
up into my driveway and
someone will knock on my door

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:10.343 align:middle line:90%
and hand me the keys."

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.246 align:middle line:84%
That could happen,
but it's unlikely.

00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:15.515 align:middle line:84%
You have to go do
things that produce cars,

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:19.052 align:middle line:84%
like maybe get a job or you
know, work, you can get ideas.

00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:90%
You can get resources.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.821 align:middle line:90%
You'll get possibilities.

00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:24.357 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I once had a guy going
to Europe for a year, he said,

00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to Europe, and I
have this Audi, I don't want it

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.662 align:middle line:84%
to just sit here, would you
drive it for me for a year?"

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:31.231 align:middle line:84%
I went, "Sure," so
that could happen.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:32.766 align:middle line:84%
But it was only for a year,
and then he wanted it back.

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:34.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I have this
thing for a Porsche.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.002 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Huh?

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Back then, when I was
practicing, I was living back

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.439 align:middle line:84%
in Miami, and somebody handed
me a Porsche for two months.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.508 align:middle line:84%
I barely knew that
person, I'm like, "Okay!"

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:42.609 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:43.843 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well maybe
it's only Porsche/Audi,

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:45.745 align:middle line:84%
since it's basically the
same company that does that.

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
But no, seriously, I think that
you start - once you visualize

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.686 align:middle line:84%
and affirm and desire, and you
know, get your vibration up

00:15:53.686 --> 00:15:56.923 align:middle line:84%
and do the ask, believe,
receive that The Secret teaches,

00:15:56.923 --> 00:15:59.526 align:middle line:84%
part of - this was something
Marcia Wieder taught me,

00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
really valuable.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.497 align:middle line:84%
She said, "Part of
believing is taking action.

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:90%
It demonstrates your belief.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe that this is
going to work, so I'm going

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.768 align:middle line:90%
to take action on it."

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:10.503 align:middle line:84%
I always, since she
shared that with me,

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:13.406 align:middle line:84%
I came up with my own metaphor,
which is, if I was sitting here

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:15.508 align:middle line:84%
and telling people that I was
going to run a seminar tonight

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:17.877 align:middle line:84%
on levitation, and I'll
teach everyone to levitate

00:16:17.877 --> 00:16:20.947 align:middle line:84%
for six feet off the
ground for ten minutes,

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:22.882 align:middle line:90%
most people wouldn't sign up.

00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:24.651 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they wouldn't
is they've never seen

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:25.585 align:middle line:90%
anyone levitate.

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
They've seen a few
people bouncing

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.321 align:middle line:84%
around on Fairfield
Highway, you know,

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:32.158 align:middle line:84%
but no one's ever levitated for
six feet for six minutes, um,

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.461 align:middle line:84%
there's no belief that I
could actually do that.

00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:36.196 align:middle line:90%
So why would they sign up?

00:16:36.196 --> 00:16:38.665 align:middle line:84%
So we don't take action on
things we don't believe.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.568 align:middle line:84%
So if we do take action
on a belief, you know,

00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
that I can find my ideal mate,
or I can have my ideal job,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.106 align:middle line:84%
or I am going to make a
million dollars, or I'm going

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:47.773 align:middle line:90%
to end hunger in my county,

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:50.643 align:middle line:84%
then when I start taking action
it's telling the universe, "Hey,

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:51.978 align:middle line:90%
he believes this is possible"

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:53.346 align:middle line:84%
and that brings the
vibration up,

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.316 align:middle line:84%
it actually accelerates the Law
of Attraction in my opinion.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Mmm, the
vibration it's important

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:01.321 align:middle line:90%
to stay, to keep it high?

00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:02.856 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yes, it's
important, you know,

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:06.725 align:middle line:84%
basically I think
Abraham talks about this

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:08.495 align:middle line:84%
and when Esther Hicks
channels that,

00:17:08.495 --> 00:17:14.399 align:middle line:84%
that you have this conveyor
belt that's bringing you things

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.668 align:middle line:84%
that you've wanted, that
you've desired, you've said,

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:19.004 align:middle line:84%
"Okay Universe, this is
what I want," but then it's

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:20.807 align:middle line:84%
like having this
big, big box coming

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:23.475 align:middle line:84%
and a very small mailbox,
it just can't fit in.

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when we are in a state of
gratitude, when we're in a state

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.249 align:middle line:84%
of love, when we're in a state
of joy, when we're in a state

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:33.019 align:middle line:84%
of excitement, when we're in
a state of forgiveness, then,

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:36.623 align:middle line:84%
and we're not judging, because
I think judging or anger or any

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of that is a lower vibration,
and so we will attract things

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.429 align:middle line:84%
to us, our mailbox will be
big enough to receive things

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:46.232 align:middle line:84%
that fit into that
level of vibration.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:49.836 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm in a state of love
and joy and you know, gratitude

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:51.938 align:middle line:84%
and all that, it's
very expansive,

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:53.239 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of things can come in.

00:17:53.239 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I love the
metaphor that Esther Hicks uses,

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.746 align:middle line:84%
is where you've got this
conveyor belt with all kinds

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.182 align:middle line:84%
of stuff backed up
that can't get in,

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
until you raise your vibration.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.756 align:middle line:84%
And I think too that we
need to raise our vibration

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:12.258 align:middle line:84%
and it's not, again, just
you know that someone's going

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.494 align:middle line:84%
to plop a car in our
driveway, but we're going

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.964 align:middle line:84%
to start attracting the kinds
of people, like your friend

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:20.133 align:middle line:84%
who had a Porsche, my
friend who had an Audi,

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:22.035 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to someone
driving an old Chevrolet

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:24.637 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have the higher
vibration of abundance

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.072 align:middle line:84%
and prosperity in their
life at that time.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:28.374 align:middle line:90%
So vibration is critical.

00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.476 align:middle line:90%
And I think through meditation,

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:33.913 align:middle line:84%
through you know
gratitude processes,

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:37.784 align:middle line:84%
through...I teach people, make
a list of 25 things you love

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.553 align:middle line:84%
to do, then every day spend
at least an hour doing one

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.255 align:middle line:84%
of those things, because when
you're doing something you love

00:18:42.255 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:90%
to do, you feel good.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.793 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another way
to raise your vibration up.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: One of the things
I remember way back then

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.663 align:middle line:84%
that really was, that
got stuck in my mind,

00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:52.932 align:middle line:84%
is being 100 percent
responsible for our life.

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.033 align:middle line:90%
Like, isn't that one

00:18:54.033 --> 00:18:56.669 align:middle line:84%
of the first big steps
before any of this?

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.371 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, in my book
The Success Principles,

00:18:58.371 --> 00:19:01.107 align:middle line:84%
I say the first chapter is
take 100 percent responsibility

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:84%
for your life, for your
results, because if you don't,

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.678 align:middle line:84%
then you're thinking
someone else is responsible,

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:07.413 align:middle line:84%
and then you're blaming
them when it doesn't work,

00:19:07.413 --> 00:19:10.683 align:middle line:84%
you're complaining about what
doesn't work, and blaming

00:19:10.683 --> 00:19:13.119 align:middle line:84%
and complaining are lower
vibrations, for starters,

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:16.122 align:middle line:84%
plus they create the
belief inside of you

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:18.424 align:middle line:84%
that someone else is
responsible for my happiness,

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:21.361 align:middle line:84%
for my fulfillment, for my
success, and it's not true.

00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.797 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, we are
100 percent responsible.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I just went to a talk last
night with Eben Alexander,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.235 align:middle line:90%
who wrote Proof of Heaven.

00:19:29.235 --> 00:19:30.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Inaudible]
a few months ago

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.605 align:middle line:90%
in Marseille in France.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:33.306 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Oh really.

00:19:33.306 --> 00:19:34.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Lovely man.

00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:35.074 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: He's getting
around [laughing].

00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:35.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes, oh yes.

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:37.043 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: He's a very lovely guy.

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:39.045 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying that
same thing, you know,

00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:41.114 align:middle line:84%
that basically whatever's
going on around us,

00:19:41.114 --> 00:19:45.184 align:middle line:84%
we're the one who's creating
it, you know, and so we see

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
that message coming from
every ancient tradition,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:84%
from modern psychology, from
quantum physics, from the law

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:53.359 align:middle line:84%
of attraction, and so
it's just time to get

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:55.194 align:middle line:84%
that if your life isn't
what you want it to be,

00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.196 align:middle line:84%
the only constant
variable is you.

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:19:59.465 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: You know, someone
said you can't escape yourself,

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.234 align:middle line:84%
wherever you go,
you take yourself.

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:04.504 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, people keep
re-creating the same experience

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:05.838 align:middle line:90%
over and over.

00:20:05.838 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
People - I know people who
have been married five times,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.009 align:middle line:84%
and gotten divorced, and every
time they think it's the wife's

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:84%
fault, because they keep
marrying the same kind

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
of person, they keep being
the same kind of person,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.816 align:middle line:84%
they don't grow and change,
nothing's going to shift.

00:20:16.816 --> 00:20:20.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Mm, some people
blame God or the universe

00:20:20.653 --> 00:20:22.021 align:middle line:90%
for not having those things.

00:20:22.021 --> 00:20:26.626 align:middle line:84%
What is, and I hear we have
to be 100 percent responsible

00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:28.594 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, so what
is the right balance

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:90%
between us being responsible,

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.665 align:middle line:84%
and us also being
confident enough

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:84%
in having this great
relationship too

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.103 align:middle line:90%
with the universe and God?

00:20:37.103 --> 00:20:38.938 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well, I think
you know your relationship

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:90%
with God is probably a mirror

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.175 align:middle line:84%
of your relationship
to everyone else.

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:44.143 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you think other
people are responsible,

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:46.145 align:middle line:84%
you think God did
it to you, you know?

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:90%
I love Michael Beckwith,

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.816 align:middle line:84%
he teaches these four
stages of spiritual growth.

00:20:49.816 --> 00:20:52.685 align:middle line:84%
He says the first stage
is victim - "Oh God,

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:53.986 align:middle line:90%
why'd you do it to me?"

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.823 align:middle line:84%
You know? And the next stage
is he calls manipulation,

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:58.725 align:middle line:84%
where you learn that there
are some laws in the universe

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:01.527 align:middle line:84%
and you can manipulate those
laws to get what you want.

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:03.296 align:middle line:84%
That's where a lot of -
like the law of attraction -

00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:05.064 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of people
are with that.

00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:07.367 align:middle line:84%
And the third stage is
where you realize you are -

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:10.336 align:middle line:84%
for all these laws, there
must be a law maker,

00:21:10.336 --> 00:21:12.839 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
predictable and dependable

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:16.876 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, and then you
begin to go, "Oh, maybe I need

00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:19.512 align:middle line:84%
to surrender to that which
is brighter than I am,"

00:21:19.512 --> 00:21:22.115 align:middle line:84%
or tells you more powerful
or more awesome than I am,

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:25.318 align:middle line:84%
and so you become a channel
for God, then it's not my will

00:21:25.318 --> 00:21:28.187 align:middle line:84%
but thy will, and then
ultimately you realize, "Wait,

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:30.256 align:middle line:84%
you're not a channel
for God, you are God.

00:21:30.256 --> 00:21:32.759 align:middle line:84%
You're not all of God, anymore
than one drop of water is all

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean, but the
ocean isn't separate

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.563 align:middle line:84%
from the ocean any more than
we're separate from God,"

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and you know, I think
Einstein said,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.301 align:middle line:84%
one of the great physicists
of all time, he says,

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.872 align:middle line:84%
"If you are thinking that you're
separate from everything else,

00:21:45.872 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
you're living under
the grand delusion,"

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.909 align:middle line:84%
he didn't say illusion,
he said delusion.

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:53.579 align:middle line:84%
Like it's a mental
illness, and so I tend

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:56.182 align:middle line:84%
to be what I call an inverse
paranoid, that I believe

00:21:56.182 --> 00:21:58.451 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
plotting to do me well,

00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:00.686 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the universe
is plotting to do me bad.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:04.791 align:middle line:84%
So it's not "Why me, Oh
God," it's like, "Oh, God!

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:06.726 align:middle line:84%
Why me? Why do I get
all this good stuff?"

00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.428 align:middle line:90%
It's a total different shift.

00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:11.564 align:middle line:84%
So I think when people
are blaming God,

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:14.167 align:middle line:84%
it's probably a projection of
them blaming their parents,

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.203 align:middle line:84%
because we often talk about God
the Father, and I think people,

00:22:17.203 --> 00:22:20.106 align:middle line:84%
until they evolve
spiritually, their relationship

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.908 align:middle line:84%
with God is one of
the relationship

00:22:21.908 --> 00:22:27.914 align:middle line:84%
of the un...un-individuated,
un-mature, not, you know,

00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.949 align:middle line:84%
fully cooked relationship
with their parents.

00:22:29.949 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:33.419 align:middle line:84%
And the power of
emotion, in not emotion,

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:37.423 align:middle line:84%
and though [laughing]
but imagination, huh?

00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:42.295 align:middle line:84%
Where is that coming from and
how can we - is that really

00:22:42.295 --> 00:22:46.232 align:middle line:84%
like a martyr for
bringing even more?

00:22:46.232 --> 00:22:48.835 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, yeah...I
love the word imagine

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
because someone broke
it down recently,

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.573 align:middle line:84%
I saw this on a website
somewhere, it said "imagine,"

00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:56.776 align:middle line:90%
then it says "I...mag...in..."

00:22:56.776 --> 00:23:00.012 align:middle line:84%
and then it went,
"I'm...a...gin."

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:05.251 align:middle line:84%
And gin is the epic word
for genie, so I am a genie.

00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:07.653 align:middle line:84%
So the way we bring
into being things is

00:23:07.653 --> 00:23:10.156 align:middle line:84%
through our imagination, we
actually are like a genie,

00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:12.525 align:middle line:84%
you know, your wish
is my command.

00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:15.094 align:middle line:84%
And so when we realize
the power,

00:23:15.094 --> 00:23:17.497 align:middle line:84%
the creative power the
imagination is amazing,

00:23:17.497 --> 00:23:20.066 align:middle line:84%
that what we visualize,
what we think about,

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:24.704 align:middle line:84%
and fantasize about, we're
actually bringing about.

00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:26.906 align:middle line:84%
And so we're either bringing
about something we don't want,

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:29.075 align:middle line:84%
that's called worrying, because
you're visualizing the things

00:23:29.075 --> 00:23:30.276 align:middle line:90%
you don't want.

00:23:30.276 --> 00:23:33.079 align:middle line:84%
Or we are fantasizing and
imagining and bringing

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:34.447 align:middle line:90%
into being things we do want.

00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:36.482 align:middle line:84%
You know, a vision
of a better world,

00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:39.652 align:middle line:84%
vision of a healthier body,
a better relationship,

00:23:39.652 --> 00:23:42.088 align:middle line:84%
more abundance, more
peace, whatever it might be.

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm...I love it,

00:23:44.023 --> 00:23:46.125 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I wonder
where it comes from.

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:46.893 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: The imagination?

00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:48.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:49.762 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Well...

00:23:49.762 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: See sometimes
it comes to you, too,

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.665 align:middle line:84%
as you said, the
channeling part.

00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:55.067 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how
it can go vroom!

00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:58.905 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, I think
when you are, we are, I am,

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:01.974 align:middle line:84%
tuned in...meaning
we're not blocked by all

00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:05.845 align:middle line:84%
of our ego thoughts, and
we're in meditation or we're

00:24:05.845 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:90%
out in nature taking a walk,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.981 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of when the
mind is a little bit free,

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:90%
it's not so focused.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.752 align:middle line:90%
Those things we focus on,

00:24:12.752 --> 00:24:15.321 align:middle line:84%
there's actually
research on creativity.

00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:18.124 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
the incubation stage.

00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
In incubation, you really
- well, first of all,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.161 align:middle line:90%
you have a focus stage.

00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.729 align:middle line:84%
You focus really hard, like
Einstein trying to figure

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.131 align:middle line:90%
out the law of relativity.

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Or me writing about the success
principles and trying to figure

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.036 align:middle line:84%
out a problem I have
in my writing,

00:24:30.036 --> 00:24:34.073 align:middle line:84%
or wanting to understand, you
know, visualization let's say.

00:24:34.073 --> 00:24:36.108 align:middle line:90%
And then you let it go.

00:24:36.108 --> 00:24:39.145 align:middle line:84%
Just like, you know, the egg
is there and it's not hatching

00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:41.113 align:middle line:90%
for a while, it's incubating.

00:24:41.113 --> 00:24:43.883 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, all of a
sudden it's time for this idea

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:46.953 align:middle line:84%
to hatch, and it comes
up from the subconscious.

00:24:46.953 --> 00:24:49.355 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like we've
impregnated our subconscious

00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:50.556 align:middle line:90%
with an intention.

00:24:50.556 --> 00:24:52.725 align:middle line:84%
Some people would say we
impregnated source energy,

00:24:52.725 --> 00:24:54.293 align:middle line:90%
the universe, with intention.

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.428 align:middle line:90%
Probably both.

00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:58.531 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is it has to gestate.

00:24:58.531 --> 00:24:59.632 align:middle line:90%
And after it's gestated

00:24:59.632 --> 00:25:01.567 align:middle line:84%
for a certain amount
it's time to come out.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:05.371 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have enough
quiet time to actually hear it.

00:25:05.371 --> 00:25:07.406 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes it will
actually happen in the shower,

00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:09.642 align:middle line:84%
sometimes driving a car
because you're off daydreaming.

00:25:09.642 --> 00:25:11.677 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's while
you're walking on the ocean.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.846 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's in a
set of meditation.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:16.882 align:middle line:84%
So, and often when you're
waking up in that twilight state

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:19.785 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and
boom this idea comes in.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:22.888 align:middle line:84%
But that's the result of having
intended and struggled with

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and really thought
deeply about it.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.691 align:middle line:90%
So then you can let it go.

00:25:25.691 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ask, let it go,

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.296 align:middle line:84%
believe the universe will take
care of it, and then receive it.

00:25:30.296 --> 00:25:32.398 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
with creativity.

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:36.002 align:middle line:84%
I intend that I want a solution
to this problem or this idea.

00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:37.269 align:middle line:90%
I let it go.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.739 align:middle line:84%
It incubates in my subconscious
then the universal mind,

00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:41.907 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
I receive the idea,

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:45.211 align:middle line:84%
this breakthrough idea,
and that's how it works.

00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:49.315 align:middle line:84%
So it does mean you do need
to study, you do need to think

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:52.385 align:middle line:84%
about things, you need to
engage your intellectual mind,

00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:53.419 align:middle line:90%
but then release it.

00:25:53.419 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.055 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: And then eventually
the intuition takes over,

00:25:56.055 --> 00:25:59.425 align:middle line:84%
and then be open, have
some time, some space,

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:00.493 align:middle line:90%
where the idea can come.

00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:05.431 align:middle line:84%
With Chicken Soup for the
Soul, we had finished the book.

00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:06.632 align:middle line:90%
We had no title.

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:08.701 align:middle line:84%
Didn't have a clue what
it was going to be called.

00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:10.069 align:middle line:90%
Nice stories [laughing].

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:12.438 align:middle line:84%
And so Mark and I, Mark Victor
Hansen, my co-author and I,

00:26:12.438 --> 00:26:15.508 align:middle line:84%
we said we're going to meditate
every day for a week and see

00:26:15.508 --> 00:26:16.909 align:middle line:90%
if we can receive a title.

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:19.478 align:middle line:84%
But we intended, you know, we'd
struggled with titles and none

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:20.646 align:middle line:84%
of them worked, none
of them felt great.

00:26:20.646 --> 00:26:22.415 align:middle line:90%
So we went into meditation.

00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened the
first couple days.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.452 align:middle line:84%
The third day, I'm sitting
there in my bedroom,

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:30.489 align:middle line:84%
on my little meditation
pillow, and boom!

00:26:30.489 --> 00:26:33.025 align:middle line:84%
I see this chalkboard, and
this big hand comes out

00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:35.995 align:middle line:84%
and writes Chicken Soup on
it, in big white letters.

00:26:35.995 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said to the hand,

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.566 align:middle line:84%
"What the heck does chicken
soup have to do with our book?"

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the voice of the hand
said, "Um, when you were sick,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.907 align:middle line:84%
as a child, your grandmother
would give you chicken soup."

00:26:47.907 --> 00:26:49.709 align:middle line:84%
I said, "This isn't a
book about sick people!"

00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:52.545 align:middle line:84%
And the voice said,
"People's spirits are sick.

00:26:52.545 --> 00:26:54.714 align:middle line:84%
They're living in resignation,
fear and hopelessness."

00:26:54.714 --> 00:26:58.317 align:middle line:84%
This was in 92, there
was a recession going on,

00:26:58.317 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, "Chicken Soup
for the Spirit," "Chicken Soup

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:03.889 align:middle line:84%
for the Soul" and
I got goose bumps.

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:06.425 align:middle line:84%
And I called up, well I told
my wife, she got goose bumps.

00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:07.626 align:middle line:90%
Called Mark, he got goose bumps.

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:08.994 align:middle line:84%
Told our agent, he
got goose bumps.

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.464 align:middle line:84%
We went to New York,
talked to 22 publishers,

00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:12.598 align:middle line:84%
nobody got goose
bumps [laughing].

00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:17.203 align:middle line:84%
So it took us almost a
year to sell that book,

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:19.672 align:middle line:84%
but eventually Health
Communications bought it,

00:27:19.672 --> 00:27:23.375 align:middle line:84%
and the book went on to sell
ten million copies in English,

00:27:23.375 --> 00:27:26.445 align:middle line:84%
just in America, and probably
another 25 or 30 million

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
and spawned a series

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:33.753 align:middle line:84%
that now has 200 books plus,
and over a half billion books,

00:27:33.753 --> 00:27:35.154 align:middle line:90%
500 million books in print.

00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:40.626 align:middle line:84%
So that, when you get something
from meditation, and it comes

00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:42.928 align:middle line:84%
in like that, and I call
it goose bumps, God bumps,

00:27:42.928 --> 00:27:44.397 align:middle line:84%
in other words you're
getting a sense

00:27:44.397 --> 00:27:47.867 align:middle line:84%
that this is really important,
this is really right on.

00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:50.836 align:middle line:84%
That title went on to become
a brand, it's now valued

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:53.305 align:middle line:90%
at about 100 million dollars.

00:27:53.305 --> 00:27:54.306 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:27:54.306 --> 00:27:55.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, that's
a lot of money.

00:27:55.908 --> 00:27:57.243 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Yes, it is.

00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:59.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you feel
about that kind of money now?

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:01.147 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Well...

00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:01.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How is it -
what is your relationship

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:02.948 align:middle line:90%
to money these days?

00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:03.916 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Wonderful [laughing].

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:06.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Laughing]
Looks like it!

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.558 align:middle line:84%
No, you know, I see money
as encapsulated energy.

00:28:12.558 --> 00:28:16.095 align:middle line:84%
You know, we worked really
hard for a lot of years

00:28:16.095 --> 00:28:18.998 align:middle line:84%
to collect a lot of stories
and we came from our hearts

00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and we really cared, and
we worked hard to get

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.202 align:middle line:84%
that out there so people
would take advantage of it,

00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:24.837 align:middle line:90%
and we created a lot of value.

00:28:24.837 --> 00:28:26.639 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
value you give out,

00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:28.307 align:middle line:84%
then the more value
comes back to you.

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:30.609 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it comes in
the form of a bottle

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
of wine somebody gives you.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.145 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it comes in
the form of somebody

00:28:33.145 --> 00:28:34.413 align:middle line:90%
who wants to be your assistant.

00:28:34.413 --> 00:28:36.448 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it comes
in the form of money.

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:39.518 align:middle line:84%
And money, the nice thing about
money is you can exchange it

00:28:39.518 --> 00:28:40.619 align:middle line:90%
for anything pretty much.

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:41.987 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you want
to buy groceries,

00:28:41.987 --> 00:28:43.422 align:middle line:84%
you want to buy a car,
you want to buy a house,

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:46.192 align:middle line:84%
you want to buy a
ticket to go to Paris.

00:28:46.192 --> 00:28:48.194 align:middle line:90%
And, so, you know, I have a lot

00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:50.563 align:middle line:84%
of encapsulated energy
that's available to me.

00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:54.466 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of it's been
used to grow our business

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:55.968 align:middle line:84%
so that we can serve
more people.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:58.737 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a lot of
nice stuff around me,

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:00.206 align:middle line:84%
but I have no desire
for any more.

00:29:00.206 --> 00:29:02.041 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what would I do with it?

00:29:02.041 --> 00:29:05.411 align:middle line:84%
But I really like taking
the money and being able

00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:09.315 align:middle line:84%
to create scholarships for
people, to write more books,

00:29:09.315 --> 00:29:13.419 align:middle line:84%
to generate more products that
help to give to philanthropy,

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.821 align:middle line:84%
we do a lot of charitable
giving, and we always have.

00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:17.223 align:middle line:84%
In fact, with the
Chicken Soup books,

00:29:17.223 --> 00:29:20.259 align:middle line:84%
we've always given 10
percent, sometimes 25 percent,

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:24.129 align:middle line:84%
of the profits to a designated
charity related to the book.

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.931 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that the
more you give back,

00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:28.634 align:middle line:84%
the more that comes back,
and that's just a big cycle

00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:31.871 align:middle line:84%
that never ends, and
it's been very proven

00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:33.339 align:middle line:90%
to be true in my life.

00:29:33.339 --> 00:29:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.143 align:middle line:84%
So 100 million is 100 million
basically, there's no attachment

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.981 align:middle line:90%
or nothing, it just is?

00:29:41.981 --> 00:29:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, just like that
carpet is 100 million dollars

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.919 align:middle line:84%
is, I don't have all
of that right now,

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:49.788 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have partners that
it all gets divided up with,

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:54.059 align:middle line:84%
but the point being that you
know, money is not an issue

00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:55.761 align:middle line:84%
in my life anymore,
which is the life.

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:59.265 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's, you know, this guy
named Abraham Maslow has this

00:29:59.265 --> 00:30:00.966 align:middle line:84%
famous Maslow's Hierarchy
of Needs,

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that says once you've met your
basic survival needs for warmth

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.239 align:middle line:84%
and shelter and food and
water and protection,

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.441 align:middle line:84%
you've met your needs
for physical comfort,

00:30:09.441 --> 00:30:11.243 align:middle line:84%
you've met your needs
for friends,

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:13.412 align:middle line:84%
you've met your self-esteem
needs, which I have plenty

00:30:13.412 --> 00:30:15.314 align:middle line:84%
of because I feel like I've
done really great things

00:30:15.314 --> 00:30:17.216 align:middle line:90%
or I'm a nice guy, then you move

00:30:17.216 --> 00:30:18.884 align:middle line:84%
up into what they
call the higher needs,

00:30:18.884 --> 00:30:21.720 align:middle line:84%
self-actualization needs
which is now all I want

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
to do is actualize my full
potential and be of service.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why really your
tag line on your website is

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.495 align:middle line:84%
"Maximize Your Potential,"
that's really

00:30:29.495 --> 00:30:31.997 align:middle line:84%
to you the core,
the most important?

00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:33.899 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, maximizing
my human potential

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:36.001 align:middle line:84%
and helping everyone
else maximize theirs.

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.304 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we all
have amazing potential

00:30:38.304 --> 00:30:42.374 align:middle line:84%
for whether it's to be an
artist or to be, you know,

00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:46.111 align:middle line:84%
physically fit or to be
brilliant, speak five languages,

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, most people in
Europe speak five languages.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.516 align:middle line:84%
Most people in America
speak one or two.

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:54.219 align:middle line:84%
And you know, research tells us
the average person easily could

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.922 align:middle line:84%
learn to speak 12
languages if they chose to.

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:58.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Right.

00:30:58.324 --> 00:31:00.626 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: And, you know, I have a
friend who speaks 20 languages,

00:31:00.626 --> 00:31:03.762 align:middle line:84%
and then very cogently
and very articulately,

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:04.863 align:middle line:84%
and you know, a lot
of vocabulary.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:06.865 align:middle line:90%
So that's our potential.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.901 align:middle line:84%
Our potential is we can
all learn to walk on fire,

00:31:08.901 --> 00:31:10.869 align:middle line:84%
like Tony Robbins
does at his workshops,

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.304 align:middle line:90%
or you know, other people do.

00:31:12.304 --> 00:31:13.706 align:middle line:90%
We can learn to hold our breath

00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:16.075 align:middle line:84%
for four minutes
underwater if we choose to.

00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:18.644 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to sing, we can
learn to dance, we can learn

00:31:18.644 --> 00:31:22.147 align:middle line:84%
to write poetry, we
can learn to, you know,

00:31:22.147 --> 00:31:23.182 align:middle line:90%
do Internet marketing.

00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:25.217 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, we
have the potential.

00:31:25.217 --> 00:31:28.854 align:middle line:84%
And most people, psychologists
tell us we're using between 5

00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:31.423 align:middle line:84%
and 10 percent of our
potential, so I think we've got

00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:34.026 align:middle line:90%
to go at least 30 percent.

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:34.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:31:34.994 --> 00:31:36.195 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Yeah.

00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:38.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I know, you know
feng shui, because of,

00:31:38.864 --> 00:31:41.533 align:middle line:84%
from I know Marie Diamond, I had
the pleasure to interview her

00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:45.571 align:middle line:84%
in Monaco, and I know she's
done some work and you're aware

00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of the potentials,
is it something

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.775 align:middle line:90%
that you really looked at?

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:51.076 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, if you
look around my home,

00:31:51.076 --> 00:31:53.078 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all kinds
of feng shui.

00:31:53.078 --> 00:31:55.581 align:middle line:84%
You know, often what are
called solutions to problems.

00:31:55.581 --> 00:31:58.217 align:middle line:84%
You put a water function here,
you hang a crystal there,

00:31:58.217 --> 00:32:01.887 align:middle line:84%
put plants here, etc. Marie
Diamond was the first person

00:32:01.887 --> 00:32:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to feng shui her home, and then
now a guy named Master Yao,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.159 align:middle line:84%
he's Chinese, I call
him "Mazzayao, Mazzayao,

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:90%
he fix a house," you know?

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:08.861 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing].

00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou:

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:10.329 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughing ]

00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: But every
year, you know,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.898 align:middle line:90%
he comes, and things change.

00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:16.935 align:middle line:84%
You know, as things in the
universe change, so we update.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:19.838 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you, Marie
Diamond came in that corner

00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:23.842 align:middle line:84%
over there was a table on
point, and I said I wanted

00:32:23.842 --> 00:32:25.611 align:middle line:84%
to do more international
travel, and she said,

00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:29.114 align:middle line:84%
"Well that's your success
corner, and you need

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:30.416 align:middle line:90%
to put a globe there."

00:32:30.416 --> 00:32:32.851 align:middle line:84%
So we put a globe there, and
within about three months,

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:34.887 align:middle line:84%
I got invited to speak in
11 different countries.

00:32:34.887 --> 00:32:37.289 align:middle line:84%
My wife said, "We're taking
the globe out of the corner,

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.223 align:middle line:90%
because you're never home."

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:38.724 align:middle line:90%
[Laughing]

00:32:38.724 --> 00:32:39.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou:

00:32:39.258 --> 00:32:40.526 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughing ]

00:32:40.526 --> 00:32:43.228 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: So we saw very
quick results from feng shui.

00:32:43.228 --> 00:32:44.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh-huh.

00:32:44.396 --> 00:32:47.332 align:middle line:84%
So there's some outside
tools to help us,

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:50.803 align:middle line:84%
but there is really this...is
it really all those tools are

00:32:50.803 --> 00:32:52.905 align:middle line:90%
helping us to really realign

00:32:52.905 --> 00:32:56.308 align:middle line:84%
and so we can attract really
all those amazing things

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:57.643 align:middle line:90%
that we want?

00:32:57.643 --> 00:32:59.745 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes we focus a
little bit too much outside

00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:00.446 align:middle line:90%
don't we?

00:33:00.446 --> 00:33:01.947 align:middle line:90%
Outside of ourselves?

00:33:01.947 --> 00:33:04.049 align:middle line:84%
Like feng shui alone
is not enough.

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.485 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Yeah, I think Marie
Diamond says, you know,

00:33:06.485 --> 00:33:09.288 align:middle line:84%
she divides, she calls
it luck in the tradition

00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:12.858 align:middle line:84%
that she's trained in, and she
says one-third luck is your

00:33:12.858 --> 00:33:16.161 align:middle line:84%
Karma, one-third luck is
what you do in this life,

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:17.329 align:middle line:84%
the kind of thing
we're talking about,

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:19.364 align:middle line:90%
100 percent responsibility.

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:22.501 align:middle line:84%
And one-third can be
affected by feng shui,

00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:26.872 align:middle line:84%
the energy that you direct by
rearranging your environment,

00:33:26.872 --> 00:33:29.541 align:middle line:84%
the colors, and all of the
ways, you know wood here,

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.478 align:middle line:84%
and metal there, and
water there, and so forth.

00:33:32.478 --> 00:33:34.379 align:middle line:90%
And so my point of view,

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.315 align:middle line:84%
let's say we're only
30 percent responsible,

00:33:36.315 --> 00:33:37.983 align:middle line:84%
but I want to be 100
percent responsible

00:33:37.983 --> 00:33:39.785 align:middle line:90%
for my 30 percent, you know?

00:33:39.785 --> 00:33:41.987 align:middle line:84%
The problem in relationships
is when people say, "Oh,

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.256 align:middle line:84%
you know it's a 50/50
relationship

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:46.792 align:middle line:84%
and it's always your 50 percent
that's the problem" you know?

00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:49.928 align:middle line:90%
So I think when I worked

00:33:49.928 --> 00:33:52.264 align:middle line:84%
with literally probably
a million students

00:33:52.264 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:84%
in the last 40 years,
that the people that act

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:58.704 align:middle line:84%
as if they're 100
percent responsible,

00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
they have the most amazing
lives, because they say, "Okay,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.109 align:middle line:84%
if this is happening,
how did I create it?

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:04.943 align:middle line:90%
How did I promote it?

00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:06.411 align:middle line:90%
How do I allow it to continue?"

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:09.214 align:middle line:84%
So if you look, you're
going to see an answer.

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:12.851 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't believe that
everyone who dies in a Tsunami,

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.318 align:middle line:84%
or every plane that
goes down everyone

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.122 align:middle line:84%
on that plane was karmically
responsible for that plane going

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
down or that tsunami happening,
especially little children.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:24.229 align:middle line:90%
But, I do believe that if we act

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:26.497 align:middle line:84%
as if we're 100 percent
responsible for everything

00:34:26.497 --> 00:34:29.334 align:middle line:84%
that happens, our lives
are much more magical,

00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:32.470 align:middle line:84%
much more successful,
much more joyful.

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about the
world and what's happening

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.544 align:middle line:84%
in the world and how things
are shifting maybe for people?

00:34:38.544 --> 00:34:40.312 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel people are awakening

00:34:40.312 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to view it that way?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.615 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: Yes, I do.

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:47.352 align:middle line:84%
I've traveled just in the last,
I don't know, five months?

00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:51.757 align:middle line:84%
I've been in Oman, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Dubai, India,

00:34:51.757 --> 00:34:54.126 align:middle line:84%
going to Poland in
a couple of months.

00:34:54.126 --> 00:34:59.565 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Bali, Hong Kong,
etc. And everywhere I go,

00:34:59.565 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I see huge amounts of
awakening occurring.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I see it in the way people in
general are acting and talking,

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.606 align:middle line:84%
I see it in the media,
I see it on television,

00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:08.774 align:middle line:90%
I see it in my workshops.

00:35:08.774 --> 00:35:10.576 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
kind of energy there.

00:35:10.576 --> 00:35:14.213 align:middle line:84%
I see it in the laws
that are being passed.

00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:16.381 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously, there's all kinds
of pain and trauma in the world,

00:35:16.381 --> 00:35:18.884 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in Syria, or
Egypt, or Lebanon or wherever,

00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:24.156 align:middle line:84%
South Africa, you know,
but whenever I look at it,

00:35:24.156 --> 00:35:27.593 align:middle line:84%
I see that there's these -
things are breaking apart.

00:35:27.593 --> 00:35:29.995 align:middle line:84%
And even though it may look
uncomfortable and bloody

00:35:29.995 --> 00:35:31.396 align:middle line:84%
and some people are
getting hurt and they are,

00:35:31.396 --> 00:35:36.468 align:middle line:84%
in the bigger picture, the old
forms aren't working anymore,

00:35:36.468 --> 00:35:41.273 align:middle line:84%
you know, the breakdown
of the financial system.

00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:42.374 align:middle line:90%
People are questioning

00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:44.076 align:middle line:84%
that a whole lot more
than they ever did.

00:35:44.076 --> 00:35:47.246 align:middle line:84%
Social justice, the
way the economy works,

00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:51.216 align:middle line:84%
the way you know the whole
environmental movement,

00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:53.719 align:middle line:90%
the self-empowerment movement.

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:55.921 align:middle line:84%
The unimaginable number
of coaches there are.

00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:57.189 align:middle line:84%
The unimaginable
number of people

00:35:57.189 --> 00:36:00.325 align:middle line:84%
like yourself who've got
TV shows, whether they're

00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:03.729 align:middle line:84%
on cable channels, whether
they're on Internet channels,

00:36:03.729 --> 00:36:05.898 align:middle line:84%
there's just more
and more light,

00:36:05.898 --> 00:36:09.635 align:middle line:84%
more and more people you know
talking about meditation,

00:36:09.635 --> 00:36:12.037 align:middle line:84%
waking up, talking
about compassion,

00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:13.639 align:middle line:90%
the law of attraction, whatever.

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:17.342 align:middle line:84%
You know, in China the number
one DVD for the last couple

00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:19.478 align:middle line:90%
of years has been The Secret.

00:36:19.478 --> 00:36:20.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Really!

00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:21.346 align:middle line:90%
>> J.C.: I mean, who knew?

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:22.648 align:middle line:84%
You know? And we see
that all over the world.

00:36:22.648 --> 00:36:26.151 align:middle line:84%
I think The Secret is
like in 17 languages now.

00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:29.154 align:middle line:84%
People in Africa who couldn't
afford to buy them were lining

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:31.456 align:middle line:84%
up in Nigeria and places
like that just to get

00:36:31.456 --> 00:36:33.125 align:middle line:90%
into the theater to watch it.

00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:36.128 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
obviously, you know many

00:36:36.128 --> 00:36:39.264 align:middle line:84%
of those places there's
a lot of pain and misery,

00:36:39.264 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:84%
but I think you know
often people have

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.636 align:middle line:84%
to hit bottom before they kind
of go, "This sucks, I don't want

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:47.005 align:middle line:84%
to do it anymore, I'm sick and
tired of being sick and tired."

00:36:47.005 --> 00:36:50.709 align:middle line:84%
But even though, I have
so many friends right now

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.311 align:middle line:84%
that are building
schools in Africa,

00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:55.947 align:middle line:84%
that are providing scholarships
for girls to go to college,

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.549 align:middle line:90%
that are empowering women.

00:36:57.549 --> 00:37:00.118 align:middle line:84%
We see the women's movement
in third world countries,

00:37:00.118 --> 00:37:03.422 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, in the
middle east, in India.

00:37:03.422 --> 00:37:04.756 align:middle line:84%
This girl, Malika
[assumed spelling],

00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:06.158 align:middle line:90%
in Pakistan standing up.

00:37:06.158 --> 00:37:08.927 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would have been
unheard of ten years ago.

00:37:08.927 --> 00:37:10.529 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm, beautiful!

00:37:10.529 --> 00:37:13.965 align:middle line:84%
Is there last thoughts
you want to leave us with?

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.001 align:middle line:84%
>> J.C.: Well, I mean the
thought I always leave everyone

00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:18.937 align:middle line:84%
with is you can have anything
you want if you believe it.

00:37:18.937 --> 00:37:21.106 align:middle line:84%
You have within you
everything you need

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:25.277 align:middle line:84%
to get everything you want, but
you have to become conscious.

00:37:25.277 --> 00:37:26.244 align:middle line:90%
You have to focus on it.

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.612 align:middle line:90%
You have to put time in on it.

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:31.416 align:middle line:84%
You have to - I believe
success can be effortless,

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:33.418 align:middle line:90%
but it does require attention.

00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:34.753 align:middle line:90%
You have to put some time in.

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.
