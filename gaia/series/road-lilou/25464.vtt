00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.038 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:13.966 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, hello.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.150 align:middle line:10%
This is Lilou for Gaiam TV, and
today I'm in Holland, actually

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
rainy Holland with
British-- maybe because I'm

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.800 align:middle line:10%
sitting with a Brit.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Tim-- Tim Freke.
-I bring it with me.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I bring the weather with me.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It follows the English
everywhere they go.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.995 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
mysteries of existence.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to do
is this video here

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:90%
in a cemetery over in Holland.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
It might appear quite strange,
but Tim is an un-ordinary man,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:90%
a free thinker and philosopher.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%
You wrote over 30 books.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And your latest one is
"The Mystery Experience"

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:90%
that we'll go into.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
This is quite a
special conversation.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:90%
I love interviewing Tim.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:90%
You're fun, bubbly.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It's fresh.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It's clear.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It goes straight in, and it's
wonderful to be with you today.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
being available.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
For me, my passion is
to share these ideas.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have a
passion for what I

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
call the deep awake state, for
this awakening that can happen.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
It seems it's
completely natural.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:90%
It's available to everyone.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And I would just like as
many people as possible

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to experience it and to
share it with other people.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So the opportunity
to share ideas

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
about which I have
passion is something

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%
to be embraced, so thank you.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Tell us, why are we
here at this cemetery?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a little--
life brought us here, honestly.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.360 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't like
everything was planned.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But there's a little
thing for you here.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I spend a fair amount
of time in cemeteries.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.251 align:middle line:90%
It's a very sobering place.

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a good place to walk,
if you're a philosopher,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.674 align:middle line:84%
and think, and to realize
how precious life is.

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
surrounded by death.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.015 align:middle line:84%
And you're also surrounded
by the mystery of existence,

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that you are on this journey
between the beginning

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of your life and what is
coming, the end of your life.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:10%
And I worked with
people who were dying

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:10%
at one point in my life
for the same reason,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:10%
partly because I wanted
to give something, express

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.930 align:middle line:10%
my love of others and be
there in people's distress,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:10%
but also because coming face
to face with the end of life,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:10%
I think, can cast great
light on life itself.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Plato, Socrates-- one of my
heroes, philosophical heroes,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
said the whole of philosophy
is a meditation on death.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, I
think that's true.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I've just finished
making a movie,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
which starts in a graveyard
for that very reason.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like if we can-- it
feels like, like let's

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
get to the heart of things.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:90%
We're alive.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what it is.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.270 align:middle line:90%
We're going to die.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what that is.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Now what are we
going to do about it?

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the mystery.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:10%
So we'll go back
later on about this,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:10%
but first I would love to
hear-- I know you bring

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:10%
some scientific
proof, and you bridge

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:10%
science with spirituality,
and that's an important part.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:10%
Could you tell us
what kind of science

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:10%
are we talking about here?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:10%
And how do you bridge
that in your books

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:10%
and in your workshops?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, "The Mystery Experience,"
my new book, the subtitle

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
is "A Revolutionary Approach
to Spiritual Awakening."

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And why I felt the need to try
and do that was, after having

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.510 align:middle line:84%
written all of these books on
different spiritual traditions,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
studying what they were
saying, trying to translate

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
these often-ancient ideas into
an idiom we can understand now,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
it felt more important than
ever to find a new language,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
a new philosophy,
which has arisen

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
from the old, like everything
does-- and nothing's ever new,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
really; it always arises
from what's gone before--

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
but which articulated
this perennial philosophy

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:84%
in an evolved way,
an evolution of it,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%
so that we could really get it.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Because this really matters.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I really think that
there's something very

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
deep at the heart
of spirituality

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
which needs to come into
mainstream consciousness.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that's
happening, but very slowly.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Still, it's kind of
in a mystical ghetto,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
where people have kept
it alive for centuries.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And my passion is to say,
look, can we take this

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.181 align:middle line:90%
out into mainstream culture?

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, I
think there's numbers

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of things which have to happen.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
The biggest obstacle
is spirituality itself.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not that everyone
else is stupid

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
or they haven't got
it or they're blind.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
what's going on.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I think what's going on is
that spirituality itself

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
needs to evolve
further so that it

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%
can reach people more directly.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:90%
There's things wrong with it.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of modern
spirituality is very good,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.140 align:middle line:84%
but a lot it's also
very superstitious.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:84%
People who have come through
scientific background, or just

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
thinking people generally,
often look at it

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and think, well, that's
a little bit nuts.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is,
it is a bit nuts.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get in there
and pull out what's nuts

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and find the gem
which is at its heart.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to speak
to them on condition.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of spirituality-- maybe
we can discuss this later as

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
well-- is rooted
in the past and is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally world-rejecting.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It's often been
created by celibate men

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
living in monasteries or in
caves, and it has that flavor.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's about pushing
the world away.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
This is all an
illusion, rejection

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
of the personal, all
our personal attachments

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and desires are all wrong.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:90%
We need to get rid of those.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, we need to get rid
of the whole personal self,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
is wrong and is in the way.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, often you hear
in spiritual circles

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a little personal
self inside your head

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
who's out to get you
and stop you awakening.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.234 align:middle line:84%
It's like you've got the devil
inside going, no, no, no.

00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't want you to waken.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It's your ego trying to-- all of
this seems profoundly mistaken

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to me and rooted in the past.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other big thing, which
is where your question came

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
from, is that 21st spirituality
needs to be congruent, needs

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to be harmonious with
the awesome discoveries

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:90%
of modern science.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Any form of spirituality
which cannot

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
be harmonious with modern
science is finished, I feel.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.440 align:middle line:10%
Or science needs to evolve,
because right now, there

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:10%
is this whole science,
materialism science, that just

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:10%
is no longer
matching the reality

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:10%
and what we're finding
of the placebo effect

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:10%
and of all the wonderful
things, the self-healing.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the great
problems in human culture

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
with everything is
ideas tend to arise

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
with an inspired little
group of people who glimpse

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:90%
into the depths of life.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And then the ideas spread.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
As they spread, often they're
completely misunderstood.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:90%
You find this in religion.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I've written a
lot about religion

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and how it misinterprets the
mystical heart of spirituality.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing has
happened in science.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the great
sages of spirituality,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they're saying
something very deep.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
If you go to mass religion,
it's often very superficial.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
In science, materialism, this
reductionism, as everything

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
can be reduced to matter--
this is what really exists,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:84%
and anything else
is just nonsense,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and really, it's all your genes,
and when you fall in love,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just chemicals, and
the birds are singing now

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
beautifully, but
really, it's just

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
their marking their territory.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's reducing everything,
the wonder of life

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:84%
down, as if yes, yes, it
looks like it's wonderful,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%
but really it's just this.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That form of science
I feel has been

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
outdated for over 100 years.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.301 align:middle line:84%
In the mass mind generally,
people think that's science.

00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of scientists
think that's science.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.310 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
over 100 years ago

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
was that the physicists, the
people at the cutting edge,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.746 align:middle line:84%
have discovered that matter
doesn't really exist,

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
that this isn't here in the
way that we think it is at all.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Now once you've
reached that point,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
and when you have the great
Nobel Prize winning physicists,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Niels Bohr, Einstein,
indeed, lots of them--

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I quote them at
length in my book,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
so they speak
themselves-- these people

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:90%
are saying that that's finished.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.040 align:middle line:90%
That no longer makes any sense.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
We need a whole new
paradigm for science

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
because of what we found.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So materialist science and
superficial spirituality

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:90%
are never going to harmonize.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But this deep science and
this deep spirituality, these

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
are very natural bedfellows.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
They really-- they're opposites,
but they co-exist perfectly.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And they express
the same insights

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:90%
from opposite perspectives.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:90%
And that is quantum physics.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics was the
big breakthrough, I think.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, misunderstood,
but incredibly profound

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and mysterious.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you find
in quantum physics which I find

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
really intriguing
is what it points

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to is that the fundamental
nature of reality

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.299 align:middle line:90%
is paradoxical.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the very center of
the philosophy, which I explore

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
both in terms of harmonizing
science and spirituality,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
but also in terms of your
personal awakening, actually

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
waking up to this
deep, awake state,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
to a love of life and a
personal transformation.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And the center of my book,
"The Mystery Experience,"

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
is a new way of thinking,
which embraces paradox.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I call it
paralogical thinking.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
paralogical thinking

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
is that a paradox is not a
problem to be solved always,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that when you get down to the
depths of life, a paradox,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
or what I call a paradoxity,
is actually the solution.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
When you reach the
paradox, you've actually

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.353 align:middle line:84%
found what you're looking for.
Now--

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Give us an example here.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So-- well, let me just
tell you about heritage

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of that idea for a
moment, because I

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:90%
framed it in a very new way.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.155 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully in the
book, it's comes alive.

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
you can apply everywhere.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got
it, you just find--

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:84%
ooh, ooh, ooh-- everywhere
you look there's this paradox.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's an old idea.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go
back to ancient China

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of the Tao,
which is the mystery of life,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
is rising as yin and yang.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Most people are familiar
with the yin and yang sign.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got the black and the
white, and they're in movement,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and one contains the other.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a little dot
of black in the white

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and a little dot of
white in the black.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And life is this paradox in
which the opposites co-exist.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
You can also see it in the
ideas of Plato and Socrates,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
in the dialectics.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You can see it right-- in
fact, I would say that it's

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
one of the most fundamental
ideas underlying

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the whole of Western
philosophy, arising in Hegel--

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:90%
just over and over again.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Life is paradoxical, and
when you reach the depths,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:90%
the opposites coexist.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I find
fascinating is then

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:84%
you come to the
quantum physicists,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and they found the same thing.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
When they were looking at the
fundamental nature of this--

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean light, actually,
the thing which illuminates

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:90%
everything but you can't see.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
How's that for a paradox?

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:90%
What is its nature?

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
was that if you set up

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
an experiment in a certain way,
light appears to be made up

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
of little discrete particles.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But if you set it up
in a different way,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:90%
light appears to be one wave.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.021 align:middle line:84%
So they were faced
with, which is it?

00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it a wave?
Is it a particle?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, logical thinking is
based on it's either this

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:90%
or it's not this.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's one or the other.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how we think logically.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And for most purposes,
logical thinking is fantastic.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
We should be more logical.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of spirituality
is illogical,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and it drives me nuts.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:90%
But that's another video.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But that's another discussion.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
But it does.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So I want to make it clear that
I've got nothing against logic.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:90%
We need it-- on the surface.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to understand
the depths of life,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
you need to think
paralogically, which

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
means you can see, as the
quantum physicists discovered,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that at the depths, you can
see things in opposite ways,

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're both true.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So they came to the
conclusion, look,

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:84%
it's both a wave and
a particle, depending

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:90%
on how you look at it.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And Niels Bohr, one of the
pioneers of quantum physics,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobel Prize winner, great man,
he actually took the yin yang

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
sign, the ancient symbol, and
stuck it on his coat of arms

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
when he designed it,
and put underneath it

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
"The opposites are
complementary."

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
That's a direct echo
back to ancient Taoism.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what he's found.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:84%
He'd found the
opposites co-exist.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the implications of this--
well, let me quote Niels Bohr,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
again because I'm a fan.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you're looking at
trivial truths, what I would

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.430 align:middle line:84%
call surface truths, the
opposite of something

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
which is true is false.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:90%
That's logic.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to understand
deep truths, he said,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the opposite of a deep
truth is also true.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, that flies in
the face of logic,

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
but if we think paralogically,
we can start to understand, ah,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
right, so when we
find the paradox,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the nature
of reality from two

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
but opposite
perspectives at once.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me give
you some examples.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's deal with them
coming through science

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and spirituality straight off.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They're a paralogical pair--
deep science I'm talking

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%
about and deep spirituality.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Deep science looks outwards
into the objective world.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's an objective
investigation, which goes,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:90%
what are these appearances?

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
There's this incredible
pageant of colors and shapes

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and sounds, and what is it?

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And it started off by
going, well, there it is.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it looked into it, and
the more it looked into it,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
the more it found that what it
appeared to be on the surface

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:39.130 align:middle line:84%
was the opposite of what it
was underneath the surface.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.071 align:middle line:84%
So on the surface, this is a
physical object, very tangible.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It's real.
And to deny that is crazy.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
You'd literally go
nuts, wouldn't you?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm holding a mic with it.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.391 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, right, yeah--
all of this, everything.

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Right.
You, me, is ahh!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But we now know that
99.999999999990%--

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
a lot-- is nothing.
It's empty space.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Like the universe is
mostly empty space.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
When you come into the subatomic
world, it's just not there.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So here's a paradox.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:84%
My hand is both there,
and it is not there.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Which is true?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're both true.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, for living on the
surface in the world of logic,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:90%
either/or logic, it's there.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to understand
the depths, you have to go,

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's also not there.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
How does that change
my consciousness?

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
If I look at my hand,
if I look at you and go,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
ooh, you're there
and you're not there.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm here and I'm not here.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And both are true.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And can I see those two
perspectives at once?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're doing when
we're thinking paralogically.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So science has gone out
and gone, ooh, look,

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it's there
and it's not there,

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:90%
into the objective world.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, spirituality,
deep spirituality,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is the paralogical
complement of that.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it goes
in the opposite direction.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Here we are sitting in
this beautiful graveyard,

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:90%
full of all these appearances.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Science goes, what
are the appearances?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality goes,
who's looking at them?

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
essential difference.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:90%
What are these?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:90%
This is spirituality-- who am I?

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
experiencing this?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So it makes the journey
inward, if you like.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It comes this way.
Who's looking?

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Who's looking?

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you go inward, you appear
to be this body on the surface,

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and then there's,
well, what else am I?

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And the very first
thing you discover,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty obvious,
is you're not just a body.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
You discover that you're
also a soul or a psyche.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:90%
The word psyche is Greek.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:90%
It just means soul.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And you come back into
yourself, and there's

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
another whole subjective
world of the psyche, where

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
there's all these
imaginations, thoughts

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and images and feelings.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's an endless world.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
You turn your attention
into it, and it goes,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
it's as infinite as this world.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:90%
You can explore it forever.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've done a lot,
and you can just

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
go on and on and on-- and
archetypes and the world

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:90%
of psychology.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's not in space.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We are sitting
here-- apart from me,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
because I jump about and move
my arms-- but you're being--

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We're essentially-- the
bodies are just sitting here.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And the action is
all taking place

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
in the psyche, in the soul,
of this world of ideas.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
communicating.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:90%
So here's my body and your body.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And then through this vibration
in the air of these symbols,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
these words, this--
[BLOWS OUT]--

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
reaching across to your
ear, this psyche, this soul,

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
which is not in space--
where is it?-- is

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:90%
communicating with another one.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.497 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty interesting.

00:16:46.497 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.891 align:middle line:84%
That takes the conversation
to a whole other level, yes.

00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, right.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So through these
forms, material forms,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
something which has
no material existence

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
is connecting with
something which

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:90%
has no material existence.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And then you keep going.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all right, so I'm
witnessing right now,

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm witnessing my body,
this world of matter

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
and the sensation, and I'm
wielding this other world

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:90%
of imagination.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a
paradoxity for a start.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm witnessing
is a paradox.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:22.120 align:middle line:84%
It's both material and abstract,
immaterial, at the same time.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Which is it?
Well, it's both.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm still left with,
well, who's looking?

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that's
experiencing both

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.650 align:middle line:90%
the sensation and the thoughts?

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
What is that being,
which is always there,

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
which is witnessing Tim doing
this, witnessing the thoughts

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, witnessing you
nodding, witnessing the birds

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:90%
singing.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the essence
of deep spirituality,

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
is finding your being.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.080 align:middle line:84%
The word "spirit" really
points to your being.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:90%
"Spirit" means "essence."

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an old-fashioned word.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult word,
"spirit," because you

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.800 align:middle line:84%
get this idea of a
spirit being some sort

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:90%
of ghouly, ghosty thing.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's really pointing to
your being, your essence.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
"Essence" comes from
"essay," "to be."

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:90%
It's your being.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So what is your being?
What is it you are?

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
What is that thing you call "I"
that is witnessing all of this?

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So the journey in takes you
to this mysterious presence

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
within which all of these
experiences are arising.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, how we match those
two insights it's together

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:90%
is the challenge.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think we can.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
Tell us.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue on
this, and let's bring

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in the practical aspect,
too, because sometimes I

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
feel that we see it through
just life, and most of us

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
walk through just
life as it is, not

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
really embracing that thought
that we're a soul, too.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But do you think
there is a way that it

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:90%
can co-exist at all time?

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And is there a solution,
that we can experience spirit

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.280 align:middle line:90%
and physicality all the time?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And isn't this the key to
having a fulfilled life?

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I think is there all the time.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Just like the quantum field
is there all the time.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This is both nothing and
something all the time.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Spirit is there all the
time, consciousness,

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.520 align:middle line:90%
whatever you call that, being.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
be conscious of it

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
or pay attention
to it all the time.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Our attention needs to move.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The art of awakening is that
when you want to, it's there.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Now at first, it's
hard to do that.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Because at first it's hard to
do anything with your attention.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
If you want to play the piano,
at first it's hard to do that.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
If you do it a lot, you
can not play for a month,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and you'll still be able
to sit down and play.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
With this awakening,
it's the same.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to become familiar
with this awake state,

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.974 align:middle line:84%
and then we can pay it
attention, and there it is.

00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a new language.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:10%
Some people say
that playing music

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:10%
and playing a new instrument
is learning a new language.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And we should add
that language-- well,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
some people think that we should
add this language to our world.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:90%
So here it's the same.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:10%
We're learning a new mechanism,
a new way of being in life that

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:10%
will include all
of those paradox,

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:10%
and we can just dwell in that.
Tell us more.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like you said, we live
on the surface most the time.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
We think we know what this is.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
This is why my book's called
"The Mystery Experience,"

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
because the key, the
doorway is to realize

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what this is.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.870 align:middle line:90%
We have ideas about what it is.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:90%
And we need those.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But all of our ideas are
like flotsam and jetsam.

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They're like floating around
on this vast ocean of mystery

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know what this is.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows what this is.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's just
phenomenal, just to get that.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Just sit with that for a minute.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows what this is.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly you just--
you come out of that,

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:90%
and you see the depths of this.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.990 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, you are able
to see things in new ways.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So here's another paradoxity.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I both know and don't
know what this is.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
On the surface, I know
I'm talking with you.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
my philosophy,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
we're communicating,
we're sitting

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in a graveyard, da, da, da.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all true.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.912 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know what life is.

00:21:23.912 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what actually
these appearances are.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how something can
be both there and not there.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's all profoundly mysterious.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what, you know,
death and-- [EXHALES]--

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, yeah,
I know what it is,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know what it is.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all resting on nothing.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's a little thing I
love, a little insight

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:90%
which works for me.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I was just the other day just
thinking, look, everything--

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
everything-- this
bench and my body

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and the camera and everything
and the stuff in Australia

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.880 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the world,
it's all resting on the Earth.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.596 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is
resting on nothing.

00:22:07.596 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And that little-- I
mean, it's playful.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But what it does
to me is that like,

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that's like
that with my ideas.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
All my ideas seem to
be resting on reality,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
but reality itself is
resting on the mystery.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what it is.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
doorways in, and why

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I love walking in graveyards,
is because if you come

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
into the mystery,
if you recognize,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is the wonder
of being that we are,

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
suddenly everything
starts to sparkle.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly everything is
alive with its magic.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:90%
It's magic now.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Every moment is magic.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the key
thing is that we

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:90%
need a philosophy of science.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:10%
You see, the trouble with
reductionism is it kills magic.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It says, oh, there's no magic.
It's just this.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's rubbish. [LAUGHS]

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
What science really
says is it's more magic

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:90%
than you can possibly imagine.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It's more incredible than
the mind can comprehend.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.605 align:middle line:84%
And the more you look at it, the
more you'll just go, wow-- wow.

00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:90%
And spirituality is the same.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
If you come deep into
the subjective experience

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:90%
of your being, wow.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.754 align:middle line:84%
And then you're awake,
but you're deep awake.

00:23:27.754 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You're living on the surface,
where it's all doing this,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this
deep whoo going on.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And that changes everything.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.621 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way that
it could go too deep?

00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Too deep?
So deep you start drowning?

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Too deep that we don't live
anymore in reality and make

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
things happen.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Ah, yes.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, you see, there is--
that's a great question,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:84%
because one of the issues I have
that I explore in the book--

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That I keep on writing.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.472 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my 30th book.

00:23:55.472 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the one, though.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.572 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that I've
pulled it all together-- I hope.

00:24:01.572 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I take a very playful approach.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:10%
And I have these
discussions with--

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:10%
-Thank God for that.
-Yeah.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
We can't take it--
look, life is so

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:90%
serious we have to laugh at it.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for the Brits.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
--[LAUGHING] Well, humor--
there's a paradoxity.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Humor works because you take
things that shouldn't sit

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.430 align:middle line:90%
together and put them together.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.097 align:middle line:84%
That's why humor--
humor's a paradoxity.

00:24:22.097 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:84%
You take something
really serious,

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and you make fun of it.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly it's
like, oh, great.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So we need to do that.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I do, I take something,
which is really precious to me,

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:90%
and I make fun of it.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So I have this character, who
is really a part of me, I guess,

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
who I call Swami
Blandananda, and I

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.460 align:middle line:84%
have these little
conversations with Swami

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Blandananda in the book.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.275 align:middle line:84%
And Swami Blandananda represents
a view of spirituality

00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that I have been involved in
myself in the past, which I no

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:90%
longer feel comfortable with.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it's
reductionist, like science,

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:90%
but in the opposite direction.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:90%
So it rejects life.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:84%
It goes, look, this
is all an illusion.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:10%
It's really all one.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:90%
There is no Tim and Lilou.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.670 align:middle line:90%
All of this means nothing.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Just awaken from the dream.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It's this meaningless thing
that we've got caught up.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Escape from your bonds, and
you can be in La La Land.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's facetious.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:90%
You can be in the great One.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
What that's doing, it seems to
me, is making the same mistake.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
It's still either/or.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It's going, look, here this
world of separateness is wrong.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:90%
Here it's all one.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
As you come back into the deep
self, it truly is all one.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we need to
reject the separateness,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
reject Tim, reject the
ego, reject your humanity,

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
reject your emotions,
reject your attachments,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
reject your personal
loves, all the things

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.111 align:middle line:84%
that tie you to separate
and make it seem important.

00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Go.
Leave them.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:90%
This is either/or again.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going, it's either
separateness or oneness.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's both.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It's both one,
and it's separate.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a wave, and it's particles.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not either/or.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:10%
It's both at the same time.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So what I see is that
reductionist science goes

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
out and goes, look, it's
just a mechanical world where

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:90%
it's just cause and effect.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately what it does
is it divides up reality

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
into tiny, tiny,
and tinier, tinier,

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
tinier little bits until
you've got little nothing.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You've explained life
by destroying it.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And this reductionist
spirituality

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
does the same thing in
the other direction.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It just makes it
bigger and bigger

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.832 align:middle line:84%
into one big oneness until
you've got one big blob.

00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:45.500 align:middle line:84%
In which all of your human
adventure means nothing,

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and you have no freedom,
and none of this is--

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and you've explained
life by destroying it.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we need is a form
of science and spirituality

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.210 align:middle line:84%
which aren't reductionist,
which go, yeah, that is true,

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:90%
It is all one big wave.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're discrete
little particles.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying
to articulate is

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
a way we can understand that.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
paralogical thinking.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Because then you realize, OK,
so it's going to be opposites.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be this or that.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to choose.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
On a deep level, it's
going to be this and that.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Both-- and-- not either/or.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're both all one,
and it's all separate.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly, I think
that's what both science

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:90%
and deep spirituality say.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Science is looking
at all the way

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.100 align:middle line:84%
these discrete individual
bits, whether it's

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
a body or a cell or an
atom, how do they function?

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And then as it
goes through that,

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
it finds this paradoxical
world in which

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:90%
it's both waves and particles.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And below that, there is a
fundamental oneness which

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:84%
can't be described,
an energy field,

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
something, a mystery
of being from which

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:90%
everything is arising.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But science is
predicated on the idea

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
that fundamentally,
everything is one.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It's all arisen, literally, from
the oneness, the singularity.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
13 and 1/2 billion years ago,
something comes from nothing.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:90%
How paradoxical is that?

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And boomph, it's a
singularity, from one point,

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
infinitesimally small
oomph, comes everything.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So you and I, we
are the singularity.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Hello, singularity.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
We are the singularity
become conscious of itself

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
through this incredible
process of evolution.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:10%
But fundamentally, it's
one, but it's developed

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:10%
into complex, individual forms.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And through that, it is
now conscious of itself.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So we are the universe,
which has evolved

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
into these complex forms,
that oneness, become separate,

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and now looking at
itself and tasting

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.985 align:middle line:84%
itself and touching itself and
eating itself-- everything.

00:28:54.985 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:90%
But true.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's from the
scientific perspective.

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.650 align:middle line:84%
What's happened is the one
has become conscious of itself

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:90%
through becoming many.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality, the deep myth I've
explored in many of my books,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
such as my books on Gnostic
Christianity and many others,

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
myth, which comes

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
from the other
perspective, is that there

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.750 align:middle line:84%
is a ground of being, the
same, a mystery of being,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
which could be called God
in traditional language,

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:90%
which is like a big mind.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So here we've looked
outwards, and so we

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.830 align:middle line:90%
see it like an object.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a field of energy.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Here we look inwards.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.130 align:middle line:84%
We see the same thing,
but now it looks

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:90%
like a subject, not an object.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a great mind.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the one mind,
big mind, in the Zen

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.315 align:middle line:84%
tradition-- God, awareness
in the Hindu tradition.

00:29:47.315 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:90%
The quantum field.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Quantum field from this
direction, from this direction

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:90%
it's a presence.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a mind within which
all of this is arising.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And the image that's often
used, very powerful-- I use it--

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is that this is like a dream
arising within one big mind.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Lucid living.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
That's part of also
what you teach.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, indeed, although
we'll come back to that.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.316 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back to that,
because I don't want to clutter

00:30:14.316 --> 00:30:15.300 align:middle line:90%
this idea for a moment.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So from this perspective,
you've got the field of being,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
which is a mind, dreaming itself
to be everything and everyone.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And then through the forms that
it's dreaming itself to be,

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
it's conscious.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So the great awareness is
this unconscious being.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.224 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
dream of Brahman,

00:30:33.224 --> 00:30:34.590 align:middle line:84%
as they would say in
the Hindu tradition.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the dream of God.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And through dreaming
this, imagining,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
creating this, all these forms,
which aren't really there

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
but seem as if they are,
that oneness can now

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.160 align:middle line:90%
take a perspective on itself.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.724 align:middle line:84%
Now these are the
same thing from two

00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:90%
different perspectives.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So what can we say
from both perspectives?

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We can say the one is
become conscious of itself

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
through appearing to be
someone, through appearing to be

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:84%
individuals, and
that what we are

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:84%
are like centers
of consciousness

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:90%
within the unconscious field.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
around you now, you

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
will see that the
bench is unconscious,

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:90%
the ground is unconscious.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Most of--

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, not conscious
like we are, let's say.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
everything is actually

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:84%
conscious in its own
way, to be honest.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But in the traditional way in
terms of looking at itself,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.910 align:middle line:84%
doing this, the bench isn't
going to pipe up in a minute

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:90%
and go, actually I disagree.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:90%
You do?

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You disagree?

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.526 align:middle line:84%
This is an interview
with Tim, Bench.

00:31:33.526 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
I'm not conscious?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And will you get off me?

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, but in terms
of like raw matter,

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:84%
you've got something which is
at least relatively unconscious,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
which has developed
into this complex form,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.590 align:middle line:90%
which is now conscious.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.250 align:middle line:84%
That's from the
scientific perspective.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.460 align:middle line:10%
From the other
perspective, there's

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.210 align:middle line:10%
the field, and the same
thing-- through imagining

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:04.125 align:middle line:10%
itself to be these forms,
it has become conscious.

00:32:04.125 --> 00:32:08.420 align:middle line:84%
In both ways, we are
centers of consciousness

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:90%
in the unconscious field.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the question then
becomes, well, how does this--

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.544 align:middle line:90%
Tunes into that?

00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.183 align:middle line:90%
You want me to go for that?

00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:22.599 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-OK.

00:32:22.599 --> 00:32:23.834 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:23.834 --> 00:32:26.370 align:middle line:90%
So here's an image.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just an analogy, shouldn't
be taken too-- pushed too far.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think it
can be insightful.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:84%
For materialists, they have
a whole problem, because they

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:90%
go, well, you're a body.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:84%
They ignore the fact
you're not really there.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You're a body, and
you're conscious,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's something to do with
the piece of complex meat

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.270 align:middle line:90%
in your head.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:84%
The porridge in my head
is somehow conscious.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.970 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows how.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Now clearly, the
brain has something

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to do with consciousness.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if you give me sleeping
pills, I'll fall asleep.

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.147 align:middle line:84%
If you change my chemistry,
I'll fall asleep or hit

00:32:58.147 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:90%
me on the head, and [BABBLES].

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.474 align:middle line:84%
And we've studied the brain
now in great detail and found,

00:33:04.474 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, probe
this, this happens,

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
probe this-- so the brain
is obviously something

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:90%
to do with consciousness.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But we can't find
consciousness in it.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You undo the brain, and you
can't find a single idea.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.199 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's an idea.
No.

00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:90%
All you get is more porridge.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.460 align:middle line:84%
What I think this is
pointing to is that what

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.200 align:middle line:84%
spirituality offers to
this is that the awareness

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.440 align:middle line:90%
isn't in the brain.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.390 align:middle line:90%
The awareness is the field.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.970 align:middle line:84%
The awareness is the
unconscious field.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:39.110 align:middle line:84%
What the brain is doing is
allowing the unconscious field

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:90%
to become conscious.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Here's the analogy.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:53.301 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we are in a
field of music, radio waves.

00:33:53.301 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:84%
All these radio-- I
mean, we've got the birds

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.910 align:middle line:90%
singing here, which is nice.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But we're also-- this air
is full of radio waves.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%
There's [HUMMING]
here, [HUMMING]

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:84%
classical music over
here, and [HUMMING]--

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:90%
all these radio waves.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And where are they?

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.460 align:middle line:90%
We're living in them.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's completely silent.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Can't hear any of them.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:90%
But they're all there.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.195 align:middle line:90%
Including electromagnetics.

00:34:13.195 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the lot, all those
fields, all those fields.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a field of
music, of radio waves.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:90%
But we can't hear it.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.469 align:middle line:90%
Take a radio.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Stick some life in it, some
energy, tune in-- poof--

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.389 align:middle line:84%
and there's this pocket
of sound that will emerge.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.620 align:middle line:90%
There's music.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the music's
not in the radio.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You take the radio to
bits from the transistors,

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:90%
where the fuck-- excuse me.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Where is the--
where's the music?

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Where's the music?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't find the music.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is what
reductionism does.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:49.610 align:middle line:84%
It takes the radio to bits, and
there's no music and no radio.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It's like you've got nothing.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Where's the music?

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the radio.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:90%
The music's everywhere.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.100 align:middle line:84%
The radio is allowing
the music to be heard.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.346 align:middle line:84%
Well, as an analogy,
I think that can

00:35:01.346 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:84%
point to something about
what's happening right now.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.640 align:middle line:90%
The awareness is everywhere.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the great
insight of spirituality.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like a giant mind
within which everything

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:90%
is arising like a dream.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.570 align:middle line:84%
What this is doing is allowing
that to become conscious.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So here's the center
of consciousness,

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
a little bubble of consciousness
within the unconscious field.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And our bubbles of consciousness
have risen together here.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now when we part, mine will
disappear off in my direction,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and yours will disappear
off in your direction,

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and wherever you go,
that center will go.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're centers in
this unconscious field,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:90%
meeting each other.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.100 align:middle line:90%
But what we are is the field.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:84%
What we are is
everywhere, and always.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is the message
of deep spirituality.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:90%
You are a center.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But you are also
the whole field.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You are a center
arising within the field

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and making the
field conscious so

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that you are everywhere
and always if you

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.810 align:middle line:90%
come deep enough into yourself.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
You are the unconscious field.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Or I am the unconscious
field rising as Tim.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You are the unconscious
feel arising as Lilou.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.110 align:middle line:84%
In traditional
language, you'd say,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:90%
you are God arising as Lilou.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I am God arising as Tim.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just different words
to describe the same thing.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Normally, we're just
stuck in the center.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.490 align:middle line:90%
We just think we're this body.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
As you make the journey
to the depths of life,

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:90%
you start to discover, oh, no.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:90%
I am the oneness.

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I am the one arising at someone.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the deep
awake state kicks in.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And when it kicks in, life
becomes more wonderful.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Life becomes wow.

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You just see how incredible
this moment is, every moment is.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.520 align:middle line:10%
So then it becomes about
remembering that or finding

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.170 align:middle line:10%
little tricks to
remember that we can step

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.110 align:middle line:10%
in the mystery of life anytime
until it becomes a habit

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:10%
or something of second nature?

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Because at the beginning as
kids, we need to, of course,

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
learn step by step before
we can fully embrace that

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:90%
and embody that.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd say make a
habit of wondering.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I say that because
that's my habit.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I know.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.930 align:middle line:84%
To me, life seems
worthy of wonder.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:19.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're not wondering, then
you're already unconscious.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
worthy of wonder.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you wonder, you
don't arrive somewhere.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, well,
you've got a practice now

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and you can get there.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you just open
your journey of life up.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So your journey, instead
of being just that journey,

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.920 align:middle line:90%
becomes this journey.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And why it's good
to be in a graveyard

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is because you've got so long
to do this, so why not do it?

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Why not really be alive,
really explore this?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Why not milk it for
everything it's worth?

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, if you wonder,
both in the sense of seeing

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
how wonderful it is and in
terms of questioning your story,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.070 align:middle line:84%
looking deeper, finding
more-- who am I really?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:90%
What is this really?

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, it
will unfold, undoubtedly.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You will learn from others, and
you will discover it yourself.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And you will.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
If you look deeper, you will
find what you're longing for.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look deeper, you will
find what you're longing for.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.086 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
longing for is the depths.

00:38:20.086 --> 00:38:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And let me say why.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I've said used the
words "what you're longing for."

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
important word I haven't

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.485 align:middle line:90%
mentioned-- very important.

00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I hear that,
I hear "purpose" also.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
are looking for their purpose

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and want to contribute
more to life.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully this is
related to your answer.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a heart desire
to contribute on this plant.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are realizing
that we're connected

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and that this Earth
needs our help, too.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And we have a deep longing.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And we have a deep heart
desire that is waking up,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:84%
as we're waking up
ourselves, to contribute,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.410 align:middle line:90%
to give, to connect.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, and then
this is a change

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.780 align:middle line:84%
of tone from where we've
been, but actually it's

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:90%
a paralogical complement of it.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking in
very conceptual terms

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to say the same thing in
much more emotive language.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:84%
What it seems to
me, from my life

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and from being close to so many
other people, we long for love.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And that can sound
trite, but it is true.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.900 align:middle line:90%
We long for love.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience
deep love, we love being,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:90%
we love being alive.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Even when some of it's not
so good, or terrible even,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:90%
we love being.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We love life.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we long to feel.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And this love arises from
the experience of oneness.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:84%
When you love someone,
it's because you

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.790 align:middle line:90%
don't feel separate from them.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:84%
When you love
nature, it's when you

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.510 align:middle line:90%
don't feel separate from it.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.530 align:middle line:84%
When you love what you
do, it's because you

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.980 align:middle line:90%
don't feel separate from it.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
When you make the journey
into the deep self,

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:84%
you discover this field of
being, which is your essence.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You're not separate
from anything.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You are separate here and all
one here at the same time.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And when that oneness and
separateness are there,

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.630 align:middle line:90%
there's this incredible love.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's wow.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the love-- it's just
the whole universe is just

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:84%
pulsating with love, which
is an emotive way of seeing

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:90%
the same thing as oneness.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Because it's how oneness feels.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So why this is so important is
because then we find the love.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Now what is that?

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does
that express itself?

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Because love is a
difficult word sometimes.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Love is a big thing.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Because love is not just
something I want for me.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.600 align:middle line:90%
That's not fully love.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Love is something
which I also give.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.910 align:middle line:90%
It's something I share.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see another
paradoxity, then,

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.960 align:middle line:84%
which is at the heart
of awakening for me

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and missed by a lot of other
spiritual traditions, I think,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
which is self-realization,
discovering who you are,

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:05.870 align:middle line:84%
waking up to this and
experiencing that big love.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And then that love expresses
itself in the world.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's self-realization
and self-expression.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing yourself
and then showing in life.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So you're coming
out, as it were,

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:90%
into this wonderful oneness.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this
all-embracing love,

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.290 align:middle line:84%
which comes through you out
into the appearances, which

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:84%
is service, which
is kindness, which

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is creativity, which
is that longing you

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.100 align:middle line:90%
talk of that we want purpose.

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the deepest purpose
is to learn to love,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is to learn what it is to love,
which is coming back here,

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and then what it
is to express love,

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.310 align:middle line:90%
which is living your life.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And if I have
anything as a working

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
model for the meaning of my
life, it's learning to love.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And that embraces for me all of
this philosophy that I've been

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.180 align:middle line:90%
talking about with science.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:84%
That's all the bedrock
of learning to love.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The journey through
these appearances

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
is discovering that
it's one and separate

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, feeling
connected and in love

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing that
deep love into the world

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and making the world
more beautiful,

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
more kind, a place
for us to live.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we would learn how to
love and love all that is,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.640 align:middle line:84%
then eventually our purpose will
just rise out of that instead

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.330 align:middle line:90%
of it being a thinking game?

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I think thinking's good.
[LAUGHING] We need both.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we try to
find our life purpose so much

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and really like it becomes--
I know a lot of people

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
are just struggling
with it, and they

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:84%
want to-- but it feels to me
and from this conversation,

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:84%
too, that if we
focus on the love

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and loving ourselves
and loving every moment,

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.210 align:middle line:84%
there will be something
that will just be even

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:84%
more juicy, that will
just be like, ah,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.860 align:middle line:90%
I really, really love that.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, let's approach
this paralogically

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and see if it can help.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
paralogical insights

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:84%
would be, OK, so maybe what
we need to do is love being

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and then be loving, OK?

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've been saying, I
think in another language, OK?

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.805 align:middle line:90%
So loving being, being loving.

00:43:17.805 --> 00:43:19.800 align:middle line:90%
We need to those two.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.775 align:middle line:84%
And then this thing of
purpose-- so maybe purpose

00:43:21.775 --> 00:43:25.260 align:middle line:84%
is paralogical, too, in
which case, one would expect

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that there would be
something universal about it

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and then something
individual about it.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at
people and myself,

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.700 align:middle line:90%
that's the way it looks.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a universal
purpose, which

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is true of all of us,
true of life itself,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
which is that life is the one
coming to consciousness as many

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.860 align:middle line:90%
to discover that it's all one.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Or to put that in emotive
language, it's the one,

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
become many, to fall
in love with itself.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:90%
So that applies to all of us.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We're all on a journey of
becoming more conscious,

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.860 align:middle line:84%
which is also
becoming more loving.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
individual expression.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:84%
That universal love is going to
express through this Tim shape.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And Tim has these unique
qualities-- and foibles.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.230 align:middle line:84%
He's this unique, paradoxical
bowl of good qualities

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and bad qualities, and he's
a unique thing in the world,

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:90%
as everyone is.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And if the love
pours though Tim,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:84%
it will have a
particular flavor.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And my flavor is this
philosophy and taking people

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:84%
through these
practices that I teach,

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.050 align:middle line:84%
where they can
experience the love.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:28.840 align:middle line:90%
That's my job.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:90%
You're a stand-up philosopher.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Stand-up philosopher,
and really, honest truth,

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.070 align:middle line:90%
a love junkie, really.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:90%
You're a life lover.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.780 align:middle line:90%
That's for me.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You can't get enough
[INAUDIBLE], can't you?

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.550 align:middle line:84%
A lovely woman at
one of my retreats

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.204 align:middle line:84%
a while back, when I said,
really I'm a love junkie,

00:44:49.204 --> 00:44:50.770 align:middle line:84%
she went, you're not a
junkie, you're a dealer.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:54.450 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a love dealer.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.720 align:middle line:90%
That's really my job.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But that's because of the
particular life I've lived.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Now here are you, and
you have had your life,

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and you're discovering the
same oneness and the same love,

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and then it's coming through
this individual form.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's the same
universal purpose.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And then its
particular expression

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is to be here holding
this microphone,

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.260 align:middle line:84%
being interested in these things
that this mad Englishman has

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.860 align:middle line:90%
got to say.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And each one of us has that.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when we find the love,
we will find the universal,

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll find
the particular.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's different for everyone.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's can seem

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.300 align:middle line:84%
like it's very big and
grand on a world stage,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:39.720 align:middle line:84%
but that's no more significant
than the person who

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.320 align:middle line:90%
is very particular.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:84%
To bring up a child,
what greater-- you know,

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.490 align:middle line:84%
one human being, but to
be so intimately involved

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.450 align:middle line:84%
in bringing another
being into the world

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:59.530 align:middle line:84%
is as big as being heard by a
million people for 10 minutes.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what we do.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that we do what we are
called to with love-- to hold

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.990 align:middle line:84%
the hand of someone
who is dying,

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to be there with our friends,
to be there with ourself,

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.280 align:middle line:84%
to be there caring for
the world-- whatever

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.320 align:middle line:90%
it is that we are drawn to.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And to see that
if each one of us

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.590 align:middle line:84%
finds that universal
love and then finds

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
our universal expression
of it-- sorry,

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.470 align:middle line:84%
individual, particular
expression of it,

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:32.220 align:middle line:84%
then this will move, because
it's universal and particular.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to do.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So the more we come
out to the oneness,

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.300 align:middle line:90%
the more we can come into life.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And the problem
with spirituality

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
is that traditionally
it takes you out

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.340 align:middle line:90%
but doesn't bring you back in.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So you want to find the peace,
but what about the passion?

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.180 align:middle line:84%
You want the stillness,
but what about the action?

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So what we need is one that
goes, yeah, in this moment

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.800 align:middle line:84%
now, there's a deep peace,
and it's arising as passion.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.480 align:middle line:84%
There's something impersonal,
and it's arising as personal.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that what we called
non-duality, too?

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Non-duality is this,
what I call-- you know,

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.610 align:middle line:90%
it's the oneness.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.760 align:middle line:10%
It's where there's
no separateness.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.950 align:middle line:10%
There is no separateness.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.200 align:middle line:10%
That's the wave.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.640 align:middle line:10%
But the wave is also a particle.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to ignore
the particle, either.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to get
stuck in the separateness.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:84%
If you do, life becomes
small, narrow, and confined.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.840 align:middle line:10%
Particles are limited.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what a particle is.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a limit.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.627 align:middle line:90%
You're being a particle?

00:47:25.627 --> 00:47:26.493 align:middle line:90%
I'm being a particle now.

00:47:26.493 --> 00:47:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It's all limited.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But it feels like
that, doesn't it?

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:33.110 align:middle line:84%
When you really get-- when
you think, I'm just Tim,

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:84%
it's like I'm taking the
universal field, which is huge,

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.490 align:middle line:84%
infinite, and I'm trying
to squeeze it inside Tim,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:90%
all that being in Tim.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do
it, the more-- argh.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
being a particle.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It's limit, limit, limit,
limit, limit, until you feel

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.240 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, God, life is so
limited, and I'm so limited,

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's horrible.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you come into the wave,
if you come to the oneness,

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.110 align:middle line:90%
there's no limit.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.645 align:middle line:90%
But don't lose the particle.

00:47:58.645 --> 00:48:02.590 align:middle line:84%
The particle is like the
flower coming out of the Earth.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.180 align:middle line:84%
This, this separateness,
this is where the juice is.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.200 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
can feel things.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:84%
We can hear that bird singing
that song in this moment, where

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.930 align:middle line:84%
we can see this,
breathe this breath,

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and feel the textures of
life, where we can love

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that particular person, not
just everyone, but that person,

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.860 align:middle line:84%
have a special relationship
with that individual child

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.240 align:middle line:90%
or partner or whoever it is.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- we
need to be in both.

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And just to finish, but
I'm sure it encompasses--

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the lucid living, is that being
lucid, I guess living lucidly?

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a bit
more than that.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It is lucid in that
sense of being lucid.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's a really
helpful way of describing

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:84%
experientially what
this deep awake state

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:90%
is so people will get it.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It takes the image that
life is like a dream,

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.570 align:middle line:90%
which it is like a dream.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not a dream, but
it's like a dream.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And it says, well,
think about your dreams.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Because in your dreams,
the world of your dreams

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.090 align:middle line:84%
seems to be there, you
seem to be that person,

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.340 align:middle line:84%
it all seems to be
what it appears to be,

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but when you dream lucidly,
we dream consciously,

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.280 align:middle line:84%
you see it's not what
you thought it was.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You see the paradoxity
of your predicament.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You see that you appear to be
a person in the dream world,

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:90%
but you have a deeper being.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:90%
You're the dreamer.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You are the awareness
within which

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.840 align:middle line:90%
the whole dream is arising.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the dream in
one way, but flip it around,

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and the dream is in you.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And your deep being isn't there
in that center of the person

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.200 align:middle line:90%
in the dream you appear to be.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Your deep being is
everywhere and everything.

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You're still experiencing
the dream from being this,

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:84%
but when you're lucid,
you can see that, really,

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.180 align:middle line:90%
you're not even in the dream.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.430 align:middle line:90%
The dream's in you.

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You are the presence within
which everything is arising.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the same here, right now.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the paradoxity
of our being now.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I appear to be Tim.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm experiencing
this flow of life

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.590 align:middle line:84%
from this perspective
of being Tim.

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But in my deep being is this
the awareness within which

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.220 align:middle line:90%
everything is arising.

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the field of being.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the dreamer.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Which am I?

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm both.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm both at the same time.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So we can dream lucidly,
which is interesting.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Even more interesting,
we can live lucidly so

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.280 align:middle line:90%
that I can be like, ooh, hello.

00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.760 align:middle line:90%
There's the field.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's arising as Tim
meeting Lilou, which

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.673 align:middle line:90%
is the field arising as Lilou.

00:50:53.673 --> 00:50:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds weird,
but it's obvious.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I can look at you
now, and I am seeing the form,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.060 align:middle line:90%
which is gorgeous.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.570 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm connecting
with, I can't see it.

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm connecting with your being.

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So my being, which is coming
through this-- bloopth--

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:90%
is connecting with your being.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Something which can't
be seen is connecting

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.280 align:middle line:84%
through what can be seen.
There we go.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.260 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Tim, it's been awesome to be
with you here today in Holland.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I would love that we summarize
everything that's been said.

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It's been well over
40 minutes now.

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And how could you-- what
are the main points here?

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.480 align:middle line:84%
If we can just-- ank,
ank-- in a little ball.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.421 align:middle line:84%
--[LAUGHING] You really
want the main points?

00:51:46.421 --> 00:51:49.200 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-All that matters is love.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Life is a profound mystery, and
if you go into that mystery,

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I am confident that you
will discover something

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.970 align:middle line:84%
so profoundly simple that
underneath all the complexity,

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:01.570 align:middle line:84%
which is fascinating, and
I love, underneath all

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
the clever ideas, you will
find an absolute mystery,

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and as you come into
that profound mystery,

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:84%
this deep love will
naturally arise,

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and you will fall
in love with being.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you fall in love with
being, love by its very nature

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.390 align:middle line:90%
has to express itself.

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise it's not love.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And you will come back to this
incredible world of complexity

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:84%
with this passion of love
to bring love to the world.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we do that, then this
will be a better place for us

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and our children and
our children's children.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And the process of evolution,
which has been going on

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.220 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, will
continue, will speed up,

00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and we will take this deep
awake, this deep realization

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:51.135 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality
out of this ghetto

00:52:51.135 --> 00:52:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and into the center of
human consciousness.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens--
I don't know when

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:03.340 align:middle line:84%
or-- it could be
soon, maybe not.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.840 align:middle line:84%
We may be planting seeds now
for our children's children.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.910 align:middle line:84%
But when it happens, my guess
is it'll be like the Berlin

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Wall coming down.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
It'll seem like we're
just stuck and we're stuck

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're stuck, and then
one day, the separateness

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:90%
will come down.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go, oh, so a lot of us
were thinking this, a lot of us

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:23.010 align:middle line:90%
were realizing this.

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And now we can openly
talk about that.

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I want, and what
I think you're doing,

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is enabling that to happen, that
we can see that we're evolving

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and that if we can
just keep it going,

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:84%
something magic is
going to happen.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, Tim.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
this juicy conversation.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.765 align:middle line:84%
And much love, much
love from Holland.

00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:49.267 align:middle line:90%
Much love from Holland.
