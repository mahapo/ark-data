[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.768 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my beautiful
co-creators.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.090 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Today I'm in Windsor.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in Windsor in the UK.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't get enough, and
today I have a house author,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Derek, hello.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Lilou.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.427 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:00:22.427 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm very good indeed.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.975 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:90%
I love the British accent.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Very blessed to be here.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.290 align:middle line:84%
We are blessed to
have you, and I'm

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:84%
excited to discover
your story because I

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
know you're an international
motivational speaker

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and a coach.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And you just got this book out,
so it's brand new material.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
be discovering this

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
as you are throughout this
interview of what you do

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and what got you
to write this book

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.676 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, happy to share.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:52.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll just go for it.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:90%
So what got you to start it?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
What is this-- I've
heard of this 10

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:90%
seconds that change your life.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:10%
My book's called the
"10-Second Philosophy,"

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:10%
which is really
a practical guide

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:10%
to releasing your inner genius.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.085 align:middle line:10%
It really starts
because I believe

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
that everyone has a
genius inside of them

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:10%
which I call the true self.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you get the true
self into your life,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll appear like a
genius because there

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:90%
is a genius inside all of us.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it can take just seconds
to open up that genius

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and then change your whole life.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into it.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into how to do that
because it's true like now

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
in life we don't have
much time to bring

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that genius out and
have those answers

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and make those decisions.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.335 align:middle line:84%
So how can we tap into
that really quickly.

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, it started for me
going back eight years ago.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I was in my office
working late one night.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had been working
for about 18 years

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
as a financial services
financial planner,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and effectively, I
had been failing.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
For the agency
that I worked for,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I was always at the
bottom of the list

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
struggling after 18
years in the business

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
just about making ends
meet, not doing very well.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And to be frank, after
18 years, I had no money.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I was broke, and I was
not quite depressed,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:84%
but I'd say I was
clinically unhappy.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:10%
So I was in the office one
night one evening at 9:30,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:10%
and this [INAUDIBLE] guy
came into the office.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:10%
And he just said to me,
Derek, time to lock up.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just give me 10 more
minutes, and he walked away,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
and then he came back in.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just give
me two more minutes.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he just looked at me,
and he asked me a question.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Derek, what time
did you get in this morning?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, 8 o'clock.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:10%
And literally as
he walked away, I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:10%
stood then-- I had
a moment, which

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:10%
is my first 10-second moment
because in those 10 seconds

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:10%
I literally stopped
and went inside, really

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:10%
went introspectively.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And what came out of me was,
you're not happy because you're

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
not who you really are.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:90%
And you can't be truly happy.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not you.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:10%
What also came out of me
was some revelations for me

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:10%
at the time, which is I have
been setting goals for 18

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:10%
years, doing the goal thing, as
you've all been taught to do,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:10%
for 18 years.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And after years, I was still
broke, and I was still unhappy.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.710 align:middle line:10%
So what came out me was
to stop setting goals,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:10%
stop setting goals, and instead
start setting standards for how

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:10%
to live your life by the day.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:10%
So I did that.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:10%
And just for clarification,
a goal of course

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:10%
is something that you set
up for tomorrow, next week,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:10%
next month, next year,
20 years into the future.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I understood for
myself and then for the people

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is that we all attach some of
our happiness and contentment

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to achieving of that goal.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:10%
So that happiness and
contentment stays in the future

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:10%
with that goal, but most
goals are not achieved,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:10%
so people never
get the happiness

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:10%
really in their lives.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:90%
A standard is different.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
A standard says this is who
I'm going to be just for today.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am today.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:84%
These are the basis,
the criteria, the rules,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.130 align:middle line:84%
the levels, and the
qualities that I'm

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:90%
going to live by today.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And they don't come
from outside of you,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
they come from inside of you.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:10%
So for me, a quality, a level,
a rule, a basis, a criteria

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:10%
is something that says, who
am I really on the inside?

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Who's the person inside?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
What's my true self?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And to listen to the standards,
the qualities, rules,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
criterias, levels, and base
that come from that place

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and commit to living up
to the standards just one

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
day at a time just
for today just

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.309 align:middle line:84%
until you hit your head
back on your pillow tonight,

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think we can all do that.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We can all be ourselves, be our
true self, just for one day.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you say to me do this
for the rest of your life

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
over a 20-year business plan
or a three-year goal, it's

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:84%
difficult. I was going
to leaders and teachers

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
from them around the world
and have all had challenges

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:90%
with goals themselves.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
So what we do know is that goals
are challenging for everyone,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and most people can either
take it to another place

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
if they set standards, and
goals sometimes just don't work.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:90%
So I know this is different.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.881 align:middle line:84%
I know it's controversial, but
actually it's changing lives

00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and so did mine.
So that night--

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, let's bring
it back to your life

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:10%
because it really helps
us because otherwise

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:10%
I just heard a lot of things.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it's wonderful when
we can just reflect in here

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
how this is, yeah, wonderful.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.975 align:middle line:10%
I mean really
simply, the place I

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:10%
was in just going back
just over seven years ago

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:10%
where I wasn't
seeing my children.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.770 align:middle line:10%
I was married.
I have four children.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't seeing them.
I was always working.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't seeing my wife.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It was affecting
our relationships

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
with my wife and my children.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't happy in the office,
unhappy with people driving all

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:10%
over the country to see
people who didn't have

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:10%
much money for
financial planning

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:10%
and really just going
wherever they said set up.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
If they asked me to go to
the north or the south,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I would go, anytime,
anyplace, anywhere.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that
was I was so desperate

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and happy and
actually really just

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:90%
struggling to have any success.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:10%
So after my change,
my epiphany-- that's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:10%
even if I want to call
it that-- literally,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:10%
everything changed for
me because I changed.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:10%
I set standards,
and that evening

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.085 align:middle line:10%
what I did I from inside I wrote
out some new standards to how

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:00.690 align:middle line:10%
I was going to be as a person.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Because what did you
reply to that guy.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my reply to him
was actually nothing.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
But he was already walking away.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my moment, he
was already walking away.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
But that phrase, that
question, just went inside.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, all of us
have moments that pass us by.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe my moment
took me about 10 seconds

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
to have someone ask me a
question and have me go inside

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and answer that
question honestly

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
perhaps for the first time.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And that question changed me.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that any word,
thought, question, phrase,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:84%
or idea can change us if we
stop, pause, and allow it to go

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:90%
inside and work inside of us.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So an idea that, and one
of the things that came out

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.897 align:middle line:84%
was around standards,
and that was

00:06:41.897 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:90%
what came out of my philosophy.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It was around standards, and
I set standards in my life

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
around the business.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't see any clients
below a certain wealth

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
because it was honoring them,
but it wasn't honoring me.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't doing
much money from it.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no kind
of effect of that,

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
so I wasn't seeing my
wife or my children.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I set a minimum
criteria for clients

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:90%
must have to be clients of mine.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.091 align:middle line:84%
I also decided no more six
days a week and no more

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:90%
evening appointments.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So from a practical
point of view,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:90%
I began to reclaim my life.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And the core standard was
around my family standards.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So taking my children to
school became my new standard

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:90%
every single morning.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Picking my children
up from school three,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.180 align:middle line:10%
four nights a week every single
week became another standard.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
No more Fridays, no
Saturdays, half day Wednesday.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
I even made a decision
around the people

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
I would work with as I was
advising that would have to be,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
what I would call, nice people,
people I felt a connection

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
with, because I wasn't
going to be in a place

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:84%
where I would be seeing
people in my office,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.551 align:middle line:84%
but then still feeling
uncomfortable dealing

00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I made a decision that I would
deal with people I wanted

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.655 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, who
I knew connected

00:07:45.655 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
with me, who I
connected with them,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:90%
and that they were nice people.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
That sounds an
odd phrase to use,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
but I've been messed around and
abused so much over the years

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
by clients, I made a decision.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.515 align:middle line:84%
All my clients must
be nice people.

00:07:57.515 --> 00:08:00.187 align:middle line:84%
I must want to work with them
and feel that connection.

00:08:00.187 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And something else that
really changed my life

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:84%
was to make the decisions
that all clients

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
must come to my office no matter
where they were in the country.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
They must come to me, so
made lots of standards

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
around my lifestyle and
who I was as a person,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:90%
and it just changed everything.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Quite literally change--
my relationships, obviously

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
my children, my wife,
they all improved.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:90%
They all got better.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I felt better as a person
because I felt real.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I felt this is really
me living my life.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
What I've noticed is up
until that point in my life

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.490 align:middle line:84%
my standards were
set by the business,

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:90%
the community, my clients.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Someone said 10 years ago,
the industry, the economy,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
set by these different
areas that weren't me.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:84%
For the very first
time in my life

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I started to stop and go
inside and set standards

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:84%
for who I really
was as a person,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and that made all
the difference.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So from that point onwards, my
life changed so dramatically.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
People began to turn up
and say, what did you do?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.127 align:middle line:84%
Because you were doing this
bad for 18 years, and I

00:09:00.127 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:84%
didn't quite.
I was famous for my persistence.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.445 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't quit.

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
But how could you be so bad
for so long then suddenly

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
virtually overnight--
it's not an exaggeration--

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:90%
overnight things changed?

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And they changed overnight
because I changed.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Between those 10 seconds, I
became a different person.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.625 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it took time,
weeks and months and a couple

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
of years, to see the
results in the business,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
but the result was
guaranteed because I changed.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but why did
it not happen before?

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we all see
this, and there's

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:84%
years and years and
years of sometimes

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:84%
procrastinating and
saying, [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:90%
until there is a sudden event.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:10%
Or we get fired, or
there is a disease,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:10%
or there's something
really dramatic.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So why didn't you hear this
before or had this moment?

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:90%
What does create such a moment?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I think what the
reality of it is

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd had plenty of
messages from the universe

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:90%
to say, stop what you're doing.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
This isn't working
for you, and because I

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
was trapped in what I call
non-self, or in the world,

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I ignored them.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I think we all do in life
have times and messages

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.345 align:middle line:84%
that we pick up from the
universe, a word, a thought,

00:10:02.345 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
a question, [INAUDIBLE],
an incident,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:90%
and we do nothing with it.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't allow it to
work inside of us,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
so we don't get the
change because I look back

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and I had plenty of moments.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:10%
I tell you one
night I was actually

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:10%
driving back from a
client's late one night

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:10%
and I driving my car.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.005 align:middle line:10%
And it was probably about
10:00, 10:30 in the evening,

00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:10%
and all I wanted to do
was just to get home

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:10%
to see my wife before she went
to bed, maybe look at the kids

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:10%
before I went to bed.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.646 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew I wouldn't see
them the next morning because

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:90%
be up before they were up.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So what actually happened
is I'm driving along,

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm looking at
the car in front.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And the car in front
is driving so slowly.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, why is he driving
so slowly, I need to get home.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:10%
So I put my foot
down to overtake him,

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:10%
and it's only when I crashed
into the motorway barrier

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.985 align:middle line:10%
and bounced back that I realized
I was already in the fast lane.

00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I was so tired I
didn't know I was

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:90%
already in the overtaking lane.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And thank God there
wasn't a truck behind.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't anything
that, otherwise I wouldn't

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%
be literally here today.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But I had lots of little signals
and a lot of big signals,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
pay attention to them.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:10%
So what I realized was that
sometimes it just takes

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.400 align:middle line:10%
a moment, or a word, or
a thought, or a question,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:10%
or a phrase, or an idea
just to get us to pause.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And thank God that
night in November, 2003,

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I took that question from
an office security guard.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:90%
I call him my first coach.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know this
because the office

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
suit guards change so often,
but he just asked a question.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
He was new to the building,
and I just said to him,

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:90%
now give me some more time.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But when he asked that
question, it just made me stop.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes to find the
philosophy and the truth that's

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:10%
inside of us, we've got to just
stop for a moment and pause

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:10%
and allow the phrase or
the question to sink in

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:10%
and to see what comes
from that place.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
you want to know what

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:90%
my life looked like after that?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, so--

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Right, and there's
a [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, but basically I
don't know how relevant it is

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
because working as
a financial planner

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and just paying your
bills each month

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is not very inspirational
for your clients.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not good for you.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And your colleagues don't
think very highly of you.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you
is within three years

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
from that being broke and
just paying the bills,

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a millionaire.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.495 align:middle line:84%
The following year, I
made a million dollars

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.981 align:middle line:84%
in just that year, and I did
it working less than half

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the time.
-It's a big change.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Yes, big change because it was
around saying, OK, standards.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It's as if when I set standards
that my truth began to speak

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to the world because
what I can tell

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
you is this is that the company
I worked for didn't change.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:90%
The products didn't change.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The presentation, the slides
were pretty much the same.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:90%
That didn't change.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:84%
About the hotel using
for presentations,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:90%
that didn't change either.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:40.800 align:middle line:10%
What changed was me, and what
I can't yet put into words even

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:10%
now, but I do fancy
that what was happening,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.160 align:middle line:10%
is when people were meeting
me, they were feeling me

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:10%
and seeing me differently.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:10%
And because they were picking up
on a different energy or aspect

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:10%
of me unconsciously,
they were going,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:10%
I'll do business with him.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll connect with this person.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll introduce him to so-and-so.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:84%
These were essentially the
same people who, for 18 years,

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get a meeting with
or had a first meeting with.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get a
second meeting with.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So what essentially
happened is people turned up

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
in such great numbers
that I had to then ask

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
other people in the
organization, other agents,

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to help me to service
those clients.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Then something else happened.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the results
came, you know,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
living in the business world,
I had my first waking up, which

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:90%
had occurred to me that night.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Other agents kept approaching
me and saying, Derek, we

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:27.780 align:middle line:90%
now you're bad.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.387 align:middle line:84%
We know you're not
very good at this job,

00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
but you're suddenly
turning your life

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
from being really, really
bad to exceptionally good,

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
one of the top 1%
in the UK and then

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:90%
one of the top 1% in the world.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
How did you do that?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:10%
Because I became a member
of the Top of the Table,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:10%
which is the highest level of
the Million Dollar Round Table,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.570 align:middle line:10%
which is an organization
that represents

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:10%
financial planners, financial
advisers, and wealth

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:10%
managers around the world.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So what was interesting
is that they

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
kept turning up and saying,
well, what did you do?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:10%
And to be frank, when they first
turned up, I started saying,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:10%
well, I wasn't myself.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I found my true self.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I accessed all of that, and
I had the guts to be who

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I really was into the world.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of them got it,
but a lot of them

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't get in because
they were the left

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
brain-conscious busy people.
Show me the number.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Show me the process.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's where my genius
came back into play because I

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.647 align:middle line:84%
believe that every one of us
has a genius inside of a us,

00:14:20.647 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and when we access it,
it gives us the answers.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%
It shows us the way.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:90%
It gives us the ideas.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:90%
It even gives us the words.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.225 align:middle line:84%
So I began to say,
OK, what this is

00:14:31.225 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:90%
you know you're setting goals.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.043 align:middle line:84%
And you're here because
you're not really that happy

00:14:34.043 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and you're not that
successful according to you.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I said that I stopped
setting goals.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do
is set standards.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Now to a left brain
business-conscious

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
person, that looks like,
oh, it's another process

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:90%
like setting goals.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it
wasn't because what

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
standards are is a thing that
comes from the inside of you.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:10%
So they started
setting standards,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:10%
reviewing their old standards.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:10%
And setting new
standards, and to do

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:10%
that, they had to go inside.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
like a miracle to me

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to have people coming in looking
for process in the business

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.984 align:middle line:84%
model, suddenly go
setting standards,

00:15:05.984 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and so you don't do
get your standards

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world,
that's why you're not happy.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why you haven't got
success that you desire.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
You take a stance
from the inside

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%
by an internal reference.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, the
magic was having people

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
coming in for a
result on that process

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and having them turn around
and go, here's how I feel.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
This is really-- I
feel connected here.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And they talk about their
wife and their children

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:10%
and their husband and
things [INAUDIBLE] feelings

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.315 align:middle line:10%
with clients and having
a better connection

00:15:32.315 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:10%
and feeling more honest
and more truthful.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And that clearly
was my resonance.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
So it was a joy.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:10%
It was a revelation to me, sort
of the same thing that worked

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:10%
for me, having standards
take people inside to access

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:10%
their true self and to have the
guts to follow the advice that

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:10%
came from true self.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:10%
Because what happens is that
when you access your true self,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:10%
the more access it,
the more it speaks to,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:10%
the more message it
gives you, the more truth

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:10%
it reveals to you.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:10%
And it does that
through words, thoughts,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:10%
questions, phrases, and ideas
that come from within to share.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
dialogue like, or how do

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
you formulate those standards?

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.110 align:middle line:84%
How do you get in
there to get them out?

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:10%
Actually, the funny thing
is the very first night,

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:10%
it was completely accidental.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:10%
It was just a question
that called me.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it's a
question that caused me

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.834 align:middle line:10%
almost like a mini meditation.

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:10%
Because I remember in the
office when I was there,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:10%
and I literally just
stopped, and I paused

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:10%
and feeling really, really
centered and really comfortable

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:10%
but knowing that
something tremendous

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:10%
was going on inside of me.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:10%
But it was knowing
that my consciousness

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:10%
was really within.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:10%
I was looking deeply
introspectively.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.260 align:middle line:10%
So even though I wouldn't have
called it that then-- I would

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:10%
have just called
it a moment-- it

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:10%
was like doing a
deep meditation,

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.480 align:middle line:10%
instant meditation going
in for a few seconds

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:10%
and holding that place.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:10%
And as I held that place.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:10%
What came up, I paid
attention to it.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So it is about going
inside, allowing the words,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.360 align:middle line:10%
thoughts, question,
phrase to take

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:10%
you inside like a meditation.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:10%
And then to hold that
place, and then just pause

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:10%
and see what comes up from
the core of you to say,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.310 align:middle line:10%
here's what you should do
and to follow that guidance.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:10%
You should really
want to call the book,

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:10%
the strap line is the
practical guide to releasing

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:10%
your inner genius
because what I do

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
know is that every single
person has that inside of them,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:10%
but it starts by stopping,
by pausing, and looking

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:10%
introspectively, and
accepting yourself

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:10%
in the now, not for tomorrow,
not even for tomorrow morning,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:10%
in the now because standards
are now experience.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.373 align:middle line:10%
So as we guided by what's inside
of us, maybe in the early days,

00:17:39.373 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:10%
we don't pay attention, but as
we do it more and more often

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:10%
and practice going inside and
pausing and holding that place,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:10%
we get much more guidance
and much more often.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing to
do is to stop, pause,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:10%
look and go introspectively.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:10%
So one of the processes
I did with the people

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:10%
that I started coaching
was to say, well,

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.860 align:middle line:10%
where did your old
standards come from?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.224 align:middle line:10%
And most people, of course, go
I didn't know I not standards.

00:18:05.224 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:10%
Of course, everybody
does, but they

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:10%
don't know because
it's not articulated,

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:10%
at least not in this world.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:10%
So what are the
terms that you have,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.750 align:middle line:10%
and where do they
come from, so I

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.500 align:middle line:10%
have this process of looking at
seven key areas of your life.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:10%
So I was able to, by doing
it on myself for those years,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:10%
to refine the key
areas, and everything

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:10%
affects everything else.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:10%
So the seven areas are your
personal health and fitness,

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:10%
and the money I created to that
called PERFECT, P-E-R-F-E-C-T.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And the P is personal
health and fitness.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
E is your environment, which is
your internal environment, how

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you think in you
approach inside.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And R is your, sorry,
this, the second part of E,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:90%
is your external environment.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:10%
It's what you take in
from your environment,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:10%
from the news and the radio
and people you associate with,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:10%
and the newspapers,
everything that's around

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:10%
that you allow into your mind.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.345 align:middle line:84%
We know people, both of
us know people, who wake

00:18:59.345 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
up in the morning to the radio.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:10%
And the radio news
comes on, and it

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:10%
dumps into their minds
first thing, at the box,

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:10%
straightaway, dumps in the
war, the death, the tragedy,

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:10%
the murder, the economy,
straightaway, that's

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.345 align:middle line:10%
how they start their day.

00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:10%
It'd be like starting
your day with a cigarette,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and that's not a great way
to start the day, is it?

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.710 align:middle line:10%
So that dumps in, so
we need to control

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:10%
our internal
environment and also

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:10%
our external, what we allow in.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:10%
So that's the E of perfect.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:10%
R is relationships, and that's
really simple because we all

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:10%
know-- all of us of any
age, the people we associate

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:10%
with in business and in life,
socially and otherwise, affect

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:10%
our lives.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:10%
My father is an immigrant from
Jamaica to England, came when

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:10%
he was a boy with his parents.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
But there's a couple
of rules he gave us.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And just to kind of let you
know that when I was 13,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:10%
my mother died.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm one of seven, and my mother
died, and my father was left

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:10%
on his own to bring us all up.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:10%
But he had some
really simple rules,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:10%
and I'll share two
of them with you.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:10%
One of the rules was we
must drop the company.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:10%
If he saw us with anyone
even thought might lead us

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:10%
in the wrong
direction or take us

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:10%
away from who we really were,
he'd say, drop the bad company.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:10%
My father was quite a stern man,
as in you had to listen if he

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.870 align:middle line:10%
said, drop the bad company.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:10%
Leave that friend alone.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Don't bring them back
to our house again.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:10%
We had to listen.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if a friend
came to the house to my father

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
would, again, treat
them cordially.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
when they left the house,

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.645 align:middle line:90%
I'd wait for the verdict.

00:20:24.645 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And he might just say, Derek,
that boy's got good manners.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You can bring him there again.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
You must keep good company.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:10%
So he didn't call
it a standard then,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:10%
but we both know that the
standard of our relationships

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:10%
can make us or break us.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:10%
So we can start paying
attention again, saying,

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.177 align:middle line:10%
who's with us in our life
that serves us and honors us

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:10%
and that we can honor and we
mutually honor one another.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.975 align:middle line:84%
And we all know the
detractors in our lives,

00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and if we continue
those associations,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.704 align:middle line:84%
it may take us into
the wrong place for us.

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not a judgement on them.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just about is this
right and honoring us.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:90%
So the F is around family.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.600 align:middle line:10%
So you heard some
of the new standards

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.050 align:middle line:10%
I set around my family
time, what we would do,

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:10%
the quality of our life,
and the time together.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:10%
And that to me was a core
of my standard review.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:10%
Then there was the emotions.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:10%
By now, most people here
we are in our 21st century,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:10%
we know that most of our
emotions, we do them.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:10%
They don't do us.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:10%
But the question
is what standards

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:10%
are we doing each day?

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:10%
What standards of emotions
are we emoting each day?

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:10%
Are we letting the world
control our emotions?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Are we choosing them?

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Are we staying in
control of them?

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's one way to drive
you radically near us

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
or cut us up in the car,
and we get angry and--

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.962 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.962 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:90%
You know, a worse side effect.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
we really get angry.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're
controlling our emotions

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
where, as a
passenger in the car,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
we know that the driver
hasn't got to get angry.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.205 align:middle line:84%
It is a choice, and most of
our emotions, we know by now,

00:21:53.205 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
are choices, but we have a
different standard of choosing.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's about setting
new standards.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing
about setting standards

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is that, yeah, I'm going
to choose a new standard

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
of emoting forever.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just for today.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Can I do this and hold the
standard from inside myself,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.565 align:middle line:84%
can I hold this standard
just until my head

00:22:10.565 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:90%
is back on my pillow tonight?

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
could all do that.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:10%
So then after E, we
have c, which is career,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:10%
make a choice
around the standards

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:10%
that meets clients
as of working.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
The power I gave
away from myself.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:90%
Tremendous power.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.539 align:middle line:84%
That's the main.
Yeah.

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:27.830 align:middle line:84%
That is the main
thing, especially

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
when you're self-employed
or entrepreneurial

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:90%
or starting out.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But even if you're employed, if
you're in an employed position,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
you're there for 10, 15 years,
and you're really unhappy.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Whether we like to or
not, we have to accept

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:90%
that we have set standards.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:90%
We rely on someone to do that.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
We set the rule because
we said actually I'm

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
not to be treated
like that or work

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
in that environment, a
new rule, a new standard,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:90%
or we can change straight away.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So standards are a
narrow experience.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the C of perfect,

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
it's around setting new
standards for your life,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:90%
your career, or even your job.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:90%
And that leads onto time.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:90%
The T is time.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Now for some people
actually, time

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
could be a new standard of time
keeping, being on time or quiet

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
literally getting to meeting
early as a new standard

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:84%
as a rule or a new
quality that they have.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But actually, for me when
I started reviewing around

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
my time, it was around
my time on Earth,

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.740 align:middle line:84%
my time in this physical
sphere because what

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.965 align:middle line:84%
I realized was that for 18 years
as an adult, I wasn't happy.

00:23:29.965 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I was
broke is an issue,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
but the fact was I was
unhappy, and I could only

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.230 align:middle line:84%
find my happiness by finding my
true self because most people

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:84%
in the world I believe are
not happy because they're not

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
who they truly are,
and you just can't

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.890 align:middle line:90%
be truly happy if it's not you.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest revelation
for me was to find me,

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and that then led to
questions such as why am I me,

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and why am I here as me?

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.136 align:middle line:90%
So I began to realize

00:23:57.136 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:90%
The who am I.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, the who am I question
and why am I here question.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that
is kind of introspection

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.060 align:middle line:90%
and constant review.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It was actually some
of my old standards.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Just when they weren't
serving me in the slightest.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I just picked them
up from the employer

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
of the company, the process,
some friends of mine.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And I picked up all these.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:10%
And I realized, but why am
I actually on this planet?

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that became
the question for me.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Why am I really here?

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So the realization
was a little thing

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I worked out called
realize squared,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and realize squared
is quite simple.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Realize squared is there
are two realizations,

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:90%
and one multiplies the other.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The first realization
is a rule here.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.375 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what we believed
we were before we were born,

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:84%
or how from the
point of conception

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:84%
or the point of birth or
some point before that,

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I have some beliefs,
but I don't really know.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what we
go onto afterwards,

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:84%
but I have some beliefs
about that, but none of us

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.170 align:middle line:90%
actually knows.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:10%
But here's what I do know,
and I began to realize,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:10%
we are here in these physical
bodies on a physical plane,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:10%
so why?

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So the thing around time is,
OK, setting standards around why

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:90%
you believe you are hear.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
So how'd you do that.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:10%
The first realization
is you go inside,

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:10%
and you keep going
inside, and you

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:10%
keep looking to realize what's
inside of you, what gifts,

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:10%
abilities, talents,
potentials, intentions did

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:10%
you come here with.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.870 align:middle line:84%
What did you come here
with, and keep looking.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.725 align:middle line:90%
That isn't just done for today.

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:10%
That's done tomorrow and
for the rest of our lives.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Keep looking inside to
realize what's inside of me.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.570 align:middle line:10%
And as I began to do that,
another question came to me.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that have
stuff is inside

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:90%
of me, why is it inside of me.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And the response to
that was really simple,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
to get it outside of me.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have those
abilities and gifts and talents

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that we all have inside if not
to get them outside in love

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and in benefits for the world.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So the second
realization became,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, whatever is inside of me,
I must realize it in the world.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I make it real, so realize
what's inside of you.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Discover, find out for
the rest of your life.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Realize what's inside, and
then make it real in the world.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be there
if not to make it real?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
realize squared came from.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So my time on the
perfect setting standards

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is begin set standards based
on why you think you here

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:84%
and then to be true
to yourself and set

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:84%
standards around,
OK, if that's what

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.996 align:middle line:90%
you're hear for, act as that.

00:26:17.996 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I hear a little baby in the
background, and I'm thinking--

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:84%
no, but I'm thinking this
whole experience of growing

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:90%
up and how we just like--

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Indeed we're talking about
rebirth and babies and crying,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's funny that
you said that though

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because what I realize
is that inside of us,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.411 align:middle line:90%
there is maybe just a baby.

00:26:37.411 --> 00:26:39.295 align:middle line:84%
He's definitely
screaming very loud.

00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:41.175 align:middle line:10%
He's trying to send
us all a message,

00:26:41.175 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:10%
and that's to wake up and spend
some time because funny thing

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:10%
is when I realize
that by going inside

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:10%
and you discover your true self,
you have to nurture that just

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.695 align:middle line:10%
like you would nurture a baby.

00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to nurture that and
grow and look after and care

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and protect it because
that's the real you,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.240 align:middle line:84%
growing and developing
there and crying sometimes

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and giggling sometimes.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But that's the real
you that's inside,

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and if you had a
baby in your hands,

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:90%
you'd nurture that wouldn't you.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the real- you grow
as your genius starts serving

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.770 align:middle line:84%
you and feeding you and
look after you with words

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and inspirations and ideas.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And that changes your life
because when you change,

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
everything changes for you,
and that's what it's about,

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:84%
you finding the
change inside of you

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.260 align:middle line:90%
and all those things changing.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And often when people speak
about their inner child,

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
yes, they are there to nurture
that inner child because it

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been really listened to.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
All we did is absorb and
get all those publicity

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and those advertisers and the
messages and kind of dream

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.540 align:middle line:84%
like if it was our
dream, but it's not.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:84%
We have each our own
dream and capacity,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and do you think we
all are that unique?

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm actually convinced
this every single one of us,

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:10%
every soul on the planet
is not only unique,

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:10%
but also has that oneness.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Every soul on the planet
is part of everything

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:84%
as in we're all
connected together.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know that is a
common way of thinking

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and believing for
those who are awake

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.710 align:middle line:90%
or we might say enlightened.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I genuinely believe that
we're all connected together.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
What I also believe is
that because of that,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
because we're all part of the
same thing-- we're all energy,

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and we're all love.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:84%
This energy is intelligent,
and its purpose is love.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But I generally believe that we
come into this physical plane

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
to experience, to
play, to have fun,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to learn, and to
share, and to help

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
other-- in telling the
souls of the beings

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.960 align:middle line:90%
on this physical plane.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So every single
person comes here,

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and when we shuffle
off this mortal coil,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:90%
we go onto something else.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And whatever that
is, what I know

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we all have the ability
therefore to be whatever

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:90%
you want to be in this world.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:10%
So we come here with a call
to us, but you put it really,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.590 align:middle line:10%
really well when you
say, the world conspires

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.100 align:middle line:10%
to hold us against ourselves.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:10%
The adverse, the teaching,
the newspapers, the economy

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.220 align:middle line:10%
conspires to have
us not be there.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And we start defending
ourselves because our true self

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:90%
is with us as a baby.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:21.975 align:middle line:84%
It's with us as
young child, and do

00:29:21.975 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:84%
we notice as we get
to teenage years,

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:90%
we start defending ourselves?

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:10%
And the real fall for us all
comes when we stop defending

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:10%
ourselves, and we give
in, and we become what we

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:10%
think the world wants us to be.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I call non-self.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.880 align:middle line:10%
And in non-self, you can't truly
be happy because inside of you,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.380 align:middle line:10%
inside of all of us, we
know there's something else

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:10%
there that's really true to us.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:10%
So I'm guided to help others to
find that place inside of them

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:10%
and then have the courage
because it's all well and good

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:10%
saying to someone, find
yourself and be your true self,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:10%
but it's difficult isn't
it in the real world when

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:10%
people saying, well,
to criticize you

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:10%
and observe what you're doing.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would say,
what are you doing?

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You might feel
embarrassed or humiliated

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:84%
or strange or
different or crazy,

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but you know, when
this life ends,

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:84%
all that will mean
nothing at all.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
What really will have
mattered did you get

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:90%
your internal expression out?

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
You did you get your
true self into the world?

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Who'd want to be on their death
bed at 102 and at that point

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:84%
be saying to themselves,
I didn't quite

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:90%
get myself into the world.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:90%
I didn't quite live my life.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm going
onto who knows

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
where, knowing that
when I came here with

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:90%
is still inside of me.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We want to get that thing, our
true self, outside of ourselves

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and express that in the world.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So for all of us, and
certainly for me and people

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with and
coached and spoken four,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:84%
it became, well,
how do I do this.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So I remember
those-- Steven Jobs.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and Steven Jobs
founded Apple and Pixar,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and he did the Stanford
address a few years ago.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:10%
And I know that
Stanford address,

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was really
interesting what he said

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:10%
and also what he didn't
say because as he did this,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:10%
he made this address.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.240 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, let's look
at some of the facts, one

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:10%
of the world's richest men,
one of the most creative men

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:10%
in the world, and pretty
much, at that point addressing

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.270 align:middle line:10%
the Stanford graduating class,
had the world and the future

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:10%
of the world-- they
call it the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and the whys of the world
in his hands, in his grasp.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at
what he actually did.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.300 align:middle line:10%
What he actually did,
he told three stories

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:10%
about his life, three stories.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
He didn't give a
business process.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.157 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say, follow
this model, XYZ, 1 on 1--

00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:47.990 align:middle line:90%
he didn't do any of that.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.510 align:middle line:84%
He gave three
stories of his life,

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and then he said-- and I'm
paraphrasing-- and he said,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.330 align:middle line:84%
there's something inside
of you that knows you

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
better than you know yourself.
It's you heart.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It's your intuition,
and to follow

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:90%
that heart and intuition.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:84%
To learn to drown out the
outer voices, the voice

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that would confuse
you, and to pay

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:90%
attention to the inner voice.

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And he also said
that in his life,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.100 align:middle line:84%
listening to the inner voice,
it has never let him down.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.106 align:middle line:84%
He had always been
guided by that.

00:32:16.106 --> 00:32:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Now that's all sounds
wonderful and great,

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:10%
and I can accept that.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.690 align:middle line:84%
What I think the bigger message
is that he said that instead

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:84%
of a business model for success,
that he said that in terms

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
of how to be happy and
find out who you are,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:84%
that he said that in
terms of a message

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to people that are in
their heads, the academics.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:10%
He said that was the message.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:10%
Find yourself.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.760 align:middle line:10%
It's your story.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:10%
This is your path.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.090 align:middle line:10%
Here are my three stories.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:10%
Here's my path, and
here's what you can do.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:90%
It's your inner self.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I picked
upon that, which

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.555 align:middle line:84%
was only last November,
because obviously it

00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:90%
was after his death.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It went on YouTube
and fire on YouTube.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.480 align:middle line:10%
I thought, isn't that
interesting because I've

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:10%
been writing for these
years around help people

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.190 align:middle line:10%
find themselves and to
listen to the inner voice

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.470 align:middle line:10%
and to be guided by that
and to have the guts

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:10%
and to have the courage
to be who you really

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:10%
are because once
you shuffle off,

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.980 align:middle line:10%
you can't be who you
are after you've gone.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about now and doing it now.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Steve Job, whoa.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:18.790 align:middle line:10%
And but it's been online
for quite some time.

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Yes actually, I
hadn't picked up on.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.330 align:middle line:10%
I picked up on that actually
in November of last year

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.390 align:middle line:10%
because I had it from every
other friend after his death

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.880 align:middle line:10%
obviously, and it went round.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, well, apart
from this chap is a genius.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I just thought,
well, that is it.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.736 align:middle line:10%
But the message for
me was about the words

00:33:36.736 --> 00:33:38.767 align:middle line:10%
was the words he didn't use.

00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And I want to have
people actually

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
appreciate that he didn't say,
here's the business model.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You must have gone
through some [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.970 align:middle line:84%
being from Jamaica,
immigrating in the UK.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.215 align:middle line:84%
Being there and fully because
we know the inheritance,

00:33:56.215 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
you know, what you
just bring to come

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
here into this world with
all this luggage behind you.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is your advice in
regards to that because I think

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
this is a strong example of
overcoming and just being

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:84%
ourselves fully and owning
who we are in our magnificence

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that we can all relate to that
whatever that challenge is.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But I guess, I
mean, that was huge.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Was it there for you?

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Or you were actually brought in
this very nurturing, loving way

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that you always knew
exactly your place,

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:27.239 align:middle line:84%
or behind the back
of your mind it

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
was still there, that maybe you
didn't deserve to have this.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly as
a young boy I grew up.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:10%
And as young boy, I
loved my mother dearly.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
close to my mother,

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and what was
interesting is that I

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:84%
always thought that my
parents were immigrants.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.600 align:middle line:90%
But it was tough.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:10%
Back in those days, being
black in England was tough.

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:55.817 align:middle line:84%
And even in my business, when I
joined the financial industry,

00:34:55.817 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
I kind of new people
that people weren't doing

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.960 align:middle line:84%
business with me
for other reasons

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:90%
other than my business model.

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But that could be an
excuse, so my view is this.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Is that-- I'll give you some of
the feeling behind it because

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and I work as a
coach, as a writer.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm an author, and I speak.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.130 align:middle line:84%
At least, I was speaking
in Indonesia last week

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to some agents and wealth
managers from Jakarta and Bali,

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and I was blessed in
June to be able to speak

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:90%
to 7,000 people in Anaheim.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's great because
you get the opportunity

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to change lives and
give people another way

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.070 align:middle line:90%
of looking at things.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.250 align:middle line:84%
People have a philosophy of
goals and what they can do.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But I want to wake up the
philosophy inside of a person,

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to have them go internal and
go, OK, where's my genius?

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.630 align:middle line:90%
What's the philosophy for me?

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.872 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I speak to do.

00:35:52.872 --> 00:35:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I was perfectly on
time in that I feel.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Well it is at your own--
there are multiple numbers

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.460 align:middle line:84%
of philosophies for
happiness and success

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because there are multiple
people on this planet.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:08.740 align:middle line:84%
But I remember when
I was 13 years old,

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and I just ran home
from school one day.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of ran into the
door like it was half open,

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and as I looking
around the house,

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.610 align:middle line:84%
there are members of my family
and friends and people there.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what was going on.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And people weren't speaking,
and it was all quiet,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and it was just after school.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that,
in a few moments,

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:84%
my mother would be coming
because she gets home

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:90%
from work around that time.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So I looked out the window,
and I was waiting for the bus

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And her bus came and went, and
she didn't get off the bus.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm wondering were
she is and why she's late,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the neighbors burst
into the house and shouted,

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Mavis is dead.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Mavis is dead, and that was
my mom my mother's pet name.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Her real name is
Kathleen [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Mills, but at 13, that's how
I found out that she died.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell
you is that night--

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:84%
one thing I knew for sure
is I didn't believe it.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I was in denial.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I did not believe
that she was dead,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and I remember going to bed
that night and sitting by my bed

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and hugging the bed and
crying and praying that it was

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.920 align:middle line:90%
just a dream or some mistake.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:84%
When I work up in the
morning, it wasn't a dream.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It was real, and I
knew that she was dead.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But two weeks after the
funeral, I still haven't spoken,

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and I found that
I couldn't speak.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, it was time for
us all to go back to school.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of seven children, but
it's time to go back to school,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:90%
and we all went back to school.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And as fate would have
it, I sat in the classroom

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:90%
that first day.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those days where
the teacher has a reading book,

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has to take a
turn to read from the book,

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and it came to my
turn from the book.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked to the book and
I tried to read, all I could do

00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:02.830 align:middle line:84%
was there was, ka--
ka-- and I managed

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.962 align:middle line:84%
to blurt out that
I couldn't speak,

00:38:05.962 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and I just buried
my head in my hands.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember,
even now, was

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.000 align:middle line:84%
children laughing
around me, whispers

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.780 align:middle line:90%
and mummers going around me.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Me not wanting to be
there because what

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.145 align:middle line:84%
I'd realized that my
mother's death had done.

00:38:22.145 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:84%
It was such a trauma to
me that it had given me

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:30.074 align:middle line:84%
this amazingly bad
stutter or stammer,

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and it meant that
I couldn't speak.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:10%
When I spoke, it was awful.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, I
spoke with a huge embarrassing

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.260 align:middle line:90%
stammer and stutter.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't get my words
out, couldn't articulate.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.540 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to believe.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, that stayed with me
right through my teenage years.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know how cruel children
can be when you have a stutter.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, even in college
I had a nickname,

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was nicknamed
the stuttering parrot.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:84%
That was my friends,
so it was a--

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Your friends [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, and actually it
wasn't until my mid-twenties

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.046 align:middle line:84%
when things changed because,
and again, I realize now

00:39:09.046 --> 00:39:10.410 align:middle line:90%
it was one of those moments.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't call it a
10-second moment them.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.240 align:middle line:84%
A moment I was in
the office one day,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.935 align:middle line:84%
and again, the universe
collaborating ways we

00:39:18.935 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:90%
can't always understand.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.902 align:middle line:84%
And the meaning isn't
always obvious in that time.

00:39:22.902 --> 00:39:24.735 align:middle line:84%
Because many times, we have
things happen in our lives,

00:39:24.735 --> 00:39:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and we say, well, that means
that, and that means that.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, it may not mean that.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:84%
The meaning could
be 20 years later,

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.495 align:middle line:84%
or the meaning could
not be for you at all.

00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.095 align:middle line:84%
It could be for another
soul, for another spirit

00:39:33.095 --> 00:39:34.500 align:middle line:90%
for somebody else.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So one day I'm in the office,
and the owner of the business

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:84%
asked me to introduced him to a
bunch of new potential recruits

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.070 align:middle line:90%
in the office.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.052 align:middle line:84%
And I said actually, you know,
obviously I can't do this.

00:39:46.052 --> 00:39:47.677 align:middle line:90%
You know I can't do this I said.

00:39:47.677 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
there's no one around.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is out seeing
clients and just prospecting.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're the only
one in the office.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.160 align:middle line:90%
You need to do this.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So I went into this room
with only about 16 people,

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're all potential
recruits for the company.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I actually don't
know what I said.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Even now I don't
know what I said.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
What I do know is
that I stammered.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I stuttered.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I sweated, spluttered,
and eventually I

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:84%
looked for the door, and I said,
Dennis, through the glass door.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And he took my note,
and he came in the room.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And I had to sit there for the
whole hour and a half or so

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:84%
with humiliation knowing
that everyone in the room

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:90%
know how badly I performed.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.252 align:middle line:84%
So but that wasn't
the end of it.

00:40:27.252 --> 00:40:28.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was over.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You know how you've
been to those places

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:84%
where you're hoping that
there will be an emergency.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:84%
You're hoping the
phone will ring

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.657 align:middle line:84%
and someone will get
you out of the room,

00:40:34.657 --> 00:40:35.490 align:middle line:90%
but there's no emergency.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.624 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay in the room for
the whole of this presentation.

00:40:37.624 --> 00:40:38.323 align:middle line:90%
That is the thing.

00:40:38.323 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
We always think we're
going to be saved.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, great.
Really good.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
I'm in the office.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm only a junior at the time.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the office,
and I get a letter

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:90%
addressed to me personally.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And the letter was
from a young lady

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:84%
who had been in that small
group of potential recruits.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And she explained to me.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:84%
She said that she didn't
get a job or a position

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.180 align:middle line:90%
as a trainee with the company.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And she mentioned she had this
experience and that experience

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and that qualification
and she finished

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.490 align:middle line:84%
off the letter by
saying, I didn't

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:90%
get the job Mr. [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I can't understand how I didn't
get the job when someone like

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.680 align:middle line:84%
you who can't even
speak properly

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and who babbled incoherently
can be in the company,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And that was her letter.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I know is
that in that moment

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.765 align:middle line:84%
in the open planned
office because that

00:41:22.765 --> 00:41:24.450 align:middle line:90%
was two weeks later.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.535 align:middle line:84%
Bizarre, as it may sound, I kind
of new in that moment, everyone

00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:29.330 align:middle line:90%
could read my mind.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.570 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE] I can't read this
letter again because if I do,

00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.180 align:middle line:10%
they'll all pick up
on my humiliation.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So I screwed the letter up,
and I threw it in a basked

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.980 align:middle line:90%
beneath my desk.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, regardless
of her intention for writing

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.170 align:middle line:90%
that letter, she was right.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.900 align:middle line:10%
I knew that I couldn't
speak properly,

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:10%
so I made a commitment that
day to learn to speak again

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:10%
for a second time,
to learn to speak

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.210 align:middle line:10%
properly for a second time.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:54.950 align:middle line:10%
So I did that.

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.190 align:middle line:10%
Went on speaking courses.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.260 align:middle line:10%
Went on Dale Carnegie
course over 14 weeks.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And starting off, let's just say
stuttering, stuttering starts,

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.940 align:middle line:10%
and by end of that
14-week program,

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.025 align:middle line:10%
I had emerged as the person
with the most improvement.

00:42:11.025 --> 00:42:12.140 align:middle line:10%
I didn't become a speaker.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:10%
That was when I was 25.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:10%
I didn't become a speaker
until two years ago,

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.790 align:middle line:10%
as in professional speaker
because when I changed my life

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.310 align:middle line:10%
around, so many people
kept turning up and saying,

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.180 align:middle line:10%
what do you do?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Share with us?

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.659 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me about standards.
I've had goals.

00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm still not happy.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I had
a second awakening.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.650 align:middle line:84%
So that question
by a security guard

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.216 align:middle line:84%
was really just the first
awa-- I woke up and found who

00:42:36.216 --> 00:42:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I really was that took
me out of my unhappiness

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in a financial position.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The second awakening came
in 2010 where I realized

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:90%
this isn't just for me.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:84%
These people have been turning
up over the last few years.

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not just me.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It's me to share what came out
to my true self with the world,

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:84%
so I am, at that point,
in the June, 2010, went

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.980 align:middle line:84%
along to a small chapter of
the professional speaking

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:03.985 align:middle line:90%
association.

00:43:03.985 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a 10-minute
showcase to share

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:84%
my philosophy of
standards and set of goals

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:90%
and share my story.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:15.010 align:middle line:10%
And they gave me such
an amazing welcome,

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:19.820 align:middle line:10%
and it was humbling, the
response that they gave me.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt,
yeah, I'm doing this.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:26.125 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the kind of
person where kind of I

00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.830 align:middle line:84%
still wanted to
test it some more.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying I had
a massive external frame

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.530 align:middle line:84%
of reference, but I did want
to test and see whether, are

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:90%
they just being kind.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.130 align:middle line:90%
They're lovely people.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Are they just being nice?

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I then applied to
speak at the global speaker

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.770 align:middle line:90%
summit, which was last April.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, actually,
no, you can't

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:45.935 align:middle line:84%
speak at that because it's
being booked for a year ahead.

00:43:45.935 --> 00:43:47.275 align:middle line:90%
Also, because it's booked.

00:43:47.275 --> 00:43:50.250 align:middle line:84%
But something inside me
just said, check again.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So I checked again last
January, no response.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Checked again last February with
an email, and I emailed saying,

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:90%
could I speak.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Has anybody dropped out.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
An email came back
within minutes saying,

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:90%
someone just dropped out.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.980 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
to speak about.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, I ended up
speaking at the global speaker

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:84%
summit last April
in front of a room

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:12.380 align:middle line:84%
full of international
speakers and coaches whatever,

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and they gave me
such an innovation

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:84%
at the end that I knew
I had got something

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
different message,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:90%
a different philosophy.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:10%
And the universe was really
collaborating because

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.475 align:middle line:10%
in the same room there
with someone who knew

00:44:27.475 --> 00:44:31.780 align:middle line:10%
a film producer in Las Vegas.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And they introduce me
to this film producer

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the following week
who then asked

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:84%
me to do after the the
conversation on the phone,

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.210 align:middle line:84%
said she loved my ideas, loved
the philosophy of standards

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.360 align:middle line:84%
instead of goals, the story
and all the rest of it

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and what I was
doing in the world.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So what she asked me to do was
to have a cameo in her film.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.514 align:middle line:84%
And film is called "The
Keeper of the Keys."

00:44:53.514 --> 00:44:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting about
"The Keeper of the Keys"

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.676 align:middle line:84%
is that it starts Jack Canfield,
Dr. John Gray-- he did "Men are

00:44:58.676 --> 00:45:00.680 align:middle line:84%
from Mars, Women are from
Venus" and Marcy [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.580 align:middle line:90%
"I'm Happy for No Reason."

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And said to me, they would
love you in that film.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So I got a three minute
cameo, and by the way,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:84%
my global speaker summit
talk was my fifth talk.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:14.830 align:middle line:10%
And so on my fifth
talk ever in public

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:16.810 align:middle line:10%
around my philosophy
in life, I'd been

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:10%
asked to star in this film.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:84%
The film came out this
year produced by Robin Jay.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I've got a copy
for you of the DVD.

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is when
we follow our true self path,

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.110 align:middle line:84%
then things happen for us which
you might in another arena

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:38.020 align:middle line:84%
called serendipity
or coincidence.

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But my life since my openness
of my true self, the most

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
incredible things and
people have happened to me

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to such a regular degree that
I forgot-- I said to myself,

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.400 align:middle line:90%
this isn't serendipity.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.160 align:middle line:90%
This is not coincidence.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:90%
This is nothing of the sort.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.850 align:middle line:90%
This is how life should be.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So the question becomes what are
we doing not to be in the place

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.620 align:middle line:90%
where life is like this for us.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're really saying, well,
what I realized was actually

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:84%
meeting the right people,
being asked to do these things,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.690 align:middle line:84%
being contacted by a
bureau in Europe that

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.570 align:middle line:84%
represents Tony Robbins and
then being on the same agency

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:90%
as him.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.970 align:middle line:84%
That came out of
the same meeting,

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and those are the things which
we haven't got time for today.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And also [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, yeah, it
didn't come up to that

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:20.890 align:middle line:90%
because there's lots probably.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a limited time, but the
thing I'm trying to share today

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the silly
genius that I put

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.470 align:middle line:84%
on the book, a practical guide
to releasing your inner genius.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:90%
We've all got that inner genius.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I know we have.

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We've all got it, and
it's about my inner genius

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:84%
helping other people to get
there's out into the world.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of their
background, and what

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:43.830 align:middle line:90%
we thought of ourselves.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that was
relevant, I mean,

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:84%
there are some
areas that I don't

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
know as in why
one spirit is born

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.300 align:middle line:90%
in poverty in Asia or Africa.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Another is born
into royal family

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:84%
or another is born as
you, another born as me,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's around,
we can all have excuses.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I could say,
well, I'm black.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Growing up in
England, hard time,

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to do business in England
and to be a financial services

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:14.310 align:middle line:84%
agent and financial planner
when you're market is all white

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're black, difficult.
That could be an excuse.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm from a poor
background, very poor.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:90%
My father worked in a factory.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.070 align:middle line:84%
When my mother
died, seven of us.

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:90%
He looked after us.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:26.975 align:middle line:90%
I could that as an excuse.

00:47:26.975 --> 00:47:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have a silver
spoon in my mouth.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Does that translate, yeah?

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Didn't have a silver spoon.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Lots of reasons.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I had a stutter.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I could have been somewhere
completely different.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, they don't
count for anything if you get

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.384 align:middle line:84%
through a life of either 20
years or 30 years of 97 years

00:47:45.384 --> 00:47:48.180 align:middle line:84%
or 102 years if you don't
get what's inside of you

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.360 align:middle line:90%
outside of you.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.970 align:middle line:90%
The excuses count for naught.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:51.750 align:middle line:90%
It's about who you are.

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So being Jamaican
and stuttering,

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.860 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE] mother.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.280 align:middle line:84%
That could be a reason
not to find myself.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.510 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted the reasons not to
find yourself, there are a few.

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it became, OK, and
having that quiet desperation

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.575 align:middle line:84%
of financial, well,
almost been broke

00:48:07.575 --> 00:48:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and being almost depressed.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And knowing I'm
ruining my relationship

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.620 align:middle line:90%
my closest loved ones.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:90%
That can all be excuses.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is, they
don't count for anything.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.040 align:middle line:90%
What counts is who are you?

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:84%
What's really inside
of you, and what

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:23.395 align:middle line:84%
are you doing to get what's
inside of you, outside of you.

00:48:23.395 --> 00:48:24.955 align:middle line:84%
If you really want
to be happy, it's

00:48:24.955 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:90%
about finding your true self.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And what comes out that
as in we all will find

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
is what comes out of that is
joy and happiness and light.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the more we share our
light, the more people

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:90%
the people can light up.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:10%
Because one thing I was
[INAUDIBLE] last week when

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.120 align:middle line:10%
I was in Bali, and I
talked about my problems

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.850 align:middle line:10%
that I had, black and
mother dying and stutter.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And I said, and the phrase
that she used then was it

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.980 align:middle line:10%
must have been
really, really dark.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.240 align:middle line:10%
And yes, at times it was
really, really, really dark

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.250 align:middle line:10%
and not a lot nice
life to be living in.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:84%
But then I got to thinking after
having the meeting with her,

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was out of
respect for her company.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
even in the darkest

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.010 align:middle line:84%
darkness, if you
turn on the light,

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.645 align:middle line:84%
everyone turns
towards the light.

00:49:15.645 --> 00:49:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Even the smallest
light when it's dark,

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.330 align:middle line:84%
everyone turns
towards the light.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:23.845 align:middle line:84%
So we have almost
a responsibility

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to let our lights
out in the world.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is inside of
us to get the light out.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Get the light out.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Share your light,
small or large.

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Find out what light
you've got inside of you

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and share it with the world.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And others who are
in darkness, they'll

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:84%
be able to see it their way and
see what's, and the other thing

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.950 align:middle line:84%
that comes out of that is
that if you have a light,

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.310 align:middle line:84%
people around you
will allow themselves

00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to put their lights on because
they can see with your light.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you shine, it's as if
you shine and gives permission

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:90%
to them to also shine.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's more than just for me.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just for
you or us as individuals.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:03.070 align:middle line:84%
It's around looking around
the world and saying,

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.890 align:middle line:90%
it is rule one, all oneness.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And for all oneness, and we're
seeing someone in darkness.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.160 align:middle line:10%
One of the best way of getting
someone else out of darkness

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.150 align:middle line:10%
is to put on our own light.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.440 align:middle line:10%
Turn our own light on,
and then as we go around,

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:16.550 align:middle line:10%
share the light.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:19.800 align:middle line:10%
And then who knows where
their light ends up.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.510 align:middle line:10%
You know, what was
interesting for me

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.560 align:middle line:10%
as a realization a few years
ago is if I have a candle,

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:10%
and if I take a candle
here and I light it,

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.275 align:middle line:10%
and I've got some light.

00:50:30.275 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:10%
But if you have a candle,
and yours isn't lit,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.570 align:middle line:10%
I can pass some light to you.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't diminish
me whatsoever.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.010 align:middle line:84%
My light stays the same,
but you now have your light,

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and we both have two
lights in the room.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.660 align:middle line:10%
And if the room is
full of other people,

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.660 align:middle line:10%
then we can all share
light with each other.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And we all benefit from
all the light in the room,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.270 align:middle line:10%
so sharing the light, even
from the most basic level,

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:54.800 align:middle line:10%
benefits us as well as the room.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.730 align:middle line:10%
And every person we share the
light with because my light

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.080 align:middle line:10%
still shines, and I
can give you light.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.192 align:middle line:10%
So for me, part of
that realization,

00:51:01.192 --> 00:51:03.240 align:middle line:10%
and if by discovery
of true self,

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.130 align:middle line:10%
is to say what light have I got?

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.360 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what light is
going to shed for the people,

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.300 align:middle line:10%
but get it out there,
and share the light.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.360 align:middle line:10%
And who knows one
day what you put out

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.880 align:middle line:10%
comes back to you when
you're in a dark place.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.730 align:middle line:10%
But even if that
didn't happen, you've

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.590 align:middle line:10%
put light out into
the world, and that's

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.650 align:middle line:10%
what I think is part of
what we're all-- what I

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:25.070 align:middle line:10%
believe that we're here to do.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, well thank
you so much, Derek,

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
for this really
delicious moment.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited to get
this out and to be

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.090 align:middle line:90%
able to share your wisdom.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And more than your
wisdom, your spirit

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.700 align:middle line:84%
really because your spirit
comes out, and it's such a gift.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.414 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed this.

00:51:43.414 --> 00:51:44.380 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I want to thank you.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And also because I'm here,
I wanted to thank you,

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:52.400 align:middle line:10%
and also I've got a chance
now to get the philosophy out

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.090 align:middle line:10%
because of one introduction
to [INAUDIBLE],

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:57.535 align:middle line:10%
and [INAUDIBLE] have
been supporting me

00:51:57.535 --> 00:51:59.570 align:middle line:10%
all the way through saying
you've got something to share

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:10%
here and has supported me
by having the book published

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.220 align:middle line:10%
all over the world, in
America, UK, US, India, Africa,

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Australia, and New Zealand.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:12.220 align:middle line:10%
And the way I see that is
as a light going out there,

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:10%
and I want to thank [INAUDIBLE]
for a first-time author.

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.440 align:middle line:90%
And for them to see some

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Another baby.

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, exactly.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:21.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and they've nurtured me.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.830 align:middle line:10%
That's well put.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.521 align:middle line:10%
They've nurtured me in
helping [INAUDIBLE] you've

00:52:24.521 --> 00:52:25.220 align:middle line:10%
got something.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.960 align:middle line:10%
And, god willing, I'll get the
opportunities to write more

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.610 align:middle line:10%
and to share more through
speaking and through mentoring

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:33.020 align:middle line:10%
and through programs
and writing and get

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.300 align:middle line:10%
more light out into the world.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.810 align:middle line:10%
Because if I can just get light
into another person's life

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.770 align:middle line:10%
which gives them light
to see their way,

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.630 align:middle line:10%
and they can pass the
light on, my job's done.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.790 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we want to get
more of you, and I'm

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.540 align:middle line:84%
sure we'll hear a lot more
of you, so thank you so much.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Much, much love my
delicious co-creators

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.460 align:middle line:90%
wherever you are in the world.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.267 align:middle line:90%
Big kiss, bye.
