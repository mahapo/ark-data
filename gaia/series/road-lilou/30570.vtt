00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my delicious
co-creators.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Glasgow today
in Scotland with David.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Hello David.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.391 align:middle line:84%
Hello, Lilou, and
how are you today?

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:10%
Very good.
I love your accent.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Scottish
through and through.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in this area.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:90%
I studied in Glasgow.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I went to university
here, my degree and PhD,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
both about-- in fact
about three minutes

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.401 align:middle line:84%
walk from where we're
sitting right now.

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of a dream
come true for you, unexpected,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
your life went in an
unexpected way, not

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
really the way that you who had
studied, but this is quite big.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow you are speaking
in the big auditorium

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
here on the river?
-Yeah.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking at the Scottish
Exhibition Conference Center.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's the biggest self-help
conference ever in Scotland.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's all Hay House authors,
So it's Hay House, I can do it.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so excited.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I visualized
this about 10 years ago.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
12 years ago actually, I did
my very first public event.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I had resigned from-- I
used to be a scientist

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
in the pharmaceutical industry.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I had resigned and did my
very, very first event.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was only
13 people at it.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:90%
I was all filled with big ideas.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I'm leaving my job.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking for lots
and lots of people.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:90%
And there's was 13.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Nine of them were
family and friends.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.491 align:middle line:84%
And three of them came because
I met them in a cafe the week

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.901 align:middle line:84%
And they only came if
they didn't have to pay.

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So only one--
-It was free.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So only one person
really paid, really came.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, I
thought, I'm not

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
very good at this organizing
pf the event situation

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's cost
me a lot of money.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling
a bit dejected.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, the
workshop went really well.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.602 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I
was saying, damn it,

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make this work.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
I immediately visualized
myself speaking

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
alongside Wayne Dyer and
Louise Hay and a few others.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And I decided it was going
to be at the Scottish

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Exhibition Conference
or the Clyde Auditorium

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.215 align:middle line:90%
as it's known as.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:05.915 align:middle line:90%
And I decided.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:07.046 align:middle line:90%
I didn't set a time on it.

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
I just said, that's
what I was going to do.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
And this image
popped into my mind

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Wayne Dyer
speaking and finishing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and I came on right after Wayne
and I got a big high five.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because tomorrow,
I'm right after Wayne Dyer.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'll see if the
high five happens.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
At least I visualized
it 12 years ago.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a big achievement
to have-- well,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to me the most amazing
thing about your whole story

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is that you were working for
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
You were well paid.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
You had everything.
It's all set.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But one day you decided to
resign because it no longer fit

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:90%
with your perception of things.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
No, yeah, I did
my PhD in a field

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
called organic chemistry, which
basically you build molecules.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:90%
You stick atoms together.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the pharmaceutical
industry where I ended up

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
after my PhD, I was building
and developing drugs

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
for heart disease and cancer.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But I started to notice,
when we tested the drugs,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.425 align:middle line:84%
you give 100 people a drug
and 100 people the fake drug,

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
a placebo, which
is made of sugar,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
blackboard chalk,
these type of things.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in it really.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But incredibly, loads and
loads of people get better.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes almost as many
on the placebo as people

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:90%
actually on the drug.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, what
on earth is going on here?

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
So in my spare time I started
to research what happens

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:90%
when you have a thought?

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I think we grow up,
certainly in the West,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.784 align:middle line:84%
we grow up with this idea
that you have a thought

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and it just disappears.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a floaty thing that
has no power whatsoever.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no
that's not correct.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a
thought, you start to change

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:90%
the chemistry of your brain.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you think the same
thought over and over again,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
you begin to shape the
actual physical structure

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And the placebo effect
works in the sense

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that when you believe something
or expect a drug to work,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a placebo,
you change brain chemistry

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and you also impact on some
of the physiological processes

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
this is incredible.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.095 align:middle line:90%
People must know about this.

00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So even though I was
in a well paid job,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I completely lost
interest in making

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
drugs, no interest at all.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.877 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't-- it
was so interesting for me,

00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't let it go.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:90%
So I just decided to resign.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I resigned to start writing
books and giving public talks.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
You self-published
your first book.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to self-publish.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I contacted every main
publisher in the UK

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't really
go for it at the time.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I'm determined

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
to write a book so I'm
just going to do it anyway.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And this was back in 2005.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:90%
So I just self-published.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
But then Hay House picked it
up really quickly after that.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And my other six books are
with Hey House as well.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And your latest one came
out in October, 2012.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Is Your
Life Mapped Out?"

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And the subtitle is
"Unraveling the Mystery

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:90%
of Destiny versus Free Will."

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
also speak about that.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But first I would love
to see how you started.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:90%
So you quit that job.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
You starting writing this book
and what kind of evidence--

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.100 align:middle line:84%
because you really bridge
science with spirituality.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
How did you-- what
had happened there?

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
What kind of research
have you done and papers

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
you put together
or facts that are

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
really mind boggling that
you can present to us today?

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
I started researching

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
was placebo effect and studying
what happens in the brain

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:90%
chemically.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And how does a placebo
effect occur inside the body?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And that naturally led me
into all the different ways

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:90%
that mind impacted the body.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up
researching meditation.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't publish
any of my own research

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
because there's
so much out there.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.476 align:middle line:84%
So I find myself taking
the complex stuff

00:05:47.476 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that's out there that most
people don't understand.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you take a scientific
paper, publication,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:90%
it's full of jargon.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Even just looking at the
abstract, the summary,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:90%
it's still full of jargon.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So I started to take--
most of my books

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:90%
have 200 to 300 references.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I compile all that
and compact it down.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And my thing, if
you care to call it,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:90%
my thing is explaining stuff.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I take the
complex stuff and I package it

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.931 align:middle line:84%
in a simple way that my mom
and dad and my Auntie Jean

00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
can read.
-And my kid.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and kids can read
and understand and think,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that's really easy.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So when I first
started doing this,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
it was placebo effect,
then meditation.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much stuff
on how meditation can impact

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the heart and how meditation
could structurally

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:90%
impact to the brain.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you listen to the
sound of your breathing

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and you impact
several brain regions.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you practice
over and over again,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
you actually shape the
physical structure of the brain

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and the top of the brain
here, the prefrontal cortex.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
You actually physically
shape the structure.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Neuroplasticity?

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Neuroplasticity, yeah, yeah.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And even visualizing
itself, not just meditating

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:84%
on the sound of your breath, but
visualizing something happening

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
in your life, you
also physically shape

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:90%
the structure of the brain.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And through neuroplasticity,
the brain can even be

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:90%
thought of as akin to a muscle.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
If you exercise a muscle, it
gets stronger and develops.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you visualize something
or imagine the same thing

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
over and over again,
the brain also

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:90%
begins to change like a muscle.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, some
of the things I realized

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
is the brain can't distinguish
between whether something's

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
actually happening or whether
you're just imagining it.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're imagining
healing or changing your life,

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
then in many ways, once
you've done it's a memory.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
It's already happened
for your brain.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And the skill then is
to get out of the way.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
getting out of the way,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
stop believing that
you can't for example.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a big one.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a big, big one.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
this conversation,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:84%
because it shows us that
really anything is possible.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder why this
information is not out anymore.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Were you stopped at
any time of the way

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
by other pharmaceutical
business?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean how did they react
so when you stopped?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Well for me, I found it
relatively easy because what

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I do is I back up
everything I say

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and everything I write
about with solid science.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really try
to make any enemies.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not out there telling
people, you can use your mind.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:84%
If a person's got cancer,
I'm not saying use your mind

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.250 align:middle line:90%
and forget medical advice.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I say do both.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Take medical advice but
use your mind as well.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Not instead of, but as well as.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we wouldn't
use the mind at all.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:84%
So by going through
this mechanism,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I guess, and I'm asking people
to live their life in the way

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:90%
they would normally live it.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Take the advice they
can ordinarily take,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
but here is the power of
the mind as well as that,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and then we start to develop
this feeling inside ourselves,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
this faith in
ourselves that we have

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
far more than we think we are.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And who knows where that
will actually lead to

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our capabilities.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think at the moment,
what I've purposely

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
tried to do is straddle, make
a bridge into the mainstream

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.934 align:middle line:84%
because I think
most people who have

00:09:05.934 --> 00:09:07.200 align:middle line:84%
this interest in the
power of the mind

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, it's
a group of people.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a certain
market, if you like,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:90%
in terms of book publishing.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an area
people are interested.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And all these other
people in the world

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
could really benefit
from this knowledge,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.030 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know about it.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I find is happening
as I'm bridging this gap

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
with science, is many people
in the mainstream are thinking,

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
whoa, I totally did not
know that, and finding they

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
can really use that
in their lives.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's the most fascinating
thing I'm finding really.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't set out to do that.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I just noticed that the
bridge has been forming now.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I've not really had
pharmaceutical companies

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
tell me, you can't say
this and all that thing.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
saying they're wrong.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying you
can do this as well.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:84%
But you're clearly
pioneering, to step

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
out of this kind of work and
to say bye, bye to some money.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.401 align:middle line:84%
It's a challenge that a
lot of people are facing.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I was the
first scientist

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
in the pharmaceutical
industry in the UK

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
ever to leave to talk
about the placebo effect

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:90%
and the power of the mind.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, I feel
like a walking a path.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:90%
But I love it.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Because it's my passion.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of
anything else I'd

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
rather do in my life is talk
about the power of the mind.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
talk about a lot as well

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
is if we cultivate a sense
of compassion and kindness

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
in our hearts and
minds, we also shape

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:90%
the chemistry of the body.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Thinking compassion,
thinking kindness

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
actually dilates the arteries
and lowers blood pressure.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about this
kind of stuff a lot

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and how kindness and compassion
is actually physically

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to your heart.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Where I grew up in the
village I grew up in,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the women used to say, if
you live from the heart,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:90%
it's good for the heart.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny because now
we have the medical evidence

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:84%
that if you live from the
heart, and I'm talking you know,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:84%
physically being kind and
compassionate, but also

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in your head, just thinking
about people that you love

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about
kindness and compassion,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
because of the mind
body connection

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.485 align:middle line:84%
you start to have this
cardio-protective-- it's

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
a word, protects your
cardiovascular system,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
cardioprotective effect
that few people realize

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
but it applies to everyone.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I mean
by forming this bridge.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Because most people in
the mind spirit world

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
know this stuff or it
make sense to them.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But all these people out
here in the mainstream

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
could really benefit
from this stuff.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.040 align:middle line:84%
But they've just never heard it
because to them, all this stuff

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:90%
over here is woo-woo.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So when I bridge the
gap with the science,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
it like whoa, that's
really interesting.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So I find a lot
of my stuff is now

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
getting written up in
mainstream newspapers in the UK.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewed with a
big mainstream newspaper

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
just other day there and all the
mainstream magazines in the UK

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:84%
are featured articles
now on this stuff,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
which was 10 years ago, no
chance, absolutely no chance.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And it is happening.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I really see it as I'm
traveling throughout Europe

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and as we're having
all those conversations

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:90%
that things are evolving.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And we need to more
of these evidence.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So how do you explain
it scientifically?

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
What do you suggest
to people or is

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
there are some things that you
want to tell us about the brain

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
or about in the emanation of the
heart or some things that show?

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:90%
Because we know it.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:90%
A lot of us know it intuitively.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know
how to explain it.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we find ourselves
a bit short in conversations,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
like but I just know.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not scientific, but I know.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for doing the
work that you're doing.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Because you're giving
us clues and information

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:90%
that are useful.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:84%
What I often do is just
quote a piece of research.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I'm
suggesting to people that what

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
they visualize can have a
physical impact in the body,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
now to the mainstream, that
would sound preposterous.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
How can I visualize
myself and change my body?

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's one part of
many parts of evidence.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Harvard University did
this fantastic study

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
where they asked volunteers
to play a simple combination

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:06.990 align:middle line:90%
of piano notes.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So they literally sat
in front of a piano

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and went plunk, plunk,
plunk, plunk repetitively

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
for two hours, just five
finger muscle combination,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
repetitively for two hours
on five consecutive days,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:90%
so Monday through Friday.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
brain imaged every day.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.256 align:middle line:84%
And what the scientists
found is that the area

00:13:26.256 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of the brain connected
to their finger muscles

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:90%
began to grow like a muscle.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And by the fifth day, it
was substantially larger

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:90%
than it was on the Monday.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the term
known as neuroplasticity.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But where it gets really
interesting is a separate group

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
of volunteers, instead
of physical playing

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
the piano notes, plunk,
plunk, plunk, plunk,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:90%
they had to do in their heads.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
So they had to just with,
without moving their muscles,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
they had to imagine going plunk,
plunk, plunk, plunk, plunk,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:84%
plunk, repetitively,
for the same two hours

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
for the same five consecutive
days, Monday through Friday.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And they had their
brain imaged every day.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And incredibly,
their brain began

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
to grow like a muscle
in the area connected

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.420 align:middle line:90%
to the finger muscles.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you compared on the
Friday, the brain images

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:84%
for those who physically
played the notes with those who

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
imagined playing the notes, put
the slides beside each other,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't tell
the difference.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the brain was not

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:84%
distinguishing between
who actually played piano

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:90%
and who was imagining it.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very, very
powerful piece of evidence

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that shows that
we have physically

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
shaped the structure of the
brain by imagining something.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do that,
what else can we do?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
If we can physically
change-- I mean,

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to change brain
structure, you're

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
talking the creation
of hundreds of billions

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:40.970 align:middle line:90%
of neural connections.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And a neural connection is
like, if you take two trees

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and hold the roots together,
opposite each other

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and imagine the roots were
growing towards each other,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
hundreds of billions

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of brand new roots being created
seemingly out of thin air,

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
but not really.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a little domino
effect from the impact

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:90%
of your imagining on your genes.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.190 align:middle line:84%
At the genetic level, there's a
whole domino effect that starts

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:90%
to construct these connections.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But this is occurring because
of something you're imagining,

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
not something you're doing.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I present that
kind of evidence to people

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's published in a top
level mainstream journal,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to then have any
argument against that the mind

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:90%
has this effect on.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:90%
The body

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
What part of the
brain actually?

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
How can you see that's it's
growing, it's connecting?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
There are several brain
imaging techniques.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
In this piano study,
they used a technique

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
called transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
heard of MRI and PET.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
TMS, transcranial
magnetic stimulation,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
is just a way of imaging
the brain by fighting bolts

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic pulses
into it and you can get

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:90%
a picture of what's going on.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And what they find is the area
of the brain begins to grow,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's the area connected
to the finger muscles

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because you're imagining
your finger muscles growing.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Which area of the brain?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
It's right across here.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:90%
It's called the motor cortex.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It runs right across the
top of the head here.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:08.615 align:middle line:84%
And actually it's shaped --
it's called the homunculus.

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
A homunculus is like a
reflexology maps, right?

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You look at a reflexology
map of the foot

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and you see there's
a bit for the liver,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:90%
the kidneys, and all that.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the brain it's
referred to as a homunculus.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the whole body part
is compressed into the strip.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a different
part for your little finger.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
part for you big toe.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a part for your ear,
your nose, your buttock.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Up So when you
place your attention

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
on any part of
the body, in fact,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:84%
this was done at the
Karolinska Institute

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:84%
in Sweden, which is one of
the most famous institutes

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in the world because
Nobel Prize winners give

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Nobel lectures there in
medicine and physiology.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And they found that if you
just put your attention

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.290 align:middle line:84%
on your tongue or on your finger
or another part of your body,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:84%
you activate selectively the
part of the reflexology map

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.990 align:middle line:84%
or homunculus as it's
known in the brain,

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
you specifically activate that
part and not the other parts,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
just where your
attention is focused.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the mind body
spirit field for years,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
people have said energy
flows where attention goes.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a real
neurological sense,

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we now have the evidence that
if you place your attention,

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
there is certainly activation
in the brain and a current

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of electricity that
stimulates the specific area,

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
even if it's the
tip of your finger.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So when the people
did the piano study

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they found that the
specific finger muscles,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:84%
those specific parts of the
brain and everywhere else,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
just those parts began
to grow like a muscle.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I love hearing those.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So one of the questions that
now runs through my mind

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of
scientific00 or we

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:84%
hear a lot to talk about
our left and right brain.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually helping
also to bridge both sides

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
because we're learning more
and more that it's important

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%
that those are more balanced.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't the case before.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
We used to only function mainly
through the analytical mind,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
but we're hearing more
and more that it's

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
important to incorporate
the emotional side as well.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the more we allow
ourselves to feel our emotions

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and express our
emotions-- I'm sitting

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:90%
here in a hotel in Scotland.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I grew up in
Scotland, showing your emotions

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:90%
was not a big thing.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So I personally grew up-- I
worked as a scientist for years

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
in the lab and I
still had difficulty

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
showing emotion because it's
embarrassing, for men like me.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It's embarrassing
according to our culture

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:90%
so I would never do it.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And it has taken me a
decade since leaving

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:90%
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And now I've gotten so
far to the other side,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that I watch anything that's
slightly emotional on TV

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:90%
and I'm weeping all over.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
My partner looks right at
me and goes, tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I could be watching--
there's an Australian soap

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
called "Neighbors" that
I watch every other day.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I cry at
"Neighbors," even things

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.130 align:middle line:90%
that nobody else is crying at.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a consequence
of me using my creative side.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Because in the lab it
was just analytical, just

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:90%
left brain the whole time.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I left there and
started to research other stuff

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and visualize stuff,
the more you visualize,

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.410 align:middle line:84%
you start to use
the right brain.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's begun
to happen is it's

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to express and feel
emotion in a much deeper way

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:90%
than ever before.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But what it also
does is, because I'm

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
using the left and the right,
analytical and the imaginative,

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
the creativity part
of it, it integrates

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
both hemispheres together.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with far more
brain capacity, brainpower,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.760 align:middle line:84%
much clearer, sharper in your
mind than ever I was before.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
really bright, really

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:90%
clever when I was a scientist.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.544 align:middle line:84%
But I'm light years beyond
where I was a decade ago.

00:19:41.544 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
A lot of scientific are right
now stuck in their equations

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and in papers that are there.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And from a lot of interviews
that I'm doing a lot of people

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
speak about stepping
in the unknown

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and there is some scientists
that have stepped in there.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's called quantum
physics, I guess, small more

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
in that field, where
you just go into a much

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
larger scope of life.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And it seems like this
is where it's heading.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you speak of
quantum entanglement

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of things now.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's backed up
by this new science.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
This is so fascinating.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:84%
See if you were to look
inside any part of your body.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So I could look inside
my hand, and if you

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
look inside your
hand, you get cells.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But look inside my
cells, you find your DNA,

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:90%
proteins, enzymes, hormones.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And you look inside
them, and you

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
find they're made of atoms,
carbons, hydrogens, oxygen,

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:90%
nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
You look inside an atom
and there's nothing there.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Almost nothing.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
You have protons, neutrons, and
electrons croutons and morons.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.285 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:20:46.285 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
No, you don't really
have croutons and morons.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But there should be croutons,
because the Large Hadron

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Collider in Switzerland has
been smashing particles together

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
and all the fragments
that come out of it

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:90%
are known as a quantum soup.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So I think there should be
croutons, just not name it yet.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, protons,
neutrons, and electrons.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing, is
inside an atom there is

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
99.9999999999999% empty space.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
That's 13 nines percent
empty space inside an atom.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
If a proton was the
size of a grape,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
like a grape that
you make wine out of,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
if a proton was the
size of a grape,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:84%
the closest electron would be
the size of a particle of dust.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
approximately two miles away.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So think for the moment how
far two miles is from her.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And imagine I have a grape in
my hand and that's a proton.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The closest electron
is two miles away

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's now buzzing around.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a reality inside
every atom in the body.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are
countless, trillions,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
trillions and trillions
and godzillions

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.650 align:middle line:90%
of atoms inside the body.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.475 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
interest phenomena

00:21:54.475 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that you begin to observe when
you get to the quantum level.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you look
inside a proton

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's three quarks, two
up quarks and a down quark.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
this kind of level,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:84%
you find that all of the
particles are interconnected.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And scientist call
that entanglement.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And most cosmologists
would now agree

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that the birth of the
universe, every particle

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
was connected at one point.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore on some
level, the entire universe

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:90%
is now entangled.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is that
the particles, the protons

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
inside your body right now are
connected to protons in a leaf

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
on a tree in the
Amazon rainforest,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
which are connected to electrons
in the outermost portions

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
of a distant galaxy
a trillion trillion

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:90%
billion light years from here.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:90%
And everything's interconnected.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
What's really interesting
is on some level,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:84%
you have types of
particles called fermions

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and no two fermions
can be the same state.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So on one level,
as you just think,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
as you think, and you
shape you brain chemistry,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
that changes the temperature
of the atoms in the vicinity.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
puts certain particles

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%
into a particular state.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But what this means if no
two particles of this type

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.530 align:middle line:90%
can be in the same state.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It means on some level
the entire universe

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
has to agree with what
you're thinking about.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The entire universe must know
on some weird level what you're

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
doing, otherwise
there's a possibility

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that another particle
can be the same state.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But that's not allowed by
the rules of quantum physics.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So on some level the
entire universe must know,

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:84%
it must be somehow
aware of everything

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:90%
that's going on right now.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Which then brings us to the
cause and effect, which means

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.060 align:middle line:84%
that every time we
change a decision,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:84%
it has an effect on the
future and on others

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
lives, our planet.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the
challenges mainstream

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
physicists often present when
people in the spiritual mind

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
body spirit field talk
about entanglement,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
physicists use the argument
that you can't exactly

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
send a message from one
particle to another, like a text

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:90%
message kind of thing.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
beginning to understand

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:84%
is if you go even
deeper, there's

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
a growing body of
scientists, including

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.331 align:middle line:84%
myself, who would suggest
that the universe isn't inept.

00:24:08.331 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not dead.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not random fluctuations
in the quantum field

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that create the
quarks, but perhaps

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
at the deepest fabric of reality
itself, the universe is alive.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And as preposterous as that may
sound to mainstream, by making

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that assumption is
one of the only ways

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you can start to understand some
of the experiments that show

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that if one person--
take a couple who

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
share a strong emotional
bond, typical experiment.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And you put you separate
them by a distance.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Put one inside an MRI scanner,
the other down the corridor.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And you flash a light in
the eyes of the one down

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
the corridor, but because
they're emotionally connected,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
what you find in
the MRI it picks up

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:84%
a flash in the visual
cortex-- that's

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
the area that processes visual
information --in their partner.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So one person saw something,
but their partner's brain

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:90%
thought they saw it.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is separated
by a distance.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
account for that is by the idea

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that your consciousness
isn't inside your head.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not produced
by brain chemistry,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:90%
which is the mainstream view.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And you start to then
arrive at a conclusion.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The only logical
conclusion is maybe

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is something more
fundamental to reality itself.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
that assumption, it

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:84%
means there's consciousness
in everything, even

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
in a blade of grass,
even a leaf on a tree

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and a piece of bark on a
tree, even a piece of stone

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:90%
that you walk on.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not suggesting it's
self aware consciousness.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean my table at home doesn't
sit up late at night to watch

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:90%
"Star Trek" with excitement.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
But there must be like a
background hum of consciousness

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:90%
in every single thing.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You probably require a neural
net in the brain to have

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
of our type of consciousness.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't include a
consciousness in everything.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
to look into the deepest

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.565 align:middle line:84%
fabric of reality, you start
to arrive at the conclusion

00:25:55.565 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps it's
alive and therefore

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:90%
everything is interconnected.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And this idea that
you can't send

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:84%
a text message, maybe
that only relates

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.215 align:middle line:90%
to protons and electrons.

00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you go Even deeper to
basic fabric of reality, then

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we're
constantly exchanging

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
information, conscious
transformation,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
with the entire universe.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe
that happens.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And these types
of MRI experiments

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to
suggest that that might

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:90%
really be how things work.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So as we are
thinking, as we are

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
living, as we are having
thousands of thoughts,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:90%
we're also impacting.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to speak,
just our own presence

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:84%
be enough to shift things?
Yeah.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, I often say to
people that if you just

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:48.250 align:middle line:84%
think a thought of
kindness, it send a ripple

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
out from you that never stops.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
is infinite.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Every scientist agrees
the universe is infinite.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, even just
the thought of kindness,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm choosing
kindness on purpose

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:84%
because I have this
idea, and many people

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
share the same idea, that
a small group of people

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
with compassion and
kindness in their hearts

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:90%
can change the world.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And I think it starts up here.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:84%
You just think
kindness, think love

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.290 align:middle line:84%
think of someone you cared about
it and it sends a little wave.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like dropping
a pebble in a pond.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Plop.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And little waves and at
the other side of the pond,

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.524 align:middle line:90%
a lily pad does that.

00:27:21.524 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's got no idea
why it's doing that,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
but the reason it's
doing that is because you

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:90%
dropped the pebble in the pond.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's the metaphor I guess.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the pebble in the
pond is a single thought

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of kindness and
love and compassion

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that sends these ripples that
go on for infinity, infinity.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So you start to feel
more empowered then.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
You start to understand that
maybe I can impact the world.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And it really just
starts in my own mind.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing away with this
idea that we're powerless

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and replacing it with this
idea of being powerful.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And that our thoughts
really carry.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.620 align:middle line:84%
They're not floaty, inert things
that disappear into the ether,

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.810 align:middle line:84%
but they always
have consequences.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.305 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you're led to
the inevitable conclusion

00:28:03.305 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm so powerful it
matters what I think about.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So therefore if you want to
make the world a better place,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
then start it in your mind more
with ideas of gratitude, ideas

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of compassion and kindness and
think of people in the best

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:84%
possible sense, instead of
dwelling on the stuff that's

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
annoying, dwelling on the people
that we don't get on with,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
dwelling on stressful
thing, dwelling on what's

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.030 align:middle line:90%
not working in our lives.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And start to focus on
the magic, on the beauty,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:90%
on the specialness of life.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And you send this
ripple out that it does

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:90%
eventually impact the world.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if many of us
think the same way,

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.366 align:middle line:90%
then the world can only change.

00:28:40.366 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to see
immediate results too.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is part
of our society.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:90%
We want to see right now.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So those thoughts
unfortunately, we

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know immediately the
impact that it will have,

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.430 align:middle line:84%
even if we meditate
10 minutes a day

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.340 align:middle line:84%
or if we have
these good thoughts

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and make those
declaration or intentions,

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you don't see it
right away and we give up.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It's so common to give
up because we're looking

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:90%
for these immediate results.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.685 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking doesn't
have an immediate result,

00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
not only do we give
up, but we start

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.400 align:middle line:90%
to feel that I have no power.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
We start to feel, surely I've
been thinking of that thing

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.580 align:middle line:90%
and nothing's happened.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.595 align:middle line:84%
I haven't changed the
world with a single thought

00:29:18.595 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:90%
so I must not be good at this.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And we disempower ourselves.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we can replace that need
for immediacy with the idea

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:90%
that there's a bit a lag time.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like if a
person is painting

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.930 align:middle line:84%
watercolor, to create an image
you have to do several washes.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.045 align:middle line:84%
So you wash over another
wash, another wash,

00:29:35.045 --> 00:29:38.094 align:middle line:84%
and gradually the image gets
darker and darker and darker,

00:29:38.094 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
until it's really real.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think to use that kind
of metaphor, that to begin

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to shape life in
a significant way,

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
we have to repeat
the same thought.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It' like the piano study
the neuroplasticity study

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, we didn't
shape brain circuits

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
by just imagining playing
the piano notes once.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We had to do the same
thing repetitively.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So maybe if we
understand that sometimes

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.080 align:middle line:84%
things will shift
with just one idea.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But many times for
the average person

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
it takes thinking the
same thing several times.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And that begins to build
patience because if we

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.220 align:middle line:84%
understand that's
probably how it works,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:84%
then we stop looking
for immediate results.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
When they come immediately,
whoa, it's a blessing.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But we don't need to
have immediate results.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So therefore we maintain
the sense of being powerful.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
You used to coach athletes?

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you still do it.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:28.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't formally anymore.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:90%
I give pieces of advice, yeah.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But while I worked
as a scientist,

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I was an athletics coach, I
coached long jump, triple jump.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, the
power of visualization,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.500 align:middle line:90%
they use it a lot.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Athletes do have coaches.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke-- and a friend
of mine is Lewis Pugh.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So he's a British athlete
and mentalist that

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:90%
swim across the North Pole.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, 2/3 of my work
has been visualizing the cold

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of the water and going
through until he was ready

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and then just being in the
water, he was prepared.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah absolutely.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.870 align:middle line:84%
When I was an
athletics coach, you

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.590 align:middle line:84%
start to understand that the
top athletes in the world, they

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:90%
all use visualization.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Usain Bolt, when
he broke the 100 meters

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
world record a few
years ago, he ran 9.58.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a preposterously fast
time, awesomely fast time.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was quoted at
the end as saying,

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I just visualized
and then run my race.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a fragment of
the volume of virtualization

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:90%
that athletes actually do.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Because of athlete visualize
themselves like swimming,

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.330 align:middle line:84%
for your friend for example,
then the brain processes

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
as if it's actually happening.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So if he's imagining
swimming in really,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:84%
really cold, then the brain
is processing it as if he can

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:90%
swim in really, really cool.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So the brain begins to
alter it's chemistry,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
alter the biological
processes in the body that

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:90%
allow him to swim in the cold.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And for an athlete who's jumping
or hurdling or sprinting,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:84%
then the conditions in which
they imagine themselves

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
performing, the brain begins
to alter the chemical processes

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
in the body so that the
body is able to do the thing

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.500 align:middle line:90%
that your imagine it doing.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:90%
What a beautiful machine.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a beautiful
machine that we are.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. we're far more
than we think we are.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:90%
The impossible seems possible.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I think we're capable of
so much more than we think.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I never cease to be
amazed at the capacity

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.850 align:middle line:84%
people have to
heal their bodies,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.870 align:middle line:84%
perform great feats of
strength and endurance

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
or to shape the
circumstances of our life,

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.180 align:middle line:84%
even when they've been in
really challenging situations.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It's important to talk
also in this conversation

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.530 align:middle line:84%
about negative feelings or
about belief system that

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:90%
are stuck in the subconscious.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a big part
of how we react.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
We react automatically
to things.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So if even though if we may
say a positive affirmation,

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:90%
we might not be aligned with it.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
What's your advice?

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.916 align:middle line:84%
I work on beliefs
quite a lot for myself.

00:32:57.916 --> 00:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We might think, I want
to get over there.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But a little belief,
a little voice,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
that we perhaps
might have picked up

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.700 align:middle line:84%
when we were younger,
children for example,

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.530 align:middle line:84%
or even another
part of our lives,

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not good enough.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve that.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking from
personal experience here.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think many of the viewers
can probably relate to this.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But I grew up in a small
village in central Scotland

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and the idea that we
are important isn't

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.620 align:middle line:84%
something that you get
in that small village

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:90%
in central Scotland.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you get the idea--
it's a small places and poverty

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is a big thing in the
village I grew up in.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So people develop this idea that
not only are they not powerful,

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
but they're not import.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in
that environment.

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to
get on in my life,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.110 align:middle line:84%
it was so frustrating
because I had these beliefs,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.030 align:middle line:90%
I can do things.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
could explain stuff.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was a good
athlete and all that.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
But this little voice kept
coming up and saying, ah,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.490 align:middle line:90%
but you're not good enough.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve that.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:90%
You're rubbish.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to think
that you could speak

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:84%
at the Hay House Conference?
this weekend?

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to think you
deserve to be on that stage?

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And that little voice, still
to this day, still to this day,

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.650 align:middle line:90%
that little voice comes up.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of public speakers,

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't write
about it, we all share

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:17.179 align:middle line:84%
the same-- we all have
our own little stuff.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And that little voice
comes up from time to time.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Who are you?

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve this.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:90%
And I have to work with that.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.055 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with it
a lot and the voice

00:34:25.055 --> 00:34:26.880 align:middle line:90%
has got quieter and quieter.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And it's belief work.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So I would write down on a
piece of paper how I'm feeling.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel this way?

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start to question
who I feel myself to be

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.389 align:middle line:84%
and why do I believe
this about myself.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And eventually uncover
some ideas about myself.

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.949 align:middle line:84%
And I replaced the
negative beliefs,

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
the disempowering little
voices, you're not good enough.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:84%
Who are you to be standing
on the stage for example.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:90%
You don't deserve this.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.424 align:middle line:84%
I replace it with
positive affirmations.

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Or you're not to.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I deserve these things.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I've said a lot is I

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.530 align:middle line:84%
live each day with
happiness and joy,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.050 align:middle line:84%
trusting only good
things come to me.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I've used affirmations like,
I am a spark of the divine.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I am part of everything
that has ever been

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.600 align:middle line:84%
and I absolutely deserve to
live a life of happiness and joy

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and have anything that I
choose to create in my life.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you say them
over and over again,

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
the brain begins to process it
as if it's actually happening.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And we move towards what
we say about ourselves.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the disempowering
beliefs work in the same way.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The little voice that comes
up all the time in our lives,

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that we don't notice
it coming out,

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.120 align:middle line:90%
but it's impacting the brain.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:90%
It's impacting the body.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And what it's doing is we're
moving towards that reality.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So when you identify
it, it empowers

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:84%
you to realize that doesn't
need to have that power.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you replace it
with something positive.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:90%
So I've often had to do that.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like, I think
many people do belief work,

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.790 align:middle line:90%
we think I've done it once.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And then things
worked for a while.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it seems an
issue comes back again.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:84%
People think, I must
have done it wrong.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm back in the same place.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.560 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the case.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Because life is cyclic.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a science
called chronobiology.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I have written about
it in my new book

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the
film "Choice Point."

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I am in that film.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And basically it shows
how cycles in the cosmos.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:90%
like the Earth spins.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.660 align:middle line:84%
As the Earth spins, the
sun goes across the sky.

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But that impacts
of biochemistry,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.730 align:middle line:84%
impacts a little
mechanism that produces

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the hormone melatonin
that causes us to sleep

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:90%
and wake and sleep and wake.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So you find many
biological processes

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.380 align:middle line:90%
are driven by cosmic cycles.

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, life will
flow in cyclic patterns.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:90%
So life will repeat itself.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Society, you see rises and
falls of civilizations,

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.970 align:middle line:84%
political swings, everything
in life and human experience

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
is cyclic.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we come back to the
same place and we think,

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought I dealt
with this belief.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I'm
in the same place.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:90%
You're not.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just as the cycles
came around again,

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:84%
you've met as a higher
version of yourself.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not that you failed.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not that you failed before.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I
say, I have dealt

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.737 align:middle line:84%
with this little voice that
says you're not good enough.

00:37:02.737 --> 00:37:04.470 align:middle line:84%
You're not good enough to
be standing on that stage.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Here we are again.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Here we are again.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I no longer give
myself a hard time and say,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
I must have done it
wrong, because I didn't.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just the cycles
came along again.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a higher
version of myself.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm speaking-- I'm
right after Wayne Dyer at the I

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Can Do It conference.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And that little voice is
coming up and saying, how can

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.370 align:middle line:90%
you hope to follow Wayne Dyer?

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's that little fear.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.325 align:middle line:84%
You're just a little wee
guy from that little village

00:37:25.325 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:90%
in Scotland.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
How do you deserve have
to be with these, speaking

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.070 align:middle line:84%
with Louise Hay and Wayne
Dyer and Anita Moorjani

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and Robert Holden and all that.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I dealt with
that kind of belief.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's just I'm a higher
version of myself now.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have the same power.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But I have to
continually-- everyone,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:84%
we always have to
continually adapt.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.531 align:middle line:84%
As the world changes, so
we have to change as well.

00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you failed,
it's just get that you're

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:90%
a higher version of yourself.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So inevitably the cycle
will come around again,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.740 align:middle line:84%
giving us an invitation to
rise to the next highest

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.900 align:middle line:90%
levels of ourselves.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when we encounter
those does difficulties

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
or those deja vus or this
situation, we say to ourselves,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.260 align:middle line:84%
no thank you.
-I can do it.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do it anyway.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I often say to myself
when fears come up,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm just going
to do it anyway.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.171 align:middle line:84%
Susan Jeffers still has that
philosophy, feel the fear

00:38:20.171 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:90%
and do it anyway.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:84%
My similar thing is
well, I'm just going

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:90%
to do it anyway regardless.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fears will come up, but
I'm just going to do it anyway.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's those cycles too
where life is just quieter

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to be
peaceful instead of go,

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.610 align:middle line:84%
go go and creating chaos,
maybe by this go, go go.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:84%
It's good to just relax.
It's OK.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It's part of life, the
cycles go like this as well.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It is part of life and you'll
notice that because sometimes

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:84%
in life, there
are many obstacles

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and things just seem
to be slowing down.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's the world,
the cycles, the universe,

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
your own consciousness,
whatever, saying, maybe this is

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.370 align:middle line:90%
an opportunity just to relax.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm not supposed to be
running all over the place.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is a period
of time that coming,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:84%
a cycle, that's
saying, just chill out.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And maybe within the chilling
out, and the relaxing,

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I will find something very
special about myself that

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:84%
is important for me to become
the next version of myself,

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
to become me in the
future for other things

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.080 align:middle line:84%
that are maybe perhaps
destined or they

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:84%
have a high level
high likelihood

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:90%
of occurring in my future.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this period of time
is necessary to shape me

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.410 align:middle line:84%
into the person I need to
become so that I can meet

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:90%
that in the best possible way.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And get the outcome that is
actually perhaps best for me

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:90%
or predestined.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.440 align:middle line:90%
So I need this period of quiet.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK and having loving
thoughts during that time is

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the most important, being
in the present moment,

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:51.291 align:middle line:84%
enjoying things, viewing
them positively, reaffirming.

00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most powerful
ways of being in the moment

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and not running about
all over the place

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is, I think there's a natural
flow of love and compassion

00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:90%
and wellness.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I've written about this
as well, that there's

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:90%
a wind behind evolution.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the wind is
compassion and kindness.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:90%
The wind is love.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And many mainstream scientists
might have a problem with that.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think I've
justified in the contents

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.350 align:middle line:90%
of what I've written about.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's an
evolution in the wind.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's consciousness.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the evolution
of consciousness

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.845 align:middle line:84%
that's driving
the whole program,

00:40:25.845 --> 00:40:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole genetic thing
that we go through.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think, when we have a
period of quiet in our lives,

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:90%
we can just tap into that.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.650 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like paddling
your boat into the current.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And how do we paddle into
that natural current?

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.620 align:middle line:90%
We be kind.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And that means in your
physical expression in life

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:84%
but also in your
head and your mind.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So think of people
in the best way.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness, if it's possible.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Exercising gentleness and
compassion with people,

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.670 align:middle line:90%
demonstrating empathy.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Just thinking of
people you love.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.720 align:middle line:84%
All of these things that
the spiritual teachers

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:90%
have been saying forever.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:84%
If we do these things in
the quite times in our life,

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.380 align:middle line:84%
then we're almost
getting into the flow,

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
so we then move in the
direction the nature

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:84%
wants to take us in
anyway without any effort

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:90%
on our own front.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the things that
are ultimately best for us

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:20.000 align:middle line:90%
will present themselves to us.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not trying
to make anything happen.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:90%
We're not resisting anything.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We're actually just being
love, compassion, and kindness.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, what
presents itself to

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:84%
us is actually what's supposed
to present itself to us.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.600 align:middle line:90%
As simple as that.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.440 align:middle line:90%
The answer is simple.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not always.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to come
across as saying,

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:90%
it's just as simple as that.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Because as everyone's different.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We all have our
own-- there isn't

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:90%
always a one size fits all.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But this general
principle, if we

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.950 align:middle line:84%
can hold this general principle
in our hearts and minds,

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
then when the uniqueness of
our own life presents us,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:84%
then it will not be exactly the
same as someone else's life.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But if we meet it with
these ideals in our minds,

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.780 align:middle line:84%
then we will find a way to
navigate through the challenges

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.260 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you for this
very juicy, inspiring

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:90%
conversation, David.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:90%
It's been my pleasure.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it finished?

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm so enjoying this.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I could go on for
another two hours.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, we'll save a little
bit of energy for tomorrow.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Because this is your big day.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I wish you a lot of fun.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll be there to watch
it at the conference.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And what a great moment.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Much, much love, my
delicious co-creators.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually here
if you're wondering,

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:84%
we're at the
citizenM in Glasgow,

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:90%
in the city center of Glasgow.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun little hotel.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually staying here
while here in the city.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of those
kind of experience also

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that induce the beauty
and the creativity

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:90%
that some people can have.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You should see the rooms
and everything is built

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:00.860 align:middle line:90%
so that there's this harmony.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.020 align:middle line:90%
And it feels good.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:90%
And you can relax.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't give
ourselves those gifts

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and now there's this whole
new generation now thinking

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:84%
differently and
bringing this really

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
ethical business out and
those wonderful things out

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's exciting
that I can report

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.250 align:middle line:84%
on another magnificent
story with you.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Much much love.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Bye, bye.
