[ Music ]

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello [inaudible]
Lilou here

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:16.283 align:middle line:84%
in actually South
California, in San Diego

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:19.153 align:middle line:84%
at the transformational
leadership council meeting here

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.287 align:middle line:90%
with you, Dawson.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.856 align:middle line:84%
I'm really excited to
have this conversation

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:24.358 align:middle line:90%
with you for Gaiam TV.

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Dawson Church: It's
yup more fun, Lilou.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:26.527 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:27.661 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So we're going to talk

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.198 align:middle line:84%
about epigenetic
energy medicine.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.801 align:middle line:84%
Really, this new biology
call it of the intention.

00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.004 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of
the Genie in Your Genes?

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:37.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Dawson Church: Yes.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:38.773 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's mine.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:40.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's a hard
title to say [chuckles].

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:41.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Dawson Church: [Chuckles]
the Genie in Your Genes, yeah.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And we're not
talking of the jeans.

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We're really talking
not the jeans.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.082 align:middle line:90%
You know, those blue jeans.

00:00:48.082 --> 00:00:48.716 align:middle line:90%
>> Dawson Church: Yes, right.

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:50.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Really.

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:54.855 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your story and how
you came across this energy work

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:57.758 align:middle line:84%
and how actually
powerful it is for people.

00:00:57.758 --> 00:00:59.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Dawson Church: It was
like pieces of a puzzle.

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.762 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to
look for more and more

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.296 align:middle line:90%
of the pieces they are there.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.032 align:middle line:84%
So, I began with my
colleague saying,

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.101 align:middle line:84%
well this energy work
is really feels good

00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:08.335 align:middle line:84%
for the patient,
good for the client.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:10.271 align:middle line:84%
But there's no real
science behind it.

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So I began to it delve deep into
the science behind this kind

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
of healing and discovered
there are literally hundreds

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.579 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of studies
showing how people heal

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.214 align:middle line:84%
if they just shift
their beliefs,

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:90%
their energy their emotions.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So, I began to go on a
detective quest to try

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.955 align:middle line:84%
and find all the
pieces of the puzzle.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:84%
And psychology had some, biology
had some, epigenetics had some

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.861 align:middle line:84%
and energy psychology has
energy medicine had some.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.764 align:middle line:84%
And as I put all
those pieces together,

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:39.766 align:middle line:84%
they fit into this amazing
tapestry that became the book,

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.701 align:middle line:90%
the Genie in Your Genes.

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.269 align:middle line:84%
So, it was like a
detective story.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
But I found that
everywhere I looked

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.905 align:middle line:90%
for evidence, it was there.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's powerful.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.775 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
It has a powerful effect on
healing and it's scientific.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So where did you start
really in showing the evidence

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
that these type of
energy medicine work?

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
>> Dawson Church:
Well, I'll leap ahead.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.155 align:middle line:84%
Rather where I started
where I end it.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:05.192 align:middle line:84%
But my most recent
research was into cortisol.

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:07.628 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is your
main stress hormone.

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:09.629 align:middle line:84%
So, if you're stressed,
you have lots

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.265 align:middle line:90%
of adrenaline, lots of cortisol.

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.434 align:middle line:84%
And your body makes that
cortisol and adrenaline

00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:14.868 align:middle line:90%
in in just a few seconds.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:18.672 align:middle line:84%
So, if I had been in a nice
relaxed state, your body is

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:90%
in a normal unstressed state.

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.944 align:middle line:84%
And then I tell you to
think a negative thought.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:25.211 align:middle line:90%
Think one negative thought.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.648 align:middle line:84%
Think about the fight
with the family member.

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:30.884 align:middle line:84%
Think about the meeting at
work that didn't go so well.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.388 align:middle line:84%
One of those negative thoughts
can instantly trigger the

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:37.324 align:middle line:84%
production of more
cortisol, more adrenaline.

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.895 align:middle line:84%
What's happening there is
this thought, this idea,

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:43.597 align:middle line:84%
this mental construct in
the front of your brain,

00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:45.699 align:middle line:84%
sends signal all
through your body.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.269 align:middle line:84%
So, first of all to your
mid brain and hind brain,

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.771 align:middle line:84%
they then tell your body
you're under stress.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.474 align:middle line:84%
Your body can't tell the
difference between that thought

00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:58.211 align:middle line:84%
of stress and an object of
stress, like a real predator

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.081 align:middle line:90%
or snake, a rabbit, dog.

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:02.449 align:middle line:90%
It can't tell the difference.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.919 align:middle line:84%
There's this thought in your
mind about the office meeting.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.121 align:middle line:84%
So that signal travels
through your body

00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.657 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you're flooded
with these stress hormones

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:90%
like adrenaline and cortisol.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:12.693 align:middle line:90%
Big big rise.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.863 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is that
thought is sending a signal

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:20.534 align:middle line:84%
to the part of your endocrine
system that uses those hormones

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:22.436 align:middle line:90%
and those genes turn on.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.072 align:middle line:90%
So as we think, literally,

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:27.041 align:middle line:84%
thousands of genes are
are being turned on

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.078 align:middle line:84%
and off throughout our body
producing enormous amounts

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:31.912 align:middle line:90%
of [inaudible].

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:34.915 align:middle line:90%
And so what I'm trying to point

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:39.353 align:middle line:84%
out is the really high
usefulness of learning

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:40.654 align:middle line:90%
to reduce that stress response.

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:44.058 align:middle line:84%
If we release the stress
response, then you shift all

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
that hormonal shift and
your body will change

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.861 align:middle line:90%
as though it happens.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.597 align:middle line:84%
Your neurology, your
brain wiring changes.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.666 align:middle line:84%
And just as you think
a negative thought

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.169 align:middle line:84%
and all this bad stuff happens,
think a positive thought

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.503 align:middle line:90%
and the reverse happens.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle line:90%
So, really, are an argument

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%
to persuade people
think positively.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:02.309 align:middle line:90%
Love. Be kind.

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.944 align:middle line:90%
Meditate. Do energy medicine.

00:04:03.944 --> 00:04:06.814 align:middle line:84%
Do all these things and they
are having powerful affects

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:08.048 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.484 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And can you
measure that scientifically?

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.418 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Absolutely.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.821 align:middle line:84%
We did one study
recently published

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:15.889 align:middle line:90%
in a top tier medical journal.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.594 align:middle line:84%
And we had people we gave people
a form of therapy called EFT

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:21.795 align:middle line:90%
or emotional freedom techniques.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.564 align:middle line:84%
So it tapping, so
called tapping.

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:26.633 align:middle line:84%
Because it involves tapping on
acupuncture points in your body.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.268 align:middle line:90%
Tap to these points.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.872 align:middle line:84%
And we gave people an hour of
either talk therapy regular,

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:34.675 align:middle line:84%
signature with a therapist
having a discussion, you know,

00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:36.043 align:middle line:90%
having to work with you.

00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.045 align:middle line:90%
Or an hour of EFT.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.513 align:middle line:90%
Or just rest.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:42.683 align:middle line:84%
We found that in the group
that got EFT, their depression

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:45.619 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety symptoms
dropped in one hour by more

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.521 align:middle line:90%
than double talk therapy.

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.089 align:middle line:90%
So, by doing the tapping

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.592 align:middle line:84%
on the acupuncture press
points had a huge effect

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:53.794 align:middle line:90%
psychologically, but their level

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:56.663 align:middle line:84%
of cortisol dropped
by 24 percent.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.065 align:middle line:90%
Your main stress hormone,

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:01.568 align:middle line:84%
your main aging hormone
dropped 24 percent in an hour.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:90%
It was an amazing result.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.273 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the lab who
was doing the testing

00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:08.542 align:middle line:84%
as we're mailing our first
batch of tests, I was supposed

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.244 align:middle line:84%
to present them to a
medical conference.

00:05:10.244 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I mailed all the tests
to the lab but I was hoping

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.649 align:middle line:84%
to put the other test
[inaudible] conference.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.285 align:middle line:84%
And the lab didn't e
mail me back the results.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:20.988 align:middle line:84%
And I began to pest them,
saying, "Where are my results?

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing this conference,
I need these results."

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.525 align:middle line:90%
And a week went by.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.094 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks went by
and no results.

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:30.998 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, I got really,
you know, upset at the lab.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.733 align:middle line:90%
My cortisol rising myself.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:34.935 align:middle line:84%
I told the lab, "What's
going on there?"

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:38.772 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Dr. Church,
your results are anomalous.

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:40.507 align:middle line:90%
Cortisol does not drop this far.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We've done tens of
thousands of cortisol tests.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.645 align:middle line:90%
These results are impossible.

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been recalibrating our
equipment, rerunning the tests

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.349 align:middle line:84%
because cortisol
cannot drop that fast."

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.651 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:53.454 align:middle line:84%
I mean, much faster than any
kind of a normal response.

00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:56.623 align:middle line:84%
So as your anxiety
and depression drops,

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:59.426 align:middle line:84%
your stress hormones,
like cortisol, drop.

00:05:59.426 --> 00:06:02.796 align:middle line:84%
And also your rejuvenation
hormones, like the HTA, rise.

00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a powerful effect,
both for reducing stress

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.369 align:middle line:84%
and promoting the
healthful exchange

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:13.307 align:middle line:90%
of biochemical in your body.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:16.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you because
during this what happens

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:21.315 align:middle line:84%
actually during an energy
or healing or the tapping?

00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.083 align:middle line:84%
Because right now
you just said EFT.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:26.186 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure there's other
first, what other type

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:28.789 align:middle line:84%
of modalities are we
talking about here?

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:29.756 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: There are lots of them.

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:31.558 align:middle line:84%
There are energy
medicine modalities.

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:90%
There's also one called EMDR,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.028 align:middle line:84%
which is very effective
for PTSD.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:37.831 align:middle line:84%
EMDR and EFT works seem to
work very similarly in terms

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.967 align:middle line:84%
of outcomes in the
people that get them.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:84%
And this whole big world
of energy medicine,

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:43.136 align:middle line:84%
that there are many
different techniques.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:47.574 align:middle line:84%
I use EFT because
it's hard to do badly.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:90%
So, it's simple and fast.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you don't speak of
the reconnection or other things

00:06:52.946 --> 00:06:54.281 align:middle line:84%
that can go through
people's head

00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
or [inaudible] or
things like that?

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.252 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: Only things that we
can measure scientifically.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.621 align:middle line:84%
And some of those we may be
able to measure in the future,

00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:04.358 align:middle line:84%
but until I see the research,
I just don't know, you know?

00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And so the
intention from which

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.698 align:middle line:84%
that the healing is
done has a huge impact

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
on the results, right?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.169 align:middle line:90%
Can you measure intention?

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.671 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: You can measure
intention,

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.307 align:middle line:84%
and my friend [inaudible]
actually has done

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.843 align:middle line:90%
that in terms of our results.

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:27.814 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, with cortisol,
you can measure mental states.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.917 align:middle line:84%
So, if you have a
positive mental state,

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.718 align:middle line:84%
you'll tend to have
a lower cortisol.

00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
If you have a negative
mental state,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.454 align:middle line:90%
you'll raise the cortisol.

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:37.591 align:middle line:84%
And so, anything we do that
intention just feeling good

00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in various ways will
help us physiologically.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.263 align:middle line:84%
It'll measure the effects of
the body of your thoughts.

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:48.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So what are some
of the chapters in this book?

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:49.369 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Well

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:50.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: To healing
and to epigenetics

00:07:50.904 --> 00:07:52.072 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yeah.

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.407 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is so
interesting because it shows

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:57.144 align:middle line:84%
that as we have influences
from outside the cell

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.581 align:middle line:84%
that this affects our gene
expression, the old model

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle line:84%
of gene expression was that
all the informations are

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:90%
in the genes.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.618 align:middle line:90%
That's where it comes from.

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:07.254 align:middle line:84%
And that then terms
our biological fate.

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:09.022 align:middle line:84%
We now know that that
is not at all true.

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:11.558 align:middle line:84%
That what we think, what we
feel, are strong emotions.

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.026 align:middle line:84%
Especially, if you
believe something strongly,

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:15.896 align:middle line:84%
you have a strong emotion behind
it, you literally send signals

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.798 align:middle line:90%
that shift your gene expression.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.833 align:middle line:84%
So, we now know that
stress especially,

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.869 align:middle line:84%
plays a hugely important
role in gene expression.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:26.573 align:middle line:84%
And one of the favorite
ways of looking at this is,

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:28.241 align:middle line:84%
is looking at twins,
identical twins.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.811 align:middle line:84%
And identical twins are
born with the same genome.

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
So they have two babies
born, identical twins

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.181 align:middle line:90%
from the exactly the same genes.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Identical genes.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.885 align:middle line:84%
So you think they'd
have the same diseases,

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.454 align:middle line:90%
they would die the same time.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:41.787 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.057 align:middle line:84%
One might get cancer,
one might not get cancer.

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:45.659 align:middle line:90%
One might get heart disease.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:46.860 align:middle line:90%
One might not.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.963 align:middle line:84%
On average, according to
the [inaudible] institute,

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:52.199 align:middle line:90%
they die ten years apart.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:55.035 align:middle line:84%
So, really different health
outcomes with the same genomes.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.236 align:middle line:90%
So, what's going on there?

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:59.506 align:middle line:84%
Mostly stress environmental
stress.

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:01.775 align:middle line:84%
But mental stress
plays a huge role.

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.877 align:middle line:84%
And so our genes are
being powerfully affected

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:06.580 align:middle line:84%
from outside the cell,
outside the body even,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.348 align:middle line:90%
by our stress levels.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:09.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Tell us
about the DNA too.

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.118 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear a
lot about that.

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:12.919 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
looked into this

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle line:84%
but this supposedly junk
part of the DNA and its role

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.761 align:middle line:84%
into us living this
really purposeful, fun,

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.397 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible] life
without this less stress

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.566 align:middle line:90%
and more in the flow.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.469 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: Well, that whole idea
of junk DNA is really more

00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:33.773 align:middle line:84%
like junk science because
that was just a label

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:34.975 align:middle line:90%
for what we didn't know.

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.877 align:middle line:84%
So we thought we don't
know, we had the arrogance

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.345 align:middle line:84%
to think we don't
know what it does,

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:90%
therefore it has no function.

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:45.252 align:middle line:84%
And so, science unfortunately is
full of that kind of arrogance.

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:47.387 align:middle line:90%
And rather than the humility

00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
at this amazingly complex
biological both in our bodies

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.395 align:middle line:90%
and the world that we see.

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:90%
So, it takes a while to figure

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.132 align:middle line:84%
out what it all does,
but we eventually do.

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.233 align:middle line:90%
But

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:02.202 align:middle line:84%
Often we see things
happening in practice.

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:04.771 align:middle line:84%
A long time before we know
how they work scientifically.

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Like, [inaudible] for example

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.475 align:middle line:84%
or these other kinds
of energy healing.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:09.142 align:middle line:90%
How do they work?

00:10:09.142 --> 00:10:10.243 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:11.678 align:middle line:84%
But they do work,
we can see that.

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:14.915 align:middle line:84%
But, that's no excuse not
to investigate them or not

00:10:14.915 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:84%
to use them if they
do work and a say.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.286 align:middle line:84%
For example, we didn't
know how aspirin worked

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.188 align:middle line:90%
for a century, two centuries.

00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:22.389 align:middle line:90%
And we used it.

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.857 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know [inaudible]
work prevent malaria.

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:26.626 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so all through the
history of medicine and science,

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:28.228 align:middle line:84%
we have all kinds
of technologies

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:29.996 align:middle line:90%
that they work and we use them.

00:10:29.996 --> 00:10:32.232 align:middle line:84%
We only think about how
they work much later.

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:33.867 align:middle line:84%
And energy medicine
is one of those.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So now [inaudible] oh,
inspecting cortisol.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.039 align:middle line:84%
So now we are starting to figure
out how it works in the body.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.708 align:middle line:84%
But we know that it
works for a long time.

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:43.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And the DNA?

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.012 align:middle line:84%
Then what could it did you
look into that or have an idea

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:47.714 align:middle line:90%
of which role it plays?

00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:49.916 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: I think we'll gradually
figure out more and more

00:10:49.916 --> 00:10:51.852 align:middle line:90%
and more about how DNA works.

00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:56.623 align:middle line:84%
About how other parts
of the cell function

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.592 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] works
on the DNA.

00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:01.795 align:middle line:84%
Like, we now know that certain
proteins trigger certain kinds

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:90%
of DNA expression.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.466 align:middle line:84%
We know that especially RNA
we thought it was just kind

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.368 align:middle line:90%
of a [inaudible] molecule.

00:11:08.368 --> 00:11:12.472 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we thought that
RNA played a limited role

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
in gene expression.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, it turns out that RNA
can trigger the expression

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of certain genes and even
help create certain proteins.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.915 align:middle line:90%
So our

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:22.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: RNA stands for?

00:11:22.916 --> 00:11:24.651 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I'm not familiar
with that term.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Ribonucleic acid, RNA.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:84%
The model is that
the DNA splits.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.862 align:middle line:84%
You know, the DNA
strand brakes apart.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:39.065 align:middle line:84%
And then RNA is an immediate
molecule that carries

00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:41.168 align:middle line:84%
that information to
another part of a cell.

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:42.769 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's a temporary
molecule.

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:44.938 align:middle line:84%
But now we've discovered,
this temporary molecule,

00:11:44.938 --> 00:11:47.808 align:middle line:84%
which we thought was
just a very lowly link

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
in the biological chain,
now is really important.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.945 align:middle line:84%
So with each layer
of understanding,

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.047 align:middle line:84%
we realize the body is more
complex far more complex

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:55.115 align:middle line:90%
than we believed.

00:11:55.115 --> 00:11:57.784 align:middle line:84%
As when you have a
certain thought, Lilou,

00:11:57.784 --> 00:12:00.487 align:middle line:90%
if you just have a for example.

00:12:00.487 --> 00:12:03.023 align:middle line:84%
Think about a pleasant
experience you had.

00:12:03.023 --> 00:12:06.693 align:middle line:84%
Having that memory that pleasant
experience is sending signals

00:12:06.693 --> 00:12:09.396 align:middle line:84%
all through your body to change
your biological processes.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.199 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about a bad experience
is doing the same thing.

00:12:12.199 --> 00:12:15.202 align:middle line:84%
As you flood your mind as it
becomes mindful for example,

00:12:15.202 --> 00:12:17.504 align:middle line:84%
do [inaudible] meditation,
do EFT.

00:12:17.504 --> 00:12:19.673 align:middle line:84%
Do all these things that
support your health.

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:21.107 align:middle line:90%
You're having profound effects

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:23.877 align:middle line:84%
on your most basic
levels of physiology.

00:12:23.877 --> 00:12:27.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And does
it fix the RNA, too?

00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:28.615 align:middle line:90%
Do you get into that?

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:30.016 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: I don't in the book.

00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:37.123 align:middle line:84%
But what I do show in the book
is that if you take an MRI scan,

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.759 align:middle line:84%
see the look at that MRI scan,
and it shows what's happening

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.161 align:middle line:84%
in different regions
of the brain.

00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:43.296 align:middle line:84%
See all these brain regions
and see how they're lit up

00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:45.832 align:middle line:90%
or not lit up in an MRI.

00:12:45.832 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
What is also happening is

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.237 align:middle line:84%
that there's all this magnetic
information being generated

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:53.473 align:middle line:84%
outside of our bodies
in an MRI as well.

00:12:53.473 --> 00:12:56.576 align:middle line:84%
An MRI photograph, certainly
MRI's and vast MRI's,

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:58.211 align:middle line:84%
showing the fields
outside of bodies.

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.881 align:middle line:84%
They look they are full of
color, they're full of movement

00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.817 align:middle line:84%
as we think and feel and
experience and believe.

00:13:03.817 --> 00:13:06.253 align:middle line:84%
This whole beautiful
energy field outside

00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:08.788 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies is being
affected as well.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:13.793 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, when we
do an MRI exam of the patient,

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.129 align:middle line:90%
we simply clip all that away

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:84%
and look only what
happens inside their skull.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.166 align:middle line:84%
We read the MRI inside
their skull

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.935 align:middle line:90%
and discard all the information

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:23.637 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
in their field.

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:25.372 align:middle line:84%
But the field is huge
and extends a lot more

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:29.709 align:middle line:84%
than the human body and is full
of detailed information as well.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What role
does it play there

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:33.513 align:middle line:84%
in the energy work
then to have such a

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:37.918 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: For example, our
hearts fields, or the fields

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:39.886 align:middle line:90%
of our biological heart, extends

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:42.489 align:middle line:84%
about 50 feet away
from our bodies.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.558 align:middle line:84%
So, four meters I guess
away from our bodies.

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:47.193 align:middle line:84%
So, as I'm sitting
with you here,

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.195 align:middle line:84%
our heart's field
are retracting.

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.665 align:middle line:84%
Our brain's fields
are retracting.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:55.135 align:middle line:84%
We're having not just a local
experience with each other

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:84%
in what we can see
with each other,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.106 align:middle line:84%
we're having an invisible
energy field experience as well.

00:14:00.106 --> 00:14:01.708 align:middle line:90%
And that's affecting us.

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
When for example you speak
to another human being speak

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.279 align:middle line:90%
to a friend your voice changes.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:07.747 align:middle line:90%
Your skin tone changes.

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:09.983 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of physiological
things is changed

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:14.554 align:middle line:84%
when you are interacting with
somebody you appreciate or love.

00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:17.791 align:middle line:84%
And so, our fields are
attracting in that way.

00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:19.893 align:middle line:84%
All our fields are retracting
all the time as we get closer

00:14:19.893 --> 00:14:22.996 align:middle line:84%
to each other our fields
exchange information.

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:26.099 align:middle line:84%
So these fields are really
important and how to use them

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:31.271 align:middle line:84%
for healing and not
just for reading them.

00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But also, how do you
affect those fields?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.077 align:middle line:84%
For example, one study
showed that if somebody

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:41.548 align:middle line:84%
in a coherent mindful state
offers a healing medicine

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.216 align:middle line:84%
treatment to another
human being,

00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:46.653 align:middle line:84%
that they actually entrain that
person's field to their field.

00:14:46.653 --> 00:14:49.889 align:middle line:84%
So a sick person maybe
with pain or headache,

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.125 align:middle line:84%
their field is entrained
by the field of the healer.

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:53.259 align:middle line:90%
Really remarkable stuff.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.795 align:middle line:84%
Another famous of its
studies is a 70's show

00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:58.832 align:middle line:84%
that when healers are
at a healing state

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:01.501 align:middle line:84%
when they're actually
offering healing

00:15:01.501 --> 00:15:04.237 align:middle line:90%
for the people they synchronize

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:09.009 align:middle line:84%
with the earth's predominant
frequency of so, what we do is

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:11.945 align:middle line:84%
when we're in the
healing states,

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.681 align:middle line:84%
when we're in certainly
deep sleep.

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:18.218 align:middle line:84%
When we're in highly creative
states, our brains are

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:21.921 align:middle line:84%
in this place where we sort of
communicate with each other.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.558 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're receiving
a transferring energy

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:28.061 align:middle line:84%
from each other all the time
in these invisible ways.

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:31.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I really
like the EDMR and how

00:15:31.164 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
through the eye movements
it's kind

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.536 align:middle line:84%
of can we say it's
close to hypnosis.

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:39.272 align:middle line:84%
And to get to the
subconscious area?

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yeah.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.812 align:middle line:84%
Because in hypnosis and in
those kind of deep states,

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:48.948 align:middle line:84%
are our brain waves slow down
to the two slowest waves,

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:90%
which are theta and delta.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.887 align:middle line:84%
So, when we're in under hypnosis
when we're in deep sleep,

00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:55.355 align:middle line:84%
our brains are all
in theta and delta.

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.157 align:middle line:84%
When we're in a state
of learning,

00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:58.491 align:middle line:90%
we are in theta and delta.

00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:02.328 align:middle line:84%
When we are healing,
we're in that state.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:05.432 align:middle line:84%
When we're in alpha,
and especially in beta,

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:09.269 align:middle line:84%
the higher frequencies, we're
in the province of thought.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:90%
You're thinking.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.139 align:middle line:84%
Your conscious mind
is very very reactive.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.408 align:middle line:84%
Children at the age of
about six are primarily

00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:16.376 align:middle line:90%
in theta and delta.

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:17.844 align:middle line:84%
They're in the super
learning state

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:21.214 align:middle line:84%
because that was very
useful in [inaudible] terms.

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:84%
We're absorbing all
such information

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.654 align:middle line:84%
So, kids 0 to 6 are
essentially in theta

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:31.591 align:middle line:84%
and delta absorbing all this
material about how to survive.

00:16:31.591 --> 00:16:33.827 align:middle line:84%
How do you fit with
the norms of the tribe?

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.229 align:middle line:90%
How do you please your parents?

00:16:36.229 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you find food?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.533 align:middle line:84%
All of these skills
are being taught then

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:41.835 align:middle line:90%
when they're in this state.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:45.238 align:middle line:84%
Later on we develop alpha
and then more and more beta.

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Then we start to think
and have this relation.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.242 align:middle line:84%
But at early stages,
we don't have that.

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:51.811 align:middle line:84%
And also when we're sort of
in this highly creative state

00:16:51.811 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
or learning state or under
hypnosis, we also have are just

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:58.318 align:middle line:84%
in theta and delta, those
two slow brain waves.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:17:02.755 align:middle line:84%
So, this is sort of showing us
that we are beings of energy.

00:17:02.755 --> 00:17:06.192 align:middle line:84%
And that as we shift our
beliefs, our thoughts,

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.195 align:middle line:84%
are intentions that all of
these things are shifting along

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:10.196 align:middle line:90%
with it as well.

00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:11.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You must
love [inaudible].

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.832 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you had many
conversations with him.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Last week.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.168 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: [Chuckles] I love him.

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:16.735 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yes.

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:90%
He's amazing.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.338 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:19.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, how is
your work different

00:17:19.606 --> 00:17:21.841 align:middle line:90%
or what piece do you bring in?

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:24.778 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of conversation
do you have when you two talk?

00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:25.445 align:middle line:90%
[Chuckles]

00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:26.279 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yeah.

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:27.647 align:middle line:90%
We have very interesting talks.

00:17:27.647 --> 00:17:35.188 align:middle line:84%
And Bruce, really, in his
books, paints a graphic picture

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:37.357 align:middle line:84%
of the role of energy
and healing.

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:40.493 align:middle line:84%
And what my focus is,
I want to get this

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:42.462 align:middle line:90%
into mainstream medicine.

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I love seeing it in
individual therapy practices

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and in clinics.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.305 align:middle line:90%
I want to see it in hospitals.

00:17:52.305 --> 00:17:54.207 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
one doctor I met

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:58.878 align:middle line:84%
at a conference a few years
back said to me, "I learned EFT

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:00.613 align:middle line:90%
at last year's conference.

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:03.383 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's part of our intake
at our medical clinic."

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:04.584 align:middle line:90%
They come in patients come

00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.252 align:middle line:84%
in they get a long
intake interview.

00:18:06.252 --> 00:18:07.887 align:middle line:90%
They do EFT with patients.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
What they find is that their
levels of pain often go down.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.325 align:middle line:84%
Certainly anxiety and
depression go down.

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:15.028 align:middle line:84%
And then they treat the
real medical problem rather

00:18:15.028 --> 00:18:17.030 align:middle line:90%
than the overlay of the problem.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.233 align:middle line:84%
One patient, for example, I
worked with demonstration.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:21.634 align:middle line:90%
He had a broken leg.

00:18:21.634 --> 00:18:24.671 align:middle line:84%
So, the guy volunteered to work
with me on stage if in front

00:18:24.671 --> 00:18:26.139 align:middle line:90%
of a whole bunch of people.

00:18:26.139 --> 00:18:29.576 align:middle line:84%
And he had a recent
fracture of his left leg.

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:31.277 align:middle line:90%
He was on crutches.

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:34.647 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
how could this be emotional?

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:36.883 align:middle line:90%
How could this be anything to do

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:39.285 align:middle line:84%
with how can energy
healing possibly help them?

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bone fracture.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.155 align:middle line:90%
It's two weeks old.

00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he's in pain.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.928 align:middle line:84%
So, I asked him on a scale of
0 to 10 how big his pain was,

00:18:48.928 --> 00:18:50.296 align:middle line:84%
and it was an eight
out of a ten.

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.297 align:middle line:90%
So, a lot of pain.

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:52.966 align:middle line:90%
Recent bone fracture.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:56.436 align:middle line:84%
And the skeptical
part of me said,

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:59.305 align:middle line:84%
"I don't think energy
medicine can help him."

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:03.243 align:middle line:84%
But in EFT on him and
his level of pain went

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:05.044 align:middle line:90%
from an eight to a two.

00:19:05.044 --> 00:19:06.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What was the EFT on?

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:07.513 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: EFT well

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:08.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What was it on?

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:10.116 align:middle line:90%
What was the sentence?

00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:12.552 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: What it was on was

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:15.021 align:middle line:84%
on all the emotional
factors around the fracture.

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:19.759 align:middle line:84%
For example, he got the bone
fracture driving his car.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.729 align:middle line:84%
And his wife wanted him
to go to this event.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to go.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.665 align:middle line:90%
He felt forced to go.

00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:28.434 align:middle line:84%
He felt coerced to go to
the event by his wife.

00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:29.569 align:middle line:90%
So, guess what?

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.704 align:middle line:84%
He had an accident and
didn't get to the event.

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:33.706 align:middle line:84%
He was resentful
toward his wife.

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.275 align:middle line:84%
He was angry at the
other drivers.

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:36.376 align:middle line:90%
He was angry with the doctor.

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:38.611 align:middle line:84%
He felt the hospital
hadn't performed well.

00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So all these layers
are resentment,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.548 align:middle line:90%
anger, blame and so on.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:90%
These are all emotional.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.786 align:middle line:84%
Once we tackled those
away, he was onto a two.

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:48.488 align:middle line:90%
That's the real physical pain

00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:52.425 align:middle line:84%
that the overt pain
initially was innate.

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:55.895 align:middle line:84%
So, six points of that eight
was emotional factors anger,

00:19:55.895 --> 00:20:00.466 align:middle line:84%
are blame, criticism,
self-blame.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.769 align:middle line:84%
He was blaming himself
for having been coerced

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
into doing something
he didn't want to do.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So, he probably been had
the habit his whole life

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.677 align:middle line:84%
of doing things for
these other people.

00:20:10.677 --> 00:20:13.112 align:middle line:84%
You know? And shorting
his own needs.

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:15.181 align:middle line:84%
So, all of these things
are emotional and they show

00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
up in our body as
physical pain, as diseases.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.719 align:middle line:84%
But they're hugely
linked to our emotions.

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:21.421 align:middle line:84%
And when you work
with energy medicine

00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.789 align:middle line:90%
on the emotional aspects,

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:25.158 align:middle line:84%
the physical aspects
don't necessarily go away,

00:20:25.158 --> 00:20:28.094 align:middle line:84%
but then they're shrugged to
what they really are rather

00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:32.231 align:middle line:84%
than being compounded by the
overlay of emotional stress.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.335 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, did that
just was that subconscious?

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.403 align:middle line:84%
All of this was happening
on the subconscious level?

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:38.771 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yes.

00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:42.909 align:middle line:84%
And consciously, he just felt
an eight out of a ten pain.

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.243 align:middle line:90%
That was his conscious.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.379 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know it was
going on but as I probed,

00:20:46.379 --> 00:20:47.747 align:middle line:90%
as I tapped with him,

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
as he released all the emotional
stuff suddenly, ah you know?

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.819 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:52.819 --> 00:20:55.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I feel that a lot of
people doing EFT, but they kind

00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:57.657 align:middle line:90%
of I mean, a big thing seems

00:20:57.657 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to be actually giving a
diagnosis too and knowing how

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to head back knowing and
peel all those layers.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.234 align:middle line:84%
It's not something maybe people
are tapping away some things

00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that don't really
need tapping, maybe?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.773 align:middle line:84%
Are we going the right track
when we do that by our own

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.241 align:middle line:90%
or it's just harmless?

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.877 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: It's harmless,
but it does help

00:21:17.877 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
if you're working seriously on
the issue to find those things.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.348 align:middle line:90%
What are the patterns there?

00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:25.017 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
his pattern of giving

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.387 align:middle line:84%
into his wife's demands
echoed him giving

00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:28.187 align:middle line:90%
into his mother's demands.

00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.455 align:middle line:90%
And it does take some skill

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle line:84%
to find those layers
and tap on them.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:35.795 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't do that,
Lilou, think if you just carry

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:39.298 align:middle line:84%
that load of suffering
throughout your whole life?

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:41.768 align:middle line:84%
Making yourself sick,
being in pain.

00:21:41.768 --> 00:21:43.503 align:middle line:84%
The penalty for not
doing it, you know?

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:45.972 align:middle line:84%
The penalty for not releasing
the emotion is carrying

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.174 align:middle line:84%
that stress forward
and aging your body.

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:50.543 align:middle line:84%
So, cortisol is our
main aging hormone.

00:21:50.543 --> 00:21:52.678 align:middle line:84%
We age faster if we
have lots of cortisol.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:55.948 align:middle line:84%
And so, if that person didn't
address those emotional aspects

00:21:55.948 --> 00:22:00.119 align:middle line:84%
of his pain and carried
those old early experiences

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:03.055 align:middle line:84%
through to the present,
day by day.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.992 align:middle line:84%
And these of relationships that
is putting a burden of stress

00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:08.227 align:middle line:84%
on his body that
needn't be there.

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:10.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Most people don't
see those events happening

00:22:10.797 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
in their life as linked
to some of that, huh?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.835 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a big conversation.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:19.605 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be, those people
that try to use that old way

00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:23.176 align:middle line:84%
of those medicines, or
the traditional way.

00:22:23.176 --> 00:22:24.744 align:middle line:84%
And you're not pushing
that away.

00:22:24.744 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
You're just saying and if
there was another solution.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.482 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Oh, by all means.

00:22:29.482 --> 00:22:31.984 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things I've
written about in the past is how

00:22:31.984 --> 00:22:35.388 align:middle line:84%
to work with both your
conventional medical doctor

00:22:35.388 --> 00:22:37.457 align:middle line:84%
and therapist and
psychiatrist, medication and so

00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:39.158 align:middle line:90%
on an alternative medicine.

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:41.994 align:middle line:84%
You do those well, you get the
best of both possible worlds.

00:22:41.994 --> 00:22:44.397 align:middle line:84%
You treat those things
emotionally and spiritually.

00:22:44.397 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:90%
There are spiritual emotions.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.767 align:middle line:84%
And those things that are
medical, that are medical.

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:50.136 align:middle line:84%
So, you need the best of
all those, those worlds.

00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:51.437 align:middle line:90%
Not just, you know.

00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you hear somebody
say, my method is fantastic

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.075 align:middle line:90%
and it replaces all others.

00:22:56.075 --> 00:22:57.443 align:middle line:84%
You know there's
something wrong there.

00:22:57.443 --> 00:22:59.245 align:middle line:84%
Because you need all these
different forms of healing.

00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:00.413 align:middle line:90%
They're all appropriate.

00:23:00.413 --> 00:23:02.081 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, it
might work with veterans,

00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:06.486 align:middle line:84%
I've now done lots of work with
thousands of people with PTSD.

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:09.622 align:middle line:84%
And analyzed the data,
done treatments with them.

00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can you give as ideas
of post traumatic syndromes?

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:14.193 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Stress disorder, yes.

00:23:14.193 --> 00:23:18.698 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. There are about 479,000
Vietnam veterans with PTSD

00:23:18.698 --> 00:23:21.868 align:middle line:84%
in the U.S. and over
half a million

00:23:21.868 --> 00:23:24.537 align:middle line:84%
from Afghanistan
and Iraq with PTSD.

00:23:24.537 --> 00:23:29.942 align:middle line:84%
And over time they have
higher rates of suicide.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:33.779 align:middle line:84%
A veteran commits suicide
roughly every 90 minutes.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.415 align:middle line:84%
So we have about 8,000
veterans suicides a year

00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:39.852 align:middle line:84%
in the U.S. huge numbers
of U.S. veterans suicides.

00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:42.321 align:middle line:84%
Very high level anxiety,
depression

00:23:42.321 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:90%
and physical problems.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.093 align:middle line:84%
The very high utilizers
of medical services

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:48.628 align:middle line:90%
because they are they're sick.

00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:50.329 align:middle line:84%
You know? They get
sick after a while.

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:52.965 align:middle line:84%
PTSD isn't just a
psychological problem.

00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:55.701 align:middle line:84%
It shows on their bodies
in all kind of ways.

00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:59.205 align:middle line:84%
And we found through
EFT, six [inaudible]

00:23:59.205 --> 00:24:01.007 align:middle line:90%
of EFT with these veterans.

00:24:01.007 --> 00:24:04.744 align:middle line:84%
Six sessions produces
them dropping below

00:24:04.744 --> 00:24:06.345 align:middle line:90%
that PTSD baseline.

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:10.383 align:middle line:84%
So they no longer test positive
PTSD after those six sessions.

00:24:10.383 --> 00:24:13.119 align:middle line:84%
And we find it works
for roughly 86 percent

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.387 align:middle line:90%
of those the veterans.

00:24:14.387 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So, six sessions and they
woke up and they're gone.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.126 align:middle line:84%
So, we've done this with
lots and lots of people.

00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:22.962 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine what these veterans
were carrying that burden

00:24:22.962 --> 00:24:24.764 align:middle line:84%
with them throughout
their lives.

00:24:24.764 --> 00:24:26.098 align:middle line:90%
They would suffer terribly.

00:24:26.098 --> 00:24:30.503 align:middle line:84%
And our strong motivation
is to prevent

00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:33.506 align:middle line:90%
and shift that suffering.

00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:36.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So I know that you're
a transformational leader.

00:24:36.242 --> 00:24:39.445 align:middle line:84%
So you're really bringing
this into the hospitals.

00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:40.546 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yes.

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:42.114 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there a
methodology to do that?

00:24:42.114 --> 00:24:43.983 align:middle line:90%
Are you moving forward?

00:24:43.983 --> 00:24:48.554 align:middle line:84%
Are the America doctors open
to these kind of practices?

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:50.289 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: I lectured at
many medical conferences.

00:24:50.289 --> 00:24:53.559 align:middle line:84%
And what I say is, we need
to treat emotional issues

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:56.562 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual issues with
spiritual and emotional means

00:24:56.562 --> 00:24:58.731 align:middle line:84%
and medical issues
with medical means.

00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:02.835 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see a whole room full
of doctors nodding their heads.

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:05.738 align:middle line:90%
Doctors know very well that many

00:25:05.738 --> 00:25:07.607 align:middle line:84%
of their patient's
problems are emotional

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:10.209 align:middle line:84%
and are spiritual
and are not medical.

00:25:10.209 --> 00:25:13.079 align:middle line:90%
Not at the material level.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:17.917 align:middle line:84%
And so they really, I found, are
supportive of proper medication,

00:25:17.917 --> 00:25:19.685 align:middle line:90%
proper medical attention.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:84%
But then also, teaching
patient's stress relief,

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:23.889 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.358 align:middle line:90%
Simple forms of stress relief.

00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:26.092 align:middle line:90%
Like, mindfulness.

00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:26.726 align:middle line:90%
Like, heart methods.

00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:28.027 align:middle line:90%
Like, EFT.

00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:30.396 align:middle line:84%
So, the health care
worker study we did,

00:25:30.396 --> 00:25:35.234 align:middle line:84%
it was 216 psychotherapists,
doctors, nurses, chiropractors,

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:38.204 align:middle line:84%
alternative medicine workers
at five medical conferences,

00:25:38.204 --> 00:25:40.773 align:middle line:90%
who got one day, EFT intensive.

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:43.342 align:middle line:84%
And their levels of anxiety
and depression dropped

00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:45.411 align:middle line:90%
by an average of 45 percent.

00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:49.482 align:middle line:84%
So, a 45 percent drop in mental
health problems in just one day.

00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:51.517 align:middle line:90%
Really really powerful effect.

00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:53.619 align:middle line:84%
Also, their physical
pain dropped

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:55.421 align:middle line:90%
by an average of 68 percent.

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:58.591 align:middle line:84%
So, two thirds dropped
in physical pain.

00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.326 align:middle line:84%
Not working on their
physical pain but working

00:26:00.326 --> 00:26:01.761 align:middle line:90%
on their emotional issues.

00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:05.731 align:middle line:84%
On their sense of burnout, their
sensuality, their conflicts

00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:09.001 align:middle line:84%
with superiors, are their
difficulties balancing their

00:26:09.001 --> 00:26:11.337 align:middle line:84%
personal and their
professional lives.

00:26:11.337 --> 00:26:13.339 align:middle line:84%
All of those professional
factors were really a

00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.809 align:middle line:84%
contributor to their
physical pain.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.711 align:middle line:84%
We also looked at the
level of cravings,

00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:90%
with things like chocolate.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.014 align:middle line:90%
You know, cigarettes.

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:23.382 align:middle line:90%
You know, tobacco, alcohol.

00:26:23.382 --> 00:26:24.617 align:middle line:90%
All those things.

00:26:24.617 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And their cravings dropped
an amazing 83 percent

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.423 align:middle line:90%
after about a half hour of EFT.

00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:33.192 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, tons of
craving is emotional.

00:26:33.192 --> 00:26:34.493 align:middle line:90%
It's not physical.

00:26:34.493 --> 00:26:35.661 align:middle line:90%
We think we crave the chocolate,

00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.263 align:middle line:84%
but what we really
crave is the love.

00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:39.398 align:middle line:84%
You know? So we go we
feel we miss the love

00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:40.866 align:middle line:90%
or we're board or we're lonely.

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:41.667 align:middle line:90%
We go eat the chocolate.

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:43.069 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the chocolate.

00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:44.403 align:middle line:90%
It's the love we're missing.

00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:45.471 align:middle line:90%
So

00:26:45.471 --> 00:26:46.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Sometimes
it's the chocolate.

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:48.074 align:middle line:90%
Like right now.

00:26:48.074 --> 00:26:49.175 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: [Chuckles].

00:26:49.175 --> 00:26:50.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Maybe not
getting a lot of love?

00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:53.079 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: You're getting you
want chocolate right now?

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:55.381 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'd go into it.

00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:56.949 align:middle line:90%
I could tap with you on that.

00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I could [chuckles].

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: No, it's
not a big craving.

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.253 align:middle line:84%
It's just because
I love chocolate.

00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:03.189 align:middle line:90%
So, yes, I do have those little.

00:27:03.189 --> 00:27:04.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not the chocolate.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.693 align:middle line:84%
I would have those sugar
or those wanting to eat.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:09.595 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can totally
relate to that one.

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:10.096 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yeah.

00:27:10.096 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And a lot

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.531 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So just
tap it in major.

00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:13.666 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: I'll give
you an example.

00:27:13.666 --> 00:27:15.634 align:middle line:84%
I worked with somebody
just last week and I was

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.436 align:middle line:90%
on a big group conference call.

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:22.508 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I have a
craving for this one kind

00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:25.478 align:middle line:84%
of dessert called
chocolate cream pie."

00:27:25.478 --> 00:27:27.646 align:middle line:90%
She also said, "I've worked

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.682 align:middle line:84%
on all my cravings,
all my addictions.

00:27:29.682 --> 00:27:33.319 align:middle line:84%
They've all gone away
except for this one craving

00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:35.654 align:middle line:90%
for chocolate cream pie."

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.590 align:middle line:90%
So I said to her, "Well,

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.760 align:middle line:84%
when was the last time you
wanted a chocolate cream pie?"

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I ate one tonight
before the coaching call."

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.732 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a weight
loss coaching call, okay?

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:48.467 align:middle line:84%
So there she is,
we're tapping on this.

00:27:48.467 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:90%
We're doing an EFT on this.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.404 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't figure out why

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:57.243 align:middle line:84%
in the world she had craved
this one kind of treat.

00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:58.177 align:middle line:90%
But nothing else.

00:27:58.177 --> 00:27:59.011 align:middle line:90%
She'd worked herself.

00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.979 align:middle line:90%
She's done EFT.

00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
She's done all these
other things.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.848 align:middle line:84%
Dropped all of her
other cravings except

00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.916 align:middle line:90%
for this one craving.

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:06.652 align:middle line:84%
So, we worked through
it a little bit.

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:09.155 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her to
remember events

00:28:09.155 --> 00:28:11.223 align:middle line:90%
in her life where she had pie.

00:28:11.223 --> 00:28:14.627 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well, my parents
had pie after every meal.

00:28:14.627 --> 00:28:17.196 align:middle line:90%
Our family had pie every day."

00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well,
what's one example of an event

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:25.805 align:middle line:84%
when you remember clearly
having a particular kind of pie.

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:29.508 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Well, I remember
when I was 10 or 11 years old,

00:28:29.508 --> 00:28:32.711 align:middle line:84%
we went to see my brother, who
is in a mental institution.

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:35.948 align:middle line:84%
He was retarded and it
was a really sad day

00:28:35.948 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
because this is my brother.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards we all
went out to dinner

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.824 align:middle line:84%
and had chocolate
cream pie together."

00:28:44.824 --> 00:28:46.559 align:middle line:90%
So, what they didn't do

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.795 align:middle line:84%
as a family is they
didn't discuss the fact

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:53.098 align:middle line:84%
that this little boy
was in an institution.

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.567 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't speak.

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:55.668 align:middle line:90%
She said, "I sat with him.

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:56.902 align:middle line:90%
I sat next to him.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:59.471 align:middle line:84%
I felt the connection
with him emotionally.

00:28:59.471 --> 00:29:00.539 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't speak.

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.208 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't talk to him.

00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:03.409 align:middle line:90%
So, she has all this sadness.

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:05.177 align:middle line:90%
All this really sense of loss.

00:29:05.177 --> 00:29:07.246 align:middle line:84%
Then they got to
dinner with the parents.

00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:09.615 align:middle line:84%
The parents don't
talk about the visit.

00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:11.016 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about
all the emotions

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:12.151 align:middle line:90%
that have been stirred up.

00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:13.953 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about
their feelings of grief.

00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:15.154 align:middle line:90%
That sounds retarded.

00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:20.226 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about the
sense of loss they feel.

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:22.194 align:middle line:84%
They don't help their
daughter process her feelings.

00:29:22.194 --> 00:29:27.199 align:middle line:84%
All they do is shovel pie in
their it's called your pie hole.

00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.602 align:middle line:84%
You know? You just
put pie in your mouth.

00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:34.039 align:middle line:84%
And so, all these years she's
been carrying this sense

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:35.641 align:middle line:90%
of loss and grief.

00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So we've tapped on
the loss and grief.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And her craving for chocolate
cream pie she had a wrapper

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.983 align:middle line:84%
right there with her on
the phone went down to 0.

00:29:43.983 --> 00:29:45.217 align:middle line:90%
Just dropped way down.

00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:47.853 align:middle line:84%
In fact, after EFT
[inaudible] after EFT workshops,

00:29:47.853 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:84%
we discard often, just
hundreds of candies.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.458 align:middle line:84%
People just throw
the candies away.

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:53.826 align:middle line:90%
They don't want them anymore.

00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:57.162 align:middle line:84%
They were craving them so much
before they did the tapping.

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.364 align:middle line:90%
And then they go waste.

00:29:58.364 --> 00:29:59.865 align:middle line:84%
This is an example of how
much of our suffering,

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:03.068 align:middle line:84%
much of our emotional suffering,
our cravings, our urges.

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:90%
They are not.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.571 align:middle line:84%
We think they're
physical, they're not.

00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:07.706 align:middle line:90%
Their roots are emotional.

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:09.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, it's
like they disappear.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.011 align:middle line:90%
They're released.

00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:12.811 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Yes.

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:14.013 align:middle line:90%
We have people measure them.

00:30:14.013 --> 00:30:16.348 align:middle line:84%
And so we say, "Well,
how big is your pain now?

00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:17.249 align:middle line:90%
How big is your craving?"

00:30:17.249 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
They tell us.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.488 align:middle line:84%
We measure before and
after how big it is.

00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:25.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And I had
one other question.

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I had the conversation
with Doctor Buckins.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.196 align:middle line:84%
You probably know
him back in Chicago.

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:33.799 align:middle line:90%
Buckins on EMGR?

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:36.268 align:middle line:84%
He also works with
veterans, strangely enough.

00:30:36.268 --> 00:30:39.438 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is not
I find it interesting

00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:41.674 align:middle line:84%
to meet all the different
people all

00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:44.209 align:middle line:84%
around the world having
same conversation.

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.778 align:middle line:90%
And helping and supporting and

00:30:45.778 --> 00:30:48.080 align:middle line:84%
yet using different
kinds of methodology.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.317 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a huge problem,
the veteran area aspect.

00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:52.518 align:middle line:90%
And I get that.

00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:54.887 align:middle line:84%
And yet most of us
don't have this kind

00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:55.955 align:middle line:90%
of traumatic experience,

00:30:55.955 --> 00:30:59.058 align:middle line:84%
yet we have in us
something that we carry.

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:00.826 align:middle line:84%
Like it could be
a rape, I guess.

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:02.494 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be a car accident

00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:05.831 align:middle line:84%
where we saw our brother
die in front of us.

00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:09.201 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a
divorce or whatever.

00:31:09.201 --> 00:31:12.371 align:middle line:84%
It could be tiny, but it
could affect our whole life.

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And affect so you're
saying basically,

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.743 align:middle line:84%
this is something you can
release and it has nothing

00:31:17.743 --> 00:31:19.478 align:middle line:90%
to do with your genes?

00:31:19.478 --> 00:31:20.446 align:middle line:90%
What is this gene?

00:31:20.446 --> 00:31:22.381 align:middle line:90%
Where is this genie located?

00:31:22.381 --> 00:31:26.385 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: The most severely
impacted populations we've

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.154 align:middle line:84%
worked with in our
nonprofit are people

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:84%
who are the victims
of massive disasters.

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.427 align:middle line:84%
Like, we've done several studies
in Rwanda with genocide orphans.

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:40.799 align:middle line:84%
They live through the genocide
there and they have some PTSD.

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:44.503 align:middle line:84%
We also have a team of
volunteers right now in Haiti,

00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:84%
working with people who survived
the Haiti earthquake in 2010.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.742 align:middle line:90%
So, those are extreme examples.

00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:53.112 align:middle line:84%
But, you don't have to have
been an earthquake or live

00:31:53.112 --> 00:31:59.451 align:middle line:84%
in a third world country or have
gone through a war to have PTSD.

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:03.889 align:middle line:84%
Many children in regular
families have experiences

00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:09.061 align:middle line:84%
that profoundly affect them and
that have a big emotional impact

00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:10.329 align:middle line:84%
on them for the rest
of their lives.

00:32:10.329 --> 00:32:12.731 align:middle line:84%
That might just be
mom and dad yelling.

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:84%
It it might be a
parent's absence.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.903 align:middle line:84%
They feel a sense of
abandonment by other people.

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:21.006 align:middle line:84%
And so, all their lives they're
looking to of this need filled.

00:32:21.006 --> 00:32:22.808 align:middle line:84%
They feel this, they
want to be loved.

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:24.109 align:middle line:90%
They want to find somebody.

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:25.444 align:middle line:84%
They want to find their
perfect soul mate.

00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:27.312 align:middle line:84%
They want to find
the perfect job.

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:30.049 align:middle line:90%
All these longings and cravings.

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:33.085 align:middle line:84%
And often they're laid
out in early childhood

00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.354 align:middle line:84%
because of things we lost
and didn't have back then.

00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:38.557 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the traumatic
examples that lead to PTSD,

00:32:38.557 --> 00:32:40.559 align:middle line:90%
often people have all kinds

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
of unfinished business
from their childhood.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.362 align:middle line:84%
They haven't resolved
these things.

00:32:43.362 --> 00:32:48.133 align:middle line:84%
And so, that girl who was that
little girl who had experience

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:50.936 align:middle line:84%
with her brother and now she's
craving chocolate cream pie,

00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:52.171 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:32:52.171 --> 00:32:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Because now at 45, she
feels that's her connection

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.141 align:middle line:90%
with her brother.

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:57.709 align:middle line:90%
So she's 45 now.

00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:59.545 align:middle line:84%
She's overweight
struggling with her weight.

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:00.746 align:middle line:90%
How does she deal with it?

00:33:00.746 --> 00:33:02.648 align:middle line:84%
It's all emotional based
on childhood experiences.

00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:03.849 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing how much

00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:05.851 align:middle line:84%
of our suffering is rooted
early in our childhood.

00:33:05.851 --> 00:33:09.288 align:middle line:84%
So, with these sorts of
therapies, we go in there,

00:33:09.288 --> 00:33:10.889 align:middle line:90%
like EMDR's, is a good example.

00:33:10.889 --> 00:33:14.827 align:middle line:84%
EMDR and EFT, both are
really effective for PTSD.

00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:18.697 align:middle line:84%
And we go in there and
we find those experiences

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:19.865 align:middle line:90%
and we lighten the load.

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:22.968 align:middle line:84%
We help people tap or
move through those.

00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:27.005 align:middle line:84%
And then as you shed layer after
layer after layer after layer,

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.042 align:middle line:84%
suddenly all those signals
your genes have been getting

00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:34.413 align:middle line:84%
to make adrenaline, make
cortisol, those signals go away.

00:33:34.413 --> 00:33:35.714 align:middle line:84%
And then, so you
got the signal love.

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:37.049 align:middle line:90%
Ah I'm relaxed.

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:38.183 align:middle line:90%
Life is good.

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:39.618 align:middle line:84%
There's a place for
me in the universe.

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:42.621 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to carry this
heavy emotional burden anymore.

00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:45.524 align:middle line:90%
Then, those genes that code

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.993 align:middle line:84%
for really health
promoting neurotransmitters,

00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:50.629 align:middle line:84%
like serotonin, you know,
[inaudible] a little bit

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:53.398 align:middle line:84%
of cortisol but lots
of lots of the HTA.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:55.901 align:middle line:84%
All of our health
promoting hormones are turned

00:33:55.901 --> 00:33:57.903 align:middle line:90%
on by those signals.

00:33:57.903 --> 00:33:59.705 align:middle line:90%
So as you change your mind.

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.473 align:middle line:90%
As you change your heart.

00:34:01.473 --> 00:34:05.477 align:middle line:84%
As you release that suffering,
it has deep, long lasting,

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:07.179 align:middle line:90%
profound effects on your body,

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:09.414 align:middle line:84%
as a signal is being
sent from your brain.

00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:13.051 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts, your
emotions to your body shift.

00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:16.522 align:middle line:84%
Tapping and releasing those
early childhood traumas can

00:34:16.522 --> 00:34:19.324 align:middle line:84%
dramatic effect the course
of your future health.

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:23.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: If our body wants to
it can naturally heal those?

00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> D.C: Naturally heal, yes.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:34:25.831 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:84%

>> D.C: It's been
a real pleasure.

00:34:30.035 --> 00:34:31.537 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Lilou.

00:34:31.537 --> 00:34:34.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Big, big kisses to all
[inaudible] creators out there.

00:34:34.173 --> 00:34:35.173 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.142 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have enjoyed
this interview.

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:40.445 align:middle line:84%
And the Genies in
Our Genes, right?

00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:42.046 align:middle line:84%
>> D.C: The Genie
is in Your Genes.

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:42.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Your genes.

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:44.182 align:middle line:90%
