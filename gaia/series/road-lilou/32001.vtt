>> Lilou: [Background Music]
Hello, my Juicy co-creators.

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.318 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road interviewing
amazing co-creators all

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
around the world and today
I'm sitting here in London,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
in England with your
Arielle, hello.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.994 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Essex: Hello,
lovely to see you and meet you.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:31.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And I love it when
London and England is sunny.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.867 align:middle line:90%
It's even more wonderful.

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.103 align:middle line:84%
It's such a wonderful experience
and very different than usual.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:36.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Arielle Essex: Well yes.

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:39.106 align:middle line:90%
I live here for 35 years now

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:42.476 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you the summers
aren't usually as nice as this.

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Where you
from originally?

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:44.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Arielle Essex: New York.

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:45.813 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Fantastic.

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:48.716 align:middle line:84%
So we have a New York, an
American here in London

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:51.685 align:middle line:84%
and I love it because-- and
there's these cultures--

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:55.089 align:middle line:84%
blend of cultures, that makes
it really, really interesting.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.793 align:middle line:84%
So you have this amazing story
and I'm very happy to do this,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.129 align:middle line:84%
this interview with you
and we'll going to deal

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
about also crisis advice
because you face a huge crisis

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.568 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.637 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak
of health of course.

00:01:09.637 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And you are the author
of a book published

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.509 align:middle line:84%
by Hay House called
Practical Miracles.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.777 align:middle line:84%
So we're here to
speak about miracles.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.179 align:middle line:90%
We love speaking about miracles.

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.213 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:20.281 align:middle line:90%
My favorite topic,

00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.483 align:middle line:84%
I feel there's miracles
happening everyday

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:24.385 align:middle line:90%
and we're not just aware of it.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:26.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Essex: Every moment,
every moment, yes, why not?

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Essex: We
just don't recognize them

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.359 align:middle line:84%
and it's learning how to
recognize them, that is the art,

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.864 align:middle line:84%
the real art of everything,
appealing, of success,

00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.867 align:middle line:84%
of relationships if we
can recognize the miracle

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.604 align:middle line:84%
in every moment or the potential
for a miracle in every moment.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.806 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you
define miracle then?

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:47.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Arielle Essex: That's
a very good question.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:84%
In fact a good place to start
because I think particularly

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.079 align:middle line:84%
in the health field,
people think of a miracle

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.951 align:middle line:84%
as an instant healing like
somebody goes abracadabra

00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly boom,
you're healed.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.923 align:middle line:84%
And I know that from my
own experience, my clients

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
and even myself, when I go in to
have a treatment of some kind,

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
if I don't come out
feeling instantly better,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.097 align:middle line:90%
I'm disappointed.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping for that
instant miracle.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You start comparing
with other experiences?

00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:16.036 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Absolutely.

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.538 align:middle line:90%
And will say this person,

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.007 align:middle line:84%
this treatment was
good, that one wasn't.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.111 align:middle line:84%
When in fact what I discovered
is that almost every type

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:29.016 align:middle line:84%
of treatment is useful and
has helped somebody somewhere.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.286 align:middle line:84%
So I have a much broader
and more flexible view

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:34.421 align:middle line:84%
of different kinds
of treatments.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:35.623 align:middle line:90%
But going back--

00:02:35.623 --> 00:02:37.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're speaking
of holistic treatment

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:39.193 align:middle line:90%
and not-- energetic as well.

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:41.228 align:middle line:90%
Not just the traditional way.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.397 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Everything, everything.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:47.434 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm a
naturopath by background

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:84%
so I prefer looking at
the body more naturally.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:84%
But it's the natural
miracles that I want to sort

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.844 align:middle line:90%
of encourage to happen.

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:58.646 align:middle line:84%
Now my definition
of a miracle comes

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:01.949 align:middle line:84%
from the metaphysical
book, A Course in Miracles,

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.552 align:middle line:84%
and in that book, it defines a
miracle as a change in thought.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.422 align:middle line:84%
And I say before a
miracle can happen,

00:03:08.422 --> 00:03:11.759 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a change
in your perspective.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
You have to be able to think

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.628 align:middle line:84%
about the situation
in a different way.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.964 align:middle line:90%
And I said what does that mean?

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.165 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.868 align:middle line:84%
Now I've always been in
the opinion that mind,

00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:23.637 align:middle line:84%
body medicine is
really where it's at.

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:25.306 align:middle line:90%
If we can change our thoughts

00:03:25.306 --> 00:03:30.678 align:middle line:84%
and reduce our stress then
the body has a chance to heal.

00:03:30.678 --> 00:03:32.579 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know whether
you had the good fortune

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.083 align:middle line:84%
to meet Dr. Bruce Lipton yet
but he's one of my heroes

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:40.086 align:middle line:84%
and you know, he says up to 95
percent of illness is caused

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.524 align:middle line:84%
by stress and that's
mental emotional stress.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:47.294 align:middle line:84%
That's can only be caused by
our thinking, bad thinking.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:49.263 align:middle line:84%
So, if we could change
our bad thinking,

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:53.767 align:middle line:84%
our mistake in thinking
into miracles mindedness,

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:55.936 align:middle line:84%
then we have greater
potential to heal.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:57.504 align:middle line:90%
That's where I'm coming from.

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is that how you were
able to cure your brain tumor?

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:04.545 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about this
diagnosis that you received

00:04:04.545 --> 00:04:07.748 align:middle line:84%
and what was kind of the
circumstances of it too?

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:08.982 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Sure.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:12.653 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like an old story
and it's unusual story.

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.621 align:middle line:84%
It's an old story because
it happened 20 years ago.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, the
other life huh?

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.358 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Yeah.

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:19.425 align:middle line:84%
And I've been healed
for over 10 years now.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:84%
So actually 13 years I've
been completely healed.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.767 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was what
happens to many people.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.036 align:middle line:84%
I got diagnosed with
what sounded

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:32.039 align:middle line:84%
like a very serious
illness out of the blue,

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:90%
completely out of the blue.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.943 align:middle line:84%
Now to put into perspective,
I was working

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.644 align:middle line:90%
as an osteopath and naturopath.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:38.812 align:middle line:90%
I had a perfect diet.

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:40.047 align:middle line:90%
I was exercising.

00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:90%
I was meditating.

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.283 align:middle line:84%
I was on a spiritual
path for 20 years.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.787 align:middle line:84%
I was doing everything
in "right."

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:48.622 align:middle line:90%
And so to suddenly be diagnosed

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.158 align:middle line:84%
with a brain tumor
was a shocked.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:53.093 align:middle line:90%
And I thought well, "Why me?

00:04:53.093 --> 00:04:54.728 align:middle line:84%
How come, you know, all
of these other people

00:04:54.728 --> 00:04:55.596 align:middle line:90%
who were doing, you know?"

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's so unfair.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.998 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: So unfair, you know?

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:03.203 align:middle line:84%
And overnight I-- I had to
recognize that all of the things

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:06.173 align:middle line:84%
that I was thinking now had
to be put into practice.

00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:09.109 align:middle line:84%
So of course I took the mind,
body approach at first and said,

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.178 align:middle line:84%
"Right, I'm going to
heal this naturally.

00:05:11.178 --> 00:05:13.781 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do everything I
can to heal this naturally.

00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.116 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have
the orthodox treatment."

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.651 align:middle line:90%
And it was so stressful.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:19.052 align:middle line:90%
I still went to the doctor.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.288 align:middle line:84%
I still have the
scans, the blood test,

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:25.092 align:middle line:84%
the visits to the surgeons and I
had-- I took all of their advice

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:27.094 align:middle line:84%
and of course they were
promoting, you know,

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:30.731 align:middle line:84%
I should take certain drugs
and I looked into surgery

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
at one point and there's
just like, oh my goodness.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.068 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't want to do
want to do any of this.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:36.637 align:middle line:84%
That lasted for about
six months.

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:39.473 align:middle line:84%
And after about six
months, I was so fed

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:41.642 align:middle line:84%
up with what I began
to call my nightmare.

00:05:41.642 --> 00:05:45.579 align:middle line:84%
It was like this black cloud
used to descent on my head.

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.648 align:middle line:84%
And every morning
I would say, "Oh,

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I got to carry this
brain tumor around."

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.954 align:middle line:84%
What was curios was, before I
was diagnosed I had headaches

00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:56.056 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have any other
symptoms that I was aware of.

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:58.425 align:middle line:90%
My life was normal.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had this trauma
to deal with.

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So, at six months
I thought, well,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.565 align:middle line:84%
maybe I should just get
rid of it 'cause, you know,

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:05.999 align:middle line:84%
I want one of those
instant miracles.

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I go to the surgeon, have the
operation and get rid of it.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.806 align:middle line:84%
And that meant I had to, you
know, really face my fear

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.309 align:middle line:84%
of surgery and all the things
that people have to face

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.744 align:middle line:84%
when they're build for
chemotherapy or radiotherapy

00:06:17.744 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:84%
or surgery or any of those
really invasive techniques,

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:26.587 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "Okay, so I had to
use all of my skills to sort

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of calm myself down, to go
to visit the neurosurgeon."

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.859 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, I finally
went into his office

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.861 align:middle line:84%
and we put he put all my scans
on the wall and he looked

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
at them and he said, "Your
tumor is located right behind

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.298 align:middle line:90%
this bone.

00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:41.468 align:middle line:84%
I had to drill through the
bone to get at the tumor.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:43.804 align:middle line:90%
So this is far too dangerous.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:48.175 align:middle line:84%
Your tumor, you know, is
large but it's not dangerous."

00:06:48.175 --> 00:06:49.642 align:middle line:90%
So I refuse.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to operate unless
it doubles in size and comes

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.915 align:middle line:84%
over that bone and I can
get at it more easily.

00:06:54.915 --> 00:06:57.651 align:middle line:84%
So you know I knew at that
point, I could have gone

00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to a different surgeon
who would have operated.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I could have taken the drug
but instead I walked out of

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.893 align:middle line:84%
that office with a great
big smile on my face.

00:07:05.893 --> 00:07:08.362 align:middle line:90%
I was so relieved.

00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.297 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
have to have surgery.

00:07:10.297 --> 00:07:12.232 align:middle line:84%
I was-- he encouraged
me to take the drug

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:14.835 align:middle line:84%
but I'd already decided not to
take the drug they offered me

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:17.804 align:middle line:84%
because it had really
lousy side effects.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:20.207 align:middle line:84%
And my symptoms weren't
that bad.

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:24.211 align:middle line:84%
And when I researched what the
drug actually did for the tumor,

00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:84%
it didn't heal it,
it didn't cure it.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.018 align:middle line:84%
It sort of shrank it in
a short of dehydrated way

00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:90%
but the cells kept multiplying.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Now at that point in time I
really wanted to have a baby.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And what were the
consequences of that tumor too?

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean it is-- was
it going to grow,

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.798 align:middle line:90%
could it be actually deadly?

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.233 align:middle line:90%
What was the impact?

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:48.535 align:middle line:84%
Was it just there
for now and kind

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:50.938 align:middle line:84%
of they didn't really
know how it would evolve?

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:52.139 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: That's right
they didn't know.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:54.508 align:middle line:84%
It was-- what they
called borderline.

00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:55.976 align:middle line:90%
It was right in the pituitary.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It was called a prolactinoma
and it was 1 centimeter

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:90%
which is their point

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:05.118 align:middle line:84%
where beyond 1 centimeter
is definitely malignant.

00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.854 align:middle line:84%
Under 1 centimeter,
it's benign usually.

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Mine was right at 1
centimeter so they didn't know

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.592 align:middle line:90%
which way it was going except

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:14.261 align:middle line:84%
that the blood test
measuring the amount

00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:19.533 align:middle line:84%
of prolactin being
produced were extremely high

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.702 align:middle line:84%
and that meant it was
very, very active.

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:25.038 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was 2200

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.442 align:middle line:84%
or 22,000 I can't remember
the exact amount of--

00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:32.112 align:middle line:84%
excuse, of prolactin
being produced.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:36.883 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I thought
to myself when I left

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:39.686 align:middle line:84%
that surgeon's office, I'm
not going to take the drug

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle line:90%
because it has side effects.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:45.592 align:middle line:84%
The tumor is causing infertility
that's one of the side effects.

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:47.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you were 39 and
you wanted to have a baby yeah?

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:51.064 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Yeah, I was 39, the
magic age of the clock-ticking

00:08:51.064 --> 00:08:53.033 align:middle line:84%
and I have this wonderful
boyfriend

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:57.204 align:middle line:84%
and he really wanted a boy-- he
really wanted a baby, so did I.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:00.841 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we even got
pregnant for two weeks once,

00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:03.944 align:middle line:84%
that was a long time ago
and I loss it unfortunately,

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:06.179 align:middle line:84%
probably because of
the high prolactin.

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.181 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a
high level of prolactin

00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:90%
in your blood stream, it's

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.986 align:middle line:84%
like your body is being told
you're already pregnant.

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.589 align:middle line:84%
Prolactin is the hormone
that makes milk, get produced

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:19.293 align:middle line:84%
in the breast and
for babies obviously,

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:21.561 align:middle line:90%
and I had such a high level

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.197 align:middle line:84%
that my body thought it
was already pregnant.

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:25.465 align:middle line:90%
You know what's interesting.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:28.735 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be pregnant so
much and had been thinking

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.203 align:middle line:90%
about babies for so long.

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:32.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But you already
turned on the mode, pregnant.

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Exactly.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.675 align:middle line:84%
My body said, "Oh, you
want to be pregnant?

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:35.809 align:middle line:90%
Be pregnant then."

00:09:35.809 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And this is
linked to the tumor then?

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.881 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Possibly, who knows?

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.917 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts that actually
I needed to change were

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
around the whole issue
of being a mother

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.955 align:middle line:90%
and being in relationship.

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.825 align:middle line:84%
It was very much about
those sorts of issues.

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about your
previous relationship?

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.097 align:middle line:84%
It is-- was really something
there for you as struggle

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:84%
that led to that or how, what
was the relationship world?

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:04.071 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Well my relationship
world has always been my

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.539 align:middle line:90%
biggest challenge.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.808 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not
uncommon these days, you know,

00:10:07.808 --> 00:10:10.677 align:middle line:84%
I have many friends who
are equally challenged

00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
by having a really
good relationship.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.382 align:middle line:84%
And up to that time,
well, I've been married

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.784 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years, I gotten divorce.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.087 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would take
me a maximum of two years

00:10:20.087 --> 00:10:23.323 align:middle line:84%
to find myself, a husband
who really wanted children.

00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:25.092 align:middle line:84%
My ex-husband didn't
want children.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:28.695 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I find a man who
really wants to be a father.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:31.365 align:middle line:84%
I'll move to the house--
through a house in the country

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:34.568 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have, you know, kids
and a dog and a cat and a horse,

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.503 align:middle line:84%
you know, and everything
will be beautiful

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:37.971 align:middle line:90%
and I have this perfect life.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.941 align:middle line:84%
Well that was my plan
anyway and I thought

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:42.542 align:middle line:84%
that was my best
plan for happiness.

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:46.046 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was I had
relationship after relationship

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:47.948 align:middle line:90%
which floundered and failed

00:10:47.948 --> 00:10:51.218 align:middle line:84%
and left me feeling quite
battered and bruised.

00:10:51.218 --> 00:10:54.287 align:middle line:84%
And then I met this
lovely man when I was 39

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.523 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted children
and everything looked

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:58.225 align:middle line:90%
like it was promising.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:00.827 align:middle line:84%
And he was-- he was an
absolute angel to me.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.395 align:middle line:90%
He was so supportive.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, "Brain tumor?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.365 align:middle line:90%
Huh! It doesn't matter."

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.633 align:middle line:84%
You know and his
attitude of "Huh!

00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:09.069 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,"
didn't change anything.

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:90%
That really helped me.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So that was very supportive and
I was very grateful for that.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.843 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that relationship
didn't last more than a couple

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:21.815 align:middle line:84%
of years so that too sort of
left me in the same problem area

00:11:21.815 --> 00:11:24.117 align:middle line:90%
for quite a lot longer.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I obviously had a lot
of learning to do.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.523 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry I forgot to tell.

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:33.727 align:middle line:84%
The tumor wasn't
life threatening.

00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:37.364 align:middle line:84%
Being in the pituitary,
it could become malignant.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.767 align:middle line:84%
It could spread to other
cells but it's unlikely.

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:84%
What they did say was that
there was a great danger

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:48.275 align:middle line:84%
that if it grew I could go blind
and I didn't quite like that.

00:11:48.275 --> 00:11:53.547 align:middle line:84%
The main symptom I had was just
earth-shattering headaches.

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:57.083 align:middle line:90%
Five days of incredible pain.

00:11:57.083 --> 00:12:00.654 align:middle line:84%
And those would happen at the
drop of a hat, usually a minimum

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:03.723 align:middle line:84%
of once a month,
sometimes more often.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:06.893 align:middle line:84%
And a curious thing happens
which I noticed happens to a lot

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of people when they have
a symptom of that pain or,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.599 align:middle line:84%
you know, of they're--
they're undergoing treatment

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:16.603 align:middle line:84%
for something and they're just
suffering is that the body goes

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:20.507 align:middle line:84%
into stress and when the body
goes into stress all the sort

00:12:20.507 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
of energy that goes to
the back part of the brain

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.846 align:middle line:84%
which is the fight,
flight stress response part

00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:28.915 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, the
reactive part of the brain.

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:30.951 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
all the juice,

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:32.285 align:middle line:90%
all the energy is taken away

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:35.422 align:middle line:84%
from your frontier lobes
so you can't think.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:39.192 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed was I
would have total amnesia.

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.661 align:middle line:84%
Imagine I've been
suffering these headaches

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.263 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I was trained as a cranial
osteopath, I knew naturopathy,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.669 align:middle line:84%
I knew all of kinds of healing
techniques from kinesiology.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:52.038 align:middle line:84%
I had been able to
heal my headaches again

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.573 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:12:53.573 --> 00:12:59.012 align:middle line:84%
Every time a new one started I
would forget what worked before.

00:12:59.012 --> 00:13:00.247 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that funny?

00:13:00.247 --> 00:13:02.749 align:middle line:84%
It was like I-- I thought
I must leave a trail

00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:06.453 align:middle line:84%
of breadcrumbs next time because
I can never remember what to do

00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:08.255 align:middle line:90%
to get myself out to this.

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:11.524 align:middle line:84%
And instead I would
always do the wrong thing

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:14.628 align:middle line:84%
because what I've be tempted to
do is, oh, the pain is so great,

00:13:14.628 --> 00:13:16.062 align:middle line:90%
I just want to lie down.

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:16.897 align:middle line:90%
I just want to lie down.

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:18.465 align:middle line:90%
I got to go back to bed.

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.333 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just want to
put a cold compress

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:21.835 align:middle line:90%
on my head and lie down.

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:24.271 align:middle line:84%
But that was always
what made it worse.

00:13:24.271 --> 00:13:26.806 align:middle line:84%
But I would never remember
that at the beginning.

00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd only think of what I
thought would relieve it.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.713 align:middle line:84%
Actually what made it
best was a real clue.

00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:37.784 align:middle line:84%
If I continue to work, if
I continue to see clients,

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and especially if I'm just
doing gentle cranial work

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.956 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the healing
energy to flow through me,

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.292 align:middle line:90%
i felt so much better.

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.827 align:middle line:84%
And what was even
more curious was

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.664 align:middle line:84%
that my clients never
noticed that I was in pain

00:13:50.664 --> 00:13:53.199 align:middle line:84%
and I've never-- never
ever told them of course.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:57.003 align:middle line:84%
So I used to laugh to myself
after they left thinking

00:13:57.003 --> 00:13:58.204 align:middle line:90%
if they only knew, you know?

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They came in with sort
of a 10 percent pain

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.909 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting there
with a 90 percent pain

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:06.346 align:middle line:84%
if they only knew, but, you
know, it wasn't important.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle line:84%
What was important for me
was that I helped them heal,

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:11.751 align:middle line:90%
I got the healing too.

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:14.387 align:middle line:84%
Now that was a clue that
something was happening

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:15.455 align:middle line:90%
on a mental, emotional,

00:14:15.455 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:84%
and energetic level
that was helping me.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.028 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my
issue had to do

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
with this whole relationship
issue because I read bodies

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.437 align:middle line:84%
and I read symptoms and I knew
that there was no accident,

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
there was no coincidence
that I got a prolactinoma.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, it didn't come from
outer space and go wiz, wiz,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.413 align:middle line:84%
wiz into my head and it's a--
it's a complete coincidence.

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.414 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in that.

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought I had to
have created this.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.085 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I've been obsessed

00:14:45.085 --> 00:14:47.988 align:middle line:84%
with having a great
relationship, happy family

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:50.957 align:middle line:90%
and a baby, I've been obsessed.

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:53.393 align:middle line:84%
And-- And obsession
is like, you know,

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:56.429 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking thoughts all
the time about something.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:90%
And if you think about it,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
cancer is an obsessive
growth of cells.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.704 align:middle line:84%
It's mirroring your obsessive
thoughts structure in a way

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:07.574 align:middle line:84%
so in some way, shape, or
perform, I was creating this

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.743 align:middle line:90%
with my own obsessive thinking.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.579 align:middle line:84%
So I went for help in
terms of learning about how

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.382 align:middle line:84%
to have a good relationship
and I went

00:15:15.382 --> 00:15:19.352 align:middle line:84%
on every single relationship
training I could get my

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:21.054 align:middle line:90%
hands on.

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:24.324 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: John Gray, I had the
privilege to interview too.

00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:27.694 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: John Gray and his
ex-wife, what was her name, Pia.

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:31.331 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Harville
Hendrix you probably know?

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:36.102 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Yes, Harville Hendrix
and Sondra Ray and I ended

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:40.073 align:middle line:84%
up training extensively with
Chuck and Lency Spezzano

00:15:40.073 --> 00:15:43.877 align:middle line:84%
who specialized in
relationships.

00:15:43.877 --> 00:15:46.079 align:middle line:84%
So I spent 10 years
training with them

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:47.914 align:middle line:84%
to learn what I was
doing wrong and how

00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:51.117 align:middle line:84%
to identify the thoughts
and beliefs.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:55.055 align:middle line:84%
I was also training in NLP
and that kind of happened

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:58.558 align:middle line:84%
by accident but it was the
best thing that I ever did.

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.693 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, because
NLP helps you

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.396 align:middle line:90%
to notice what you're thinking.

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's really a
training and becoming aware,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.936 align:middle line:84%
aware of your own
thoughts, your own beliefs.

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:13.139 align:middle line:84%
You know it's like being able
to stop your mind like a movie

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.341 align:middle line:84%
and run it backwards
and replay it,

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.744 align:middle line:84%
and run it backwards
and replay it.

00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:19.079 align:middle line:84%
And so that you can
actually think,

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:21.448 align:middle line:84%
"Oh what was I thinking just
before that and just before

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:22.782 align:middle line:90%
that and just before that?

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.585 align:middle line:84%
How did I get to this depressed
state or this angry state

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
or this fearful state?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.956 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah I was running that movie
and then I saw that billboard

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.991 align:middle line:84%
and then somebody, you
know, screwed their face

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.395 align:middle line:84%
up on the bus and-- and then
I felt that look just like my,

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:40.166 align:middle line:84%
you know, my sister or whatever
and then I would have a thought.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.602 align:middle line:84%
I would have a whole
string of thoughts

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:43.937 align:middle line:84%
which would leave
me down a path.

00:16:43.937 --> 00:16:47.207 align:middle line:84%
Now if I hadn't learn how to
stop the movie and rewind it

00:16:47.207 --> 00:16:50.009 align:middle line:84%
and run it backwards to find a
thoughts would have been harder

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.778 align:middle line:90%
to do that because a lot

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:53.947 align:middle line:84%
of times you're not
aware of your thinking.

00:16:53.947 --> 00:16:57.617 align:middle line:84%
We're just aware of, you know,
we're going around our life,

00:16:57.617 --> 00:17:00.386 align:middle line:84%
you know, doing what we're doing
maybe we're having a feeling,

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:02.655 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we're thinking
what we're going do next

00:17:02.655 --> 00:17:05.023 align:middle line:84%
and that's all of
our conscious mind

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:06.693 align:middle line:84%
and I was smart enough
to know it.

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't my conscious mind
that it created this tumor.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Bruce Lipton, he
said, you enjoy Bruce Lipton,

00:17:12.966 --> 00:17:16.002 align:middle line:84%
he speaks a lot being
conscious, all in conscious.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Absolutely.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And that runs the
show that sort of thing.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.841 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: It does, and nobody gets
up in the morning and says,

00:17:21.841 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle line:84%
today is a good day
to have a cold

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.245 align:middle line:90%
or let's create cancer today,

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.148 align:middle line:84%
or let's have some
other nasty disease,

00:17:28.148 --> 00:17:30.717 align:middle line:84%
or let's create a crisis
in our life, you know,

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
we don't do that,
not consciously.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.956 align:middle line:84%
So I began to get very, very
curious about what was going

00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:39.159 align:middle line:90%
on in my unconscious mind.

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:42.695 align:middle line:84%
And NLP is a training
also based on hypnosis.

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:45.665 align:middle line:84%
So delve into the
unconscious in ways

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:48.034 align:middle line:84%
that make it less
frightening and threatening.

00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:50.837 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's very-- it's like
conscious way of looking

00:17:50.837 --> 00:17:53.606 align:middle line:84%
at the unconscious if
that makes any sense,

00:17:53.606 --> 00:17:56.342 align:middle line:84%
and they both use
the same brain cells.

00:17:56.342 --> 00:17:57.844 align:middle line:90%
The unconscious is always there.

00:17:57.844 --> 00:17:58.811 align:middle line:90%
It's always listening.

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.947 align:middle line:84%
It's always putting
its little input

00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:03.249 align:middle line:84%
in if you know how
to listen to it.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:06.052 align:middle line:84%
And my personal view is
that our body is like a--

00:18:06.052 --> 00:18:09.489 align:middle line:84%
a print out of the
unconscious mind.

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.791 align:middle line:84%
I think that, you know,
every thought we think

00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:15.762 align:middle line:84%
and every feeling we feel
gets stored in the body.

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:19.532 align:middle line:84%
And as a body worker, you
know, have had this experience

00:18:19.532 --> 00:18:22.602 align:middle line:84%
of when you are touching
somebody else's body, massaging

00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
or doing some kind of treatment,
you might stimulate a memory

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.943 align:middle line:90%
to come up out of the blue

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.978 align:middle line:84%
and they would have been
absolutely perfectly

00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:34.781 align:middle line:84%
in their consciousness mind
totally OK in one moment

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:38.084 align:middle line:84%
and you touch their knee or
their shoulder or wherever,

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:40.253 align:middle line:84%
you know, the memory
had been stored

00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:43.056 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly the whole
memory comes flooding back.

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:44.958 align:middle line:84%
And I had that happen
with several clients

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.462 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that's really
interesting, very interesting.

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:51.497 align:middle line:84%
And after it comes
up to the surface

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:84%
of course all the feelings
flood in as well and that's

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:58.738 align:middle line:84%
so precious because then
you can deal with it,

00:18:58.738 --> 00:19:01.074 align:middle line:90%
then you know what to work on.

00:19:01.074 --> 00:19:03.443 align:middle line:84%
What was hard for me
was the tumor was right

00:19:03.443 --> 00:19:04.611 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of my head.

00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't touch it,
I couldn't get at it.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.316 align:middle line:84%
I could only into it
what it was about.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.486 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't that
many people working

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:18.224 align:middle line:84%
in this field I read all the
books I could get my hands on.

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:19.759 align:middle line:90%
Deepak Chopra had just come

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.128 align:middle line:84%
out with his first book
Quantum Healing about then

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and that was like my bible.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.267 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, oh somebody is
really speaking my language.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.236 align:middle line:84%
And luckily he went on
to write many other books

00:19:30.236 --> 00:19:32.105 align:middle line:84%
and I've read them
all and that was--

00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:35.408 align:middle line:84%
that was helpful because I was
beginning to feel that my way

00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:38.945 align:middle line:84%
of thinking about health
and healing was verified.

00:19:38.945 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%
But it was a long slow process.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.516 align:middle line:84%
And instead of having one
of these miracles cures

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.819 align:middle line:84%
in four days or two
weeks or a few months.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:50.089 align:middle line:84%
You know my process
was very long and slow

00:19:50.089 --> 00:19:52.458 align:middle line:84%
and that's why I said my
stories kind of an odd one.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:53.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That's
refreshing to hear that.

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.763 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: And that's when
I began to realize

00:19:56.763 --> 00:19:58.998 align:middle line:84%
because when I start giving
talks about, you know,

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:01.567 align:middle line:84%
what I've gone through,
people would come up to me

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:05.505 align:middle line:84%
after the talk and say, "Oh
thank you for saying Arielle

00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:07.607 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
feeling such a failure

00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.109 align:middle line:84%
for not having a
spontaneous remission.

00:20:10.109 --> 00:20:12.145 align:middle line:84%
For not having healed
in two weeks

00:20:12.145 --> 00:20:14.681 align:middle line:90%
or in three months or whatever.

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:16.983 align:middle line:84%
I've been, you know, working
on my problem for years

00:20:16.983 --> 00:20:18.584 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still got it."

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:21.788 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Oh I know that, I
know that feeling because I had

00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to deal with those
feelings of failure."

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.992 align:middle line:84%
When I read all this
fabulous stories

00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:28.294 align:middle line:84%
about people having
this miracle healings,

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:30.096 align:middle line:90%
I was going, "Why not me?

00:20:30.096 --> 00:20:31.497 align:middle line:90%
Why not me?"

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:32.965 align:middle line:84%
'Cause remember I was the one
who is doing everything right.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking, I deserve one,

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:37.437 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing holding
me back, except myself.

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:90%
It was me holding me back.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.011 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the sort of
funny side of it was I began

00:20:45.011 --> 00:20:49.482 align:middle line:84%
to get better and better at
identifying all the beliefs

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:51.951 align:middle line:90%
and each one was important.

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:90%
And it was like I had to go

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.257 align:middle line:84%
through a long slow
university education in learning

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:01.327 align:middle line:84%
about what was inside
my own head.

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:04.163 align:middle line:84%
And for me that was
really valuable

00:21:04.163 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
because what it gave
was an insider's view

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.236 align:middle line:90%
of what goes on in the mind.

00:21:10.236 --> 00:21:13.673 align:middle line:84%
So then now when I'm with the
client, I have no surprises

00:21:13.673 --> 00:21:15.842 align:middle line:84%
because I think, "Oh yeah
that makes total sense to me,

00:21:15.842 --> 00:21:18.511 align:middle line:84%
I can see how that person would
have gone from that thought

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:20.046 align:middle line:90%
to that though to that thought."

00:21:20.046 --> 00:21:23.483 align:middle line:84%
Or they can tell me the final
place and I can into it,

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:25.952 align:middle line:84%
lots of the thoughts that
must have come before that

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:28.921 align:middle line:84%
and asked just the right
question as to, OK,

00:21:28.921 --> 00:21:31.891 align:middle line:84%
so did that ever happen or
did you ever have this thought

00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:34.527 align:middle line:90%
and save them all that time.

00:21:34.527 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But no one was there
for me to do that,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.298 align:middle line:84%
I had to do it in
a long slow way.

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:40.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But were
you seeing progression

00:21:40.867 --> 00:21:43.636 align:middle line:84%
because that can be frustrating
too when as you said,

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.571 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
healing that we received

00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:49.809 align:middle line:84%
but there's no manifestation
of potential remission

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.311 align:middle line:84%
or whatsoever in
our daily lives.

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.614 align:middle line:90%
So how do you deal with that?

00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:57.016 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Well luckily I
was having regular scans

00:21:57.016 --> 00:21:58.885 align:middle line:90%
and regular blood test.

00:21:58.885 --> 00:22:02.288 align:middle line:84%
And I had a wonderful doctor
who was very open-minded

00:22:02.288 --> 00:22:05.324 align:middle line:84%
and flexible, you
know, he encouraged me

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:07.894 align:middle line:84%
to take the drug
every time I saw him.

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:10.997 align:middle line:84%
But when he saw that
after a year or so,

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:13.499 align:middle line:84%
my prolactin level
started to come down.

00:22:13.499 --> 00:22:16.369 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was 22 hundred
or something and then it came

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:19.472 align:middle line:84%
down to about a thousand
something, and then he came

00:22:19.472 --> 00:22:25.278 align:middle line:84%
down to about 800 and then
it got stock at about 723.

00:22:25.278 --> 00:22:28.314 align:middle line:84%
But that was only about,
you know, a few hundred

00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:31.417 align:middle line:84%
above the maximum level
that it should be at.

00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:37.423 align:middle line:84%
So that gave that gave him
confidence that I was OK

00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:40.793 align:middle line:84%
and it gave me verification
that I was on the right track,

00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:90%
and that was terribly important.

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.498 align:middle line:84%
It was also very important
for me to have his back

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:84%
up because I felt I had
a safety net, you know,

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
here was this specialist, you
know, he was an endocrinologist.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: In London?

00:22:52.438 --> 00:22:54.841 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Yes, an endocrinologist,
a specialist and a skilled.

00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:57.643 align:middle line:84%
He was also was an obstetrician
which is interesting

00:22:57.643 --> 00:22:58.711 align:middle line:90%
that I was working with a man

00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.848 align:middle line:84%
who help women have
babies, very funny.

00:23:01.848 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But he was a lovely,
lovely doctor.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:09.021 align:middle line:84%
He was a doctor who--
he gave from his heart.

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:12.658 align:middle line:84%
His love shown out of his eyes,
it's the best way to say it.

00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:16.596 align:middle line:84%
His eyes sparkled and the
moment I met him I thought yes,

00:23:16.596 --> 00:23:20.733 align:middle line:84%
I can work with this doctor and
I so fortunate that, you know,

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.969 align:middle line:84%
I was able to work
with him for 10 years.

00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The connection
is so important,

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.073 align:middle line:84%
the person that we choose to
be surrounded by especially

00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:31.077 align:middle line:84%
in those healing moments that
makes that that's probably one

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:33.779 align:middle line:84%
of the most important things
to have that connection

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.214 align:middle line:90%
and have that feeling.

00:23:35.214 --> 00:23:36.616 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Yeah.

00:23:36.616 --> 00:23:40.653 align:middle line:84%
So when he saw that my prolactin
went down, you know, he was--

00:23:40.653 --> 00:23:42.522 align:middle line:90%
he is sort of we made a deal

00:23:42.522 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
because he kept encouraging
me to have the drug.

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:49.195 align:middle line:84%
And I keep saying, I would
bring in the up-to-date journals

00:23:49.195 --> 00:23:52.632 align:middle line:84%
of the drug and its effect
on the tumor that I've gotten

00:23:52.632 --> 00:23:54.433 align:middle line:84%
out at the medical
libraries and of course

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.135 align:middle line:84%
with doctors they
don't have time to keep

00:23:56.135 --> 00:23:57.436 align:middle line:90%
up with their own journals.

00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:00.106 align:middle line:84%
But it was my interest so
I went out and got those.

00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.642 align:middle line:84%
And I had to say, well I just
read this article and I give it

00:24:02.642 --> 00:24:04.544 align:middle line:84%
to him and it says here,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:24:04.544 --> 00:24:07.213 align:middle line:84%
I said I don't think I
want to take this drug.

00:24:07.213 --> 00:24:10.683 align:middle line:84%
And he would smile and he would
say, OK, I know people like you.

00:24:10.683 --> 00:24:11.884 align:middle line:90%
We'll make a deal.

00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:13.519 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write you a
prescription for the drug

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:15.655 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
carry it in your wallet.

00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:17.723 align:middle line:90%
And if your symptoms get worse,

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:19.725 align:middle line:84%
you'll get it filled
and take the drug.

00:24:19.725 --> 00:24:22.595 align:middle line:84%
If you stay stable, you can
continue doing what you're

00:24:22.595 --> 00:24:23.963 align:middle line:90%
doing, I said deal.

00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:26.933 align:middle line:84%
Of course he would conveniently
forget this deal every time,

00:24:26.933 --> 00:24:30.503 align:middle line:84%
I'd come back so I'd
have to gently remind him

00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:32.538 align:middle line:90%
but we have this deal.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.274 align:middle line:84%
And gradually he began to
say that I was taking a lot

00:24:35.274 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:90%
of responsibility probably more

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.378 align:middle line:84%
than most people
would have done.

00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:84%
You know of course I
was frightened at times.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
You know when the pain was
really great and sometimes

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.553 align:middle line:84%
when I didn't get an immediate,
you know, complete cure,

00:24:47.553 --> 00:24:49.755 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, well,
maybe I'm wasting my time,

00:24:49.755 --> 00:24:51.591 align:middle line:90%
but I had no alternative.

00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:53.426 align:middle line:84%
Remember I couldn't
take the surgery.

00:24:53.426 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%
I knew too much about the drug.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.063 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any other options.

00:24:57.063 --> 00:24:59.498 align:middle line:84%
So instead I went out
and I tried everything.

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.934 align:middle line:84%
I tried all kinds
of unusual forms

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
of healing, psychic healing.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.439 align:middle line:90%
I went to all kinds of--

00:25:06.439 --> 00:25:10.543 align:middle line:84%
I went to electro crystal
therapy and I did homeopathy.

00:25:10.543 --> 00:25:13.646 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathy was very helpful to
me and I continue to do that.

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:16.148 align:middle line:90%
Lots of craniosacral.

00:25:16.148 --> 00:25:17.583 align:middle line:90%
I had all this--

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:19.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So retrieval
shamanism?

00:25:19.318 --> 00:25:20.353 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Yes, yes.

00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:23.055 align:middle line:84%
And I did tons of
re-birthing and I--

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:24.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Past life regression?

00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:27.293 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Lots of past
life regressions.

00:25:27.293 --> 00:25:28.761 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness I
had so much fun.

00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:30.463 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:35.601 align:middle line:84%
And I learned so much that my
whole work began to change.

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So I went from being
an osteopath

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and a cranial osteopath to
gradually incorporating more NLP

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and more of the past
life regressions and all

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.947 align:middle line:84%
of the other energy work
into my work with clients.

00:25:47.947 --> 00:25:49.482 align:middle line:84%
And what was extraordinary
as I began

00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:51.517 align:middle line:90%
to get much better results,

00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:55.388 align:middle line:84%
maybe because it was a
better blend with me.

00:25:55.388 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for other reasons,
but I begin to see

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.158 align:middle line:84%
that people were not
only getting better,

00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:90%
they were staying better.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.129 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before I would have
people come in with a problem.

00:26:03.129 --> 00:26:05.197 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
relieved but they'll be back

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:06.298 align:middle line:90%
in a few weeks times saying,

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.567 align:middle line:84%
"Oh it's come back"
or, you know, whatever.

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:12.171 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel like I was just
taking a plaster or a band aid

00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:15.374 align:middle line:84%
on their problem and
they were looking to me

00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:90%
to fix their body instead

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.046 align:middle line:84%
of taking responsibility
for their body.

00:26:20.046 --> 00:26:24.617 align:middle line:84%
And how I was beginning to work
then was helping people to see

00:26:24.617 --> 00:26:26.485 align:middle line:90%
that this was their issue.

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:29.455 align:middle line:84%
Let's work on it together,
I would be their guide

00:26:29.455 --> 00:26:32.191 align:middle line:84%
and together we could find a
way through but it would be

00:26:32.191 --> 00:26:35.961 align:middle line:84%
up to them to really take the
steps necessary whether those

00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:38.397 align:middle line:84%
were physical healing
steps, changing their diet,

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:41.867 align:middle line:84%
their nutrition or working on
their mental emotional side

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:45.404 align:middle line:84%
which began to sort of
fascinate me more and more.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:47.907 align:middle line:90%
I became like a detective trying

00:26:47.907 --> 00:26:50.176 align:middle line:84%
to determine what
was the precise cause

00:26:50.176 --> 00:26:53.913 align:middle line:84%
because we could get back
to that ultimate cause

00:26:53.913 --> 00:26:56.515 align:middle line:90%
where it all went off track.

00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:58.384 align:middle line:84%
We went off your
center and started

00:26:58.384 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:84%
to have these mistaken ways of
thinking that led to disease.

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:06.992 align:middle line:84%
Then it could be turned
around and you could go back

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:09.595 align:middle line:84%
to allowing the body
to heal itself.

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:13.699 align:middle line:84%
Unlike Bruce Lipton I totally
believe that the body is capable

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:15.601 align:middle line:90%
of healing any disease.

00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:17.937 align:middle line:84%
And I think that for every
disease known to man,

00:27:17.937 --> 00:27:20.473 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody, somewhere
who has healed it naturally

00:27:20.473 --> 00:27:23.042 align:middle line:84%
without any medical
intervention.

00:27:23.042 --> 00:27:24.643 align:middle line:84%
And thank goodness
we're beginning

00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to study people who've had
those spontaneous remissions.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.516 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've heard
about IONS out in California,

00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:33.986 align:middle line:84%
the Institute on Noetic
Science, I love them.

00:27:33.986 --> 00:27:35.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: A conference happening

00:27:35.087 --> 00:27:37.022 align:middle line:84%
in California very soon
too with them yeah.

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:38.257 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be going

00:27:38.257 --> 00:27:40.392 align:middle line:84%
on it [inaudible] I've
introduced Marilyn [assumed

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:41.427 align:middle line:84%
spelling] and some
other people there.

00:27:41.427 --> 00:27:42.561 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: She's one of
my favorite people

00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:45.231 align:middle line:84%
in the world really
inspiration to me.

00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:48.567 align:middle line:84%
They did a fantastic
research study into 1,

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:54.006 align:middle line:84%
554 people who'd had spontaneous
remissions from cancer.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:56.475 align:middle line:84%
And I wished I'd read
this study 20 years ago

00:27:56.475 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
but I only found it in 1974.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.981 align:middle line:84%
It was written up and Lynne
McTaggart's wonderful journal,

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:03.549 align:middle line:84%
you know, what doctors'
going to tell you.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:05.985 align:middle line:84%
And I found this article
and I went, "Wow!"

00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:08.587 align:middle line:84%
And in this article
it said, curiously all

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:12.758 align:middle line:84%
of these people did the same aid
mental and emotional changes.

00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:84%
I went, "Ooh," what were those
changes and they listed them

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:19.532 align:middle line:84%
and I went on this list and
then, tick, tick, tick, tick,

00:28:19.532 --> 00:28:22.001 align:middle line:90%
tick, oh, I've done them all.

00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:24.804 align:middle line:90%
No wonder I had healed at last.

00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:26.672 align:middle line:84%
So I thought how
helpful is this?.

00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:29.975 align:middle line:84%
This is the breadcrumbs
that everybody needs

00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:90%
to be able to look at it.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.079 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked more carefully
at the list and I thought,

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:37.249 align:middle line:84%
but this list-- this list
it's pretty heavy duty.

00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:40.653 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything on this list
requires quite a lot of work

00:28:40.653 --> 00:28:45.424 align:middle line:84%
like take a hundred percent
responsibility for your illness.

00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:48.427 align:middle line:84%
Not just saying, well, yes,
I think I had handed it.

00:28:48.427 --> 00:28:51.997 align:middle line:84%
Take a hundred percent of
responsibility for healing.

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:55.134 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a lot of
responsibility for most people.

00:28:55.134 --> 00:28:58.571 align:middle line:84%
But the more responsibility you
take the more opportunity you

00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:00.806 align:middle line:90%
have for healing.

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:02.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's so true in life.

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it? I mean all of
this we're talking about is

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.478 align:middle line:90%
of course applicable in life.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Absolutely.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.217 align:middle line:84%
In relationships, in your
success, in your work,

00:29:11.217 --> 00:29:13.586 align:middle line:84%
in your fulfillment,
everything especially

00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.921 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual path,
it really is about.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:17.256 align:middle line:90%
And taking a hundred percent

00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:20.793 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility really means
stepping into your center

00:29:20.793 --> 00:29:23.028 align:middle line:90%
and being who you are.

00:29:23.028 --> 00:29:26.832 align:middle line:84%
And what was weird was I hadn't
realized how far I'd stepped off

00:29:26.832 --> 00:29:28.234 align:middle line:90%
my center.

00:29:28.234 --> 00:29:33.739 align:middle line:84%
With all the best intentions, I
had absorbed cultural beliefs,

00:29:33.739 --> 00:29:37.643 align:middle line:84%
beliefs from my family
spiritual ideas and beliefs,

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:41.046 align:middle line:84%
learnings I had along the way
and they all sounded good to me.

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like you're
a fish in a fish bowl

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.986 align:middle line:84%
in the water you're not aware
of because you're swimming

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:48.087 align:middle line:90%
in this water everyday.

00:29:48.087 --> 00:29:50.155 align:middle line:84%
So it just feels like
you're in the world.

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:53.659 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was swimming in
my water of all my beliefs

00:29:53.659 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:90%
and it just looked normal to me.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Including some dreams
that were apparently hurting you

00:29:57.997 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:84%
so much from living
your truth now.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.335 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: This desire
to have the baby.

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:05.437 align:middle line:84%
Remember my plan for
perfect happiness.

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:06.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Your obsession

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: My obsession.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.375 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is becoming
like a tumor.

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:13.512 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that
was very, very much regarded

00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:15.547 align:middle line:90%
as one of the closest.

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:18.984 align:middle line:84%
What was curious was towards
the end of my 10 years sort

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:20.753 align:middle line:90%
of healing patch, I've came

00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:24.089 align:middle line:84%
across some more insidious
belief behind that one.

00:30:24.089 --> 00:30:27.092 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly remember that one
on my past life journeys,

00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:30.296 align:middle line:84%
this is a childhood journey,
I remembered what it felt

00:30:30.296 --> 00:30:34.066 align:middle line:84%
like to be a child
of about five or six,

00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:37.236 align:middle line:84%
my mother had been very ill for
many years, she a whole serious

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:40.139 align:middle line:84%
of illnesses minor ones but
things like strep throat

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:43.709 align:middle line:84%
and then she had her
thyroid completely collapsed

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:45.844 align:middle line:90%
and she had to go on thyroxin.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:48.881 align:middle line:84%
But she was always ill and
possibly because of some

00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:51.917 align:middle line:84%
of these illnesses
she was a bit grumpy.

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:53.352 align:middle line:90%
She was quite a bit grumpy

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.821 align:middle line:84%
and she was a lot
of fun to be around.

00:30:55.821 --> 00:30:59.224 align:middle line:90%
And she was tired all the time

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:03.562 align:middle line:84%
and she made everything she did
look like very, very hard work.

00:31:03.562 --> 00:31:08.133 align:middle line:84%
So what I got to see as a child
was being a mother is being

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:12.905 align:middle line:84%
like the slave who is working
so hard and being so miserable

00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:15.007 align:middle line:90%
and so grumpy and angry.

00:31:15.007 --> 00:31:19.445 align:middle line:84%
Never any fun, no playtime,
no encouragement, no cuddles,

00:31:19.445 --> 00:31:23.248 align:middle line:84%
no hugs, you know, that's what
I thought being a mother was.

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:27.052 align:middle line:84%
That went in as my template
for this is being a mother.

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:30.022 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, I grew up
with that template,

00:31:30.022 --> 00:31:31.924 align:middle line:84%
did I really want
to be like that?

00:31:31.924 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Did I really want to become
a mother there was a big part

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.596 align:middle line:84%
of my own conscious mind
that had that wound in it

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:39.798 align:middle line:84%
that said we're going to
protect you from that.

00:31:39.798 --> 00:31:42.901 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make sure you
never get pregnant really

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:46.005 align:middle line:84%
and become a mother 'cause
you'll be like your mother was.

00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:49.008 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I love my mother and
of course I would be like here

00:31:49.008 --> 00:31:51.243 align:middle line:84%
because I love her,
she was my role model.

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:54.079 align:middle line:84%
So part of my unconscious
mind was protecting me

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:56.515 align:middle line:90%
from this terrible faith.

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:59.418 align:middle line:84%
And curiously my
mother had always wanted

00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:01.387 align:middle line:90%
to be a bit of an adventurous.

00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:03.756 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to go out in
the world and do things

00:32:03.756 --> 00:32:07.393 align:middle line:84%
and go places and have
a career and stuff.

00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:10.596 align:middle line:84%
And she never was able to
because she had three children

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:13.799 align:middle line:84%
and in her generation it
wasn't so easy to do that.

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:17.503 align:middle line:84%
My father gave her no license
or encouragement to do that.

00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:18.303 align:middle line:90%
And she'd--

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: She's not the kind

00:32:19.338 --> 00:32:20.039 align:middle line:84%
that was a hundred
percent responsible

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:21.407 align:middle line:90%
for her life was she?

00:32:21.407 --> 00:32:24.143 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: No, in that generation
it was hard to be that way.

00:32:24.143 --> 00:32:27.312 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- that led
to her sense of frustration.

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:30.716 align:middle line:84%
And so she lived a little bit
vicariously through my sister

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:34.086 align:middle line:84%
and me and encouraged
us to go out in ways

00:32:34.086 --> 00:32:35.587 align:middle line:84%
that it was slightly
unconscious.

00:32:35.587 --> 00:32:38.791 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I got that, that
it was a really good idea to go

00:32:38.791 --> 00:32:41.894 align:middle line:84%
out to the world and do
everything and be everything

00:32:41.894 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and have this career, although
I wasn't career driven.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.232 align:middle line:84%
Remember I wanted to
have babies in the house

00:32:47.232 --> 00:32:49.902 align:middle line:84%
in the country 'cause I thought
that was perfect happiness

00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:52.938 align:middle line:84%
but instead I ended
up with this career.

00:32:52.938 --> 00:32:55.741 align:middle line:84%
And during this 10 year
patch, as my work began

00:32:55.741 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to change what also began
to change is I became more

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.913 align:middle line:84%
and more fulfilled
and fascinated

00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:02.448 align:middle line:90%
with what I was doing.

00:33:02.448 --> 00:33:06.652 align:middle line:84%
And over time I began to
really enjoy everything

00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:90%
about my life much more.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.524 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really notice
it until one day I woke

00:33:12.524 --> 00:33:14.526 align:middle line:84%
up one morning and I
was just feeling good.

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I woke feeling good and then
the black cloud would descend

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.398 align:middle line:90%
and I think, "Oh yeah.

00:33:19.398 --> 00:33:21.767 align:middle line:84%
And I got a brain
tumor to deal with".

00:33:21.767 --> 00:33:24.369 align:middle line:90%
and then I feel heavy.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:27.172 align:middle line:84%
And I think what can I do about
it today and then I tried to get

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:29.475 align:middle line:84%
that around my day and
hope I don't get a headache

00:33:29.475 --> 00:33:31.009 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:33.979 align:middle line:84%
And this day I heard this
little voice in my head,

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:36.014 align:middle line:90%
a very quiet little voice.

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, "Oh
I'm so fed up with this.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.119 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get
rid of this tumor.

00:33:40.119 --> 00:33:42.154 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to do
this anymore."

00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:45.858 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, it was about nine and
a half years into my process

00:33:45.858 --> 00:33:52.664 align:middle line:84%
and I heard this little voice
and I knew from my training

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and from my study of
a Course in Miracles

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.769 align:middle line:84%
that that was not
a loving thought.

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.104 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a totally
normal thought,

00:33:59.104 --> 00:34:02.808 align:middle line:84%
everybody thinks you should
have the desire to be well,

00:34:02.808 --> 00:34:05.577 align:middle line:84%
the desire to get rid
of your problem, right,

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:08.546 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a health problem
or relationship problem,

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:10.414 align:middle line:84%
work problem we want to
get rid of our problems.

00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:11.749 align:middle line:90%
We want to heal it really fast.

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.619 align:middle line:90%
The faster the better right?

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So to my conscious
mind that sounded

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:19.324 align:middle line:84%
like a good idea 'cause it was
my conscious ego mind talking.

00:34:19.324 --> 00:34:21.426 align:middle line:84%
But I realized with
my higher mind

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.162 align:middle line:90%
that was not a healing thought.

00:34:23.162 --> 00:34:25.697 align:middle line:84%
In fact it was quite
a murderous thought.

00:34:25.697 --> 00:34:27.733 align:middle line:84%
If that part of my
mind to had a gun,

00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:30.269 align:middle line:84%
it would have shot the tumor
to get rid of it, right?

00:34:30.269 --> 00:34:32.237 align:middle line:84%
It would have extracted
it with a knife.

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:34.706 align:middle line:84%
It would have, you know,
anything to get rid of it.

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:37.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought, "Huh, I have
an internal conflict,

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:41.513 align:middle line:84%
'cause if one part of my mind is
feeling so murderous and wanting

00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:44.716 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of it and the
rest of me is going yes

00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:47.586 align:middle line:84%
but we're healers, we're
in the spiritual space,

00:34:47.586 --> 00:34:50.789 align:middle line:84%
we're wanting lo love it
better and be in a better place

00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:53.091 align:middle line:84%
and be calmed and,
you know, centered

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:56.461 align:middle line:84%
and all this good stuff,
I thought I got a problem

00:34:56.461 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:84%
because the truth is I
do want to get rid of it.

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:03.902 align:middle line:84%
I was that honest that I could
say to myself, oh my god,

00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:07.406 align:middle line:84%
I do have that thought and I
do believe I want to get rid

00:35:07.406 --> 00:35:09.975 align:middle line:84%
of it otherwise I
wouldn't have that thought.

00:35:09.975 --> 00:35:13.946 align:middle line:84%
This is where my NLP really
helped me, so I thought OK,

00:35:13.946 --> 00:35:17.449 align:middle line:84%
now we know the issue, we
know how to resolve conflicts.

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:20.886 align:middle line:84%
So I took a big long broad
view of my whole life,

00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:24.122 align:middle line:84%
did a whole time line in
my head of looking back

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:26.291 align:middle line:84%
to where I have been
10 years before.

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:30.362 align:middle line:84%
I remembered my dream of
wanting the house in the country

00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:34.032 align:middle line:84%
of the 2.5 children and, you
know, the horse, and the cat

00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:37.569 align:middle line:84%
and the dog and the wonderful
husband supporting everything

00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:42.674 align:middle line:84%
and being a wonderful man, and I
thought nothing wrong with that.

00:35:42.674 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But look where I have come,
look what's happened instead.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.981 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting that dream,
I've had the opportunity

00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:51.617 align:middle line:84%
to meet all these
amazing trainers,

00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:54.786 align:middle line:90%
teachers, healers, psychics.

00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:58.223 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to go around the
world and all these trainings.

00:35:58.223 --> 00:36:00.959 align:middle line:84%
I've read all these books,
I've had all these information,

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:03.562 align:middle line:84%
I got walls covered
with certificates.

00:36:03.562 --> 00:36:04.329 align:middle line:90%
My work has--

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:05.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: An affirmations

00:36:05.931 --> 00:36:08.667 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: Affirmations, yes.

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:11.336 align:middle line:90%
My-- my work had changed.

00:36:11.336 --> 00:36:15.741 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
different kind of healer.

00:36:15.741 --> 00:36:17.542 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
what's really interesting

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:22.347 align:middle line:84%
about this picture is I really
like who I am now and I didn't

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.983 align:middle line:90%
like myself back then as much.

00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:29.921 align:middle line:84%
Now I really feel OK with
myself, you know faults and all,

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.257 align:middle line:84%
tumor and all, I
feel OK with myself

00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and I thought wow,
that's a big growth.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.929 align:middle line:84%
And I thought you know I
wouldn't done all of that.

00:36:36.929 --> 00:36:39.531 align:middle line:84%
I would never spend all that
money, I would have ever gone

00:36:39.531 --> 00:36:42.134 align:middle line:84%
around the world doing all
those workshops and training all

00:36:42.134 --> 00:36:43.368 align:middle line:84%
that stuff and reading
all these books,

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.871 align:middle line:90%
I would never have done that.

00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:49.174 align:middle line:84%
I thought so I was stimulated
and encouraged and motivated

00:36:49.174 --> 00:36:51.376 align:middle line:90%
by my tumor to do that stuff.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:56.648 align:middle line:84%
So whatever part of me is making
the tumor must know better

00:36:56.648 --> 00:37:00.152 align:middle line:84%
because it's given me a better
life, a better fulfillment

00:37:00.152 --> 00:37:01.386 align:middle line:84%
and better growth
and development

00:37:01.386 --> 00:37:03.588 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't have
given myself.

00:37:03.588 --> 00:37:05.958 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's interesting
'cause you know what was

00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:09.428 align:middle line:84%
puzzling me at nine years
was why is it still there?

00:37:09.428 --> 00:37:11.596 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing all these
wonderful things.

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.864 align:middle line:90%
Why is it still there?

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So I asked that questions,
so why is it still there?

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And the answer came back well
maybe there is something else

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.039 align:middle line:90%
that you still need to learn.

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:22.908 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's another
workshop you need to do,

00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:24.443 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's some other
book you need to read,

00:37:24.443 --> 00:37:27.546 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's another place you
need to visit around the world

00:37:27.546 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
to have yet another
spiritual experience.

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:32.017 align:middle line:90%
Is that so bad?

00:37:32.017 --> 00:37:36.188 align:middle line:84%
I went, no, that's
great, another adventure.

00:37:36.188 --> 00:37:39.157 align:middle line:84%
So at that point I started
to recognize the part

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:42.427 align:middle line:84%
that it created my tumor
was my friend, my guide,

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:44.663 align:middle line:90%
my teacher, my mentor.

00:37:44.663 --> 00:37:46.698 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I can trust it,

00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:48.967 align:middle line:84%
because it's always
had a better idea

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:52.537 align:middle line:84%
about what would help
me grow than I had.

00:37:52.537 --> 00:37:56.274 align:middle line:84%
So in total genuine
honesty I could then say

00:37:56.274 --> 00:38:00.178 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, I don't need
to get rid of the tumor anymore.

00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:04.116 align:middle line:84%
In fact I give it
permission to stay to the end

00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:07.119 align:middle line:90%
of my days, I totally accept it.

00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:09.988 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
time I'd really gotten

00:38:09.988 --> 00:38:13.658 align:middle line:84%
to a hundred percent
acceptance of my tumor.

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:16.128 align:middle line:84%
>> LiLou: And there's
gratitude too for it.

00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:18.797 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Gratitude
as well and trust.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in a place of total
open handed surrender.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.002 align:middle line:90%
And you know what happened next?

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:26.772 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting,
I forgot I had it.

00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:29.408 align:middle line:84%
I never woke up with
that black cloud again.

00:38:29.408 --> 00:38:30.642 align:middle line:90%
I forgot I had a tumor.

00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:33.645 align:middle line:84%
I just got on with my
life, nothing changed.

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:35.814 align:middle line:90%
I just forgot I had a tumor.

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:39.284 align:middle line:84%
And six months later I had
to for my usual blood test

00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:44.489 align:middle line:84%
and I went to see my lovely
doctor and I handed him the test

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.191 align:middle line:84%
and I said, it looks
a little bit funny

00:38:46.191 --> 00:38:50.095 align:middle line:84%
because the blood
test is done to 450

00:38:50.095 --> 00:38:52.063 align:middle line:84%
which is well be in
the normal range.

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.766 align:middle line:84%
I said, maybe it's
a mistake, you know,

00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:58.303 align:middle line:84%
and by then of course 10
years had gone by I was 50

00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:02.674 align:middle line:84%
and I said maybe it's
because I'm getting so old.

00:39:02.674 --> 00:39:05.110 align:middle line:90%
That's, you know--

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: The range changed.

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AE: My hormones have changed.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:84%
I said, "No", no he said, "Look
the other things on the test,

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.352 align:middle line:90%
they're all totally normal.

00:39:14.352 --> 00:39:16.021 align:middle line:90%
This is a normal result.

00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:20.158 align:middle line:84%
Your tumor has stopped producing
high levels of prolactin."

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:24.663 align:middle line:84%
He said, "This can only mean
one thing, your tumor has gone."

00:39:24.663 --> 00:39:27.199 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I was
just like, "Wow, really?"

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:29.801 align:middle line:84%
and he said yes, he
said and, you know,

00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:31.403 align:middle line:90%
I don't how you've done this.

00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:33.738 align:middle line:90%
This is a real credit to you.

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:36.475 align:middle line:84%
And then he went on to
say, "I've been seeing you

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:40.445 align:middle line:84%
for over 10 years and you
are not the same person,

00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:41.847 align:middle line:90%
you were 10 years ago."

00:39:41.847 --> 00:39:48.453 align:middle line:84%
He said, "This is been amazing
to watch" and he gave me a hug.

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:51.189 align:middle line:84%
And I was quite sad, and I
nearly had a tear in my eyes,

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:54.526 align:middle line:84%
as I left his office 'cause I
realized I wouldn't have the

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:56.995 align:middle line:84%
excuse to come and see him
again because, you know,

00:39:56.995 --> 00:39:59.865 align:middle line:84%
we were on national health
by then and I couldn't go

00:39:59.865 --> 00:40:01.867 align:middle line:90%
and see him willy-nilly so.

00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Awesome, so this is--

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:84%
so the practical
aspect of the miracle.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.943 align:middle line:84%
The practical aspect to us
is to really accept this--

00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:14.579 align:middle line:90%
this acceptance for it.

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
This gratitude for it,
this trust and then all

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.385 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden it actually
spoke you the--

00:40:20.385 --> 00:40:22.354 align:middle line:84%
the biggest message
of your life,

00:40:22.354 --> 00:40:24.089 align:middle line:90%
he was the biggest blessing.

00:40:24.089 --> 00:40:27.926 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: And it's curious because
our whole culture is about,

00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:84%
you know, having the will
to live fighting the--

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:33.298 align:middle line:84%
the illness, the
battle to survive.

00:40:33.298 --> 00:40:35.967 align:middle line:84%
The battle against cancer,
the battle against aids,

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:39.304 align:middle line:84%
the battle against whatever
disease you're suffering with.

00:40:39.304 --> 00:40:42.207 align:middle line:84%
And we have the same attitude
towards our career, you know?

00:40:42.207 --> 00:40:44.843 align:middle line:84%
We got to go out there
and fight the good fight

00:40:44.843 --> 00:40:46.878 align:middle line:84%
and the world is a
jungle and, you know,

00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:49.047 align:middle line:90%
it's all about competition.

00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, really
the opposite is true.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:56.021 align:middle line:84%
It's starting from that place
of-- this is interesting.

00:40:56.021 --> 00:40:57.422 align:middle line:90%
Well, how can we accept this?

00:40:57.422 --> 00:41:00.392 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not a
small thing to do.

00:41:00.392 --> 00:41:03.495 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard when you are
faced with the crisis and say,

00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:05.764 align:middle line:84%
"this is an interesting
experience" what can--

00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:07.632 align:middle line:90%
how can I accept this?

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:10.735 align:middle line:84%
But if you did, if you
could start from that place

00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:14.606 align:middle line:84%
and then have the curiosity
to explore it and discover,

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:16.808 align:middle line:90%
so why have I created this?

00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:18.677 align:middle line:90%
How have I invited this?

00:41:18.677 --> 00:41:22.614 align:middle line:84%
What thoughts in my thought
system have contributed

00:41:22.614 --> 00:41:25.016 align:middle line:90%
to this being the way it is?

00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:27.118 align:middle line:84%
And we also make
a mistake I think,

00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:28.320 align:middle line:90%
especially in the western world.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.089 align:middle line:90%
We think we need to analyze it.

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:33.825 align:middle line:84%
And I think, you know, even in
my case I spend a lot of time

00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:37.596 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it wasn't time well
spent in analyzing, you know,

00:41:37.596 --> 00:41:42.033 align:middle line:84%
my childhood, my psychology, you
know, all that sort of stuff.

00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:44.336 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be that complicated.

00:41:44.336 --> 00:41:47.706 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's much simpler
than that is really listening

00:41:47.706 --> 00:41:51.876 align:middle line:84%
to the repetitive thoughts,
because they give you the clues.

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:55.313 align:middle line:84%
And luckily there's a lot of
people now working in this way

00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:59.384 align:middle line:84%
from lots of different angles
and they are able to zero

00:41:59.384 --> 00:42:03.388 align:middle line:84%
in more quickly on and
discover some of these mistake

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:07.592 align:middle line:84%
and aberrant thoughts that are
not helpful to our systems.

00:42:07.592 --> 00:42:10.462 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day I
think that healing as much

00:42:10.462 --> 00:42:13.531 align:middle line:84%
as everything else is part
of our spiritual path.

00:42:13.531 --> 00:42:18.103 align:middle line:84%
It can be a huge asset
to helping one grow

00:42:18.103 --> 00:42:20.305 align:middle line:90%
if you look at that way.

00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:22.874 align:middle line:84%
It's tempting to see it is the
worst thing that ever happened

00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:26.878 align:middle line:84%
to you but in fact it can be the
best thing that ever happened.

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:28.613 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people come up
tome and say, you know,

00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I agree it was the best thing
that ever happened, it forced me

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.786 align:middle line:84%
to do this, it made
me stop doing that

00:42:34.786 --> 00:42:39.324 align:middle line:84%
and I left my relationship or
I made up and forgave somebody,

00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:42.594 align:middle line:90%
you know, it leads to growth.

00:42:42.594 --> 00:42:46.731 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is always
a huge part of it.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:51.269 align:middle line:84%
And what was also interesting to
me was because my journey took

00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:56.274 align:middle line:84%
so long, I learned a long
slow way of doing it.

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:59.444 align:middle line:84%
But as a look back and retrace
my steps I could see the

00:42:59.444 --> 00:43:00.912 align:middle line:90%
stepping stones.

00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:03.882 align:middle line:84%
So that I can now help other
people find those stepping

00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:07.052 align:middle line:84%
stones, but because I did
all the work in between,

00:43:07.052 --> 00:43:10.522 align:middle line:84%
I have like the full
understanding of it.

00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:14.192 align:middle line:84%
And I realized with hindsight,
if I had healed in two weeks

00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:18.763 align:middle line:84%
or two months, I wouldn't have
had that, that level of depth

00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:22.033 align:middle line:84%
of understand and the
humility that comes with it

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:24.202 align:middle line:90%
when you don't heal instantly.

00:43:24.202 --> 00:43:26.471 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think to myself
well maybe if I'd healed

00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in two months I would have
had stand on the soapbox

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.109 align:middle line:84%
at Hyde Park Corner
and shout to the world,

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:33.344 align:middle line:84%
"Eureka I have the
cure for cancer."

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:36.748 align:middle line:84%
But now because it took me 10
years I can't possibly say that.

00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:40.085 align:middle line:84%
All I can do is gently encourage
people to have the faith

00:43:40.085 --> 00:43:43.955 align:middle line:84%
to continue working until
they find the answers.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful, and though,

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and though there's some
really instant healing

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.064 align:middle line:84%
that really do bring to
humbleness and do bring

00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:56.634 align:middle line:84%
to amazing insights, all of this
sort of like I really do feel

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:58.203 align:middle line:84%
like it's not about
so much the time,

00:43:58.203 --> 00:43:59.904 align:middle line:90%
it's what the time you needed.

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:03.208 align:middle line:84%
And all is good short,
long whatever it takes.

00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we have
it in a nutshell,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.112 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it takes longer

00:44:07.112 --> 00:44:10.281 align:middle line:84%
but in the end do we feel
good, you know, and free.

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:12.117 align:middle line:90%
And you look free and very happy

00:44:12.117 --> 00:44:13.752 align:middle line:84%
and I love the light
in your eyes.

00:44:13.752 --> 00:44:16.488 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had this other
camera that would zoom

00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:19.224 align:middle line:84%
in into these beautiful
amazing eyes.

00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:21.726 align:middle line:84%
It's just a huge
ocean, so I could tell,

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:25.196 align:middle line:84%
how much wisdom you have and
the beauty you have inside

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:26.564 align:middle line:90%
shines out.

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:28.566 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole
process about shining

00:44:28.566 --> 00:44:31.202 align:middle line:84%
out is what we really
have inside.

00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:32.303 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
a living miracle.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.676 align:middle line:84%
>> AE: Isn't, you know, I also
want to say what's the worse

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:40.845 align:middle line:84%
that could happen
if you did this?

00:44:40.845 --> 00:44:43.648 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you started
exploring a few of your thoughts

00:44:43.648 --> 00:44:46.551 align:middle line:84%
and you made better choices
about those thoughts,

00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:47.652 align:middle line:84%
what's the worst
that could happen?

00:44:47.652 --> 00:44:49.721 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
a little bit lighter.

00:44:49.721 --> 00:44:51.956 align:middle line:84%
You might not get a
total healing instantly

00:44:51.956 --> 00:44:53.358 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to feel
a little bit lighter

00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and then a little bit lighter
and a little bit more lighter,

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.496 align:middle line:84%
little bit better, a little bit
better, a little bit better.

00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:02.066 align:middle line:84%
We make the mistake and
thinking that the actual healing

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:04.736 align:middle line:84%
of the physical symptom
is the healing.

00:45:04.736 --> 00:45:08.106 align:middle line:84%
And real healing is the
inner state, you know,

00:45:08.106 --> 00:45:11.075 align:middle line:84%
there are some health issues
that can not be healed.

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:14.112 align:middle line:84%
But the person inside
is beautiful,

00:45:14.112 --> 00:45:15.513 align:middle line:90%
perfect, whole and complete.

00:45:15.513 --> 00:45:16.848 align:middle line:90%
I mean look free.

00:45:16.848 --> 00:45:19.884 align:middle line:84%
You look at somebody like
Stephen Hawking as an example,

00:45:19.884 --> 00:45:22.153 align:middle line:84%
you know, his illness
has not ever healed

00:45:22.153 --> 00:45:25.089 align:middle line:84%
and can not be healed but
has he had a full life?

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.591 align:middle line:84%
Has he-- how many
books is he written?

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:84%
How many, you know,
children has he had?

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:31.262 align:middle line:84%
You know he's had a
few marriages, does--

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:32.897 align:middle line:84%
does he have a full
life absolutely?

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:35.400 align:middle line:84%
He have completed,
fulfilled human being?

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.801 align:middle line:90%
I would say so.

00:45:36.801 --> 00:45:41.005 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the healing,
the inner state is the healing

00:45:41.005 --> 00:45:43.274 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
very important.

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:47.045 align:middle line:84%
It's also what happened to me
over the long period of time

00:45:47.045 --> 00:45:50.615 align:middle line:84%
as I learned how to
development resilience

00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:53.952 align:middle line:84%
and resilience is now
being taught here,

00:45:53.952 --> 00:45:55.286 align:middle line:90%
there and everywhere.

00:45:55.286 --> 00:45:57.155 align:middle line:84%
But it's not something you
can instantly learn like that.

00:45:57.155 --> 00:46:00.091 align:middle line:84%
It's something that has
to grow as a process

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:01.693 align:middle line:90%
or things that help it.

00:46:01.693 --> 00:46:04.262 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't a spontaneous
thing.

00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.664 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, when Hay House
asked me to write a book

00:46:06.664 --> 00:46:09.534 align:middle line:84%
on resilience, I, you
know, I thought it first,

00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:12.237 align:middle line:84%
"Do I really know the
steps to resilience?"

00:46:12.237 --> 00:46:15.273 align:middle line:84%
And then when I looked
at my journey I--

00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:17.108 align:middle line:84%
well if I don't know
the steps to resilience,

00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:20.645 align:middle line:84%
who does because what it
took just to hang in there

00:46:20.645 --> 00:46:23.448 align:middle line:84%
for 10 years was
resilience, you know,

00:46:23.448 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really
feel I had a choice.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.151 align:middle line:84%
I mean what was the
choice I had?

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.687 align:middle line:84%
I either kept on doing
the work or I suffered.

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:31.856 align:middle line:90%
I mean easy choice to make.

00:46:31.856 --> 00:46:34.659 align:middle line:84%
But actually that's the same
choice everybody has, you know,

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:37.362 align:middle line:90%
either you grow or you suffer.

00:46:37.362 --> 00:46:40.164 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're going to suffer
the consequence of holding

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:43.301 align:middle line:84%
on to those mistake and
beliefs, or you're going

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
to get the benefits of
every little piece of growth

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.373 align:middle line:84%
and every little
choice that you make.

00:46:48.373 --> 00:46:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I began to see it as what a
Course in Miracle says, it is--

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.315 align:middle line:84%
it is always a choice
between choosing love or fear,

00:46:57.315 --> 00:47:01.019 align:middle line:84%
the choosing of love based
thoughts of fear based thought.

00:47:01.019 --> 00:47:04.055 align:middle line:84%
And everything that doesn't
lead you to a love based thought

00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:07.759 align:middle line:84%
where your-- in your own center
or your feeling at peace,

00:47:07.759 --> 00:47:11.029 align:middle line:90%
relaxed joyful, happy,

00:47:11.029 --> 00:47:14.499 align:middle line:84%
if it isn't love-based
then it's the other one.

00:47:14.499 --> 00:47:16.167 align:middle line:84%
And I think it the
western world,

00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:18.002 align:middle line:90%
we make this slight mistake

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:84%
of thinking there's this
objective middle ground

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:22.273 align:middle line:90%
of thinking you know.

00:47:22.273 --> 00:47:24.509 align:middle line:90%
But I'm being reasonable.

00:47:24.509 --> 00:47:27.412 align:middle line:84%
I'm being intellectual,
I'm being, I'm having,

00:47:27.412 --> 00:47:30.715 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking a perspective on
this, an objective perspective.

00:47:30.715 --> 00:47:32.283 align:middle line:90%
There is no middle ground.

00:47:32.283 --> 00:47:35.453 align:middle line:84%
And when you actually
explore some

00:47:35.453 --> 00:47:38.556 align:middle line:84%
of those rational
objective reasonable ideas

00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:41.259 align:middle line:84%
in your own head, you would
discover that at the root

00:47:41.259 --> 00:47:43.428 align:middle line:90%
of them they're based in fear.

00:47:43.428 --> 00:47:46.631 align:middle line:84%
They're based in some kind of
sense of, if I don't do this,

00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:49.667 align:middle line:84%
you know, I will come to
harm or the body will die

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:51.803 align:middle line:84%
or it's based on
fear in some way.

00:47:51.803 --> 00:47:54.806 align:middle line:84%
Say, it's easy to
identify your own thoughts

00:47:54.806 --> 00:47:57.108 align:middle line:84%
of whether they're
loved of fear based.

00:47:57.108 --> 00:47:59.344 align:middle line:84%
One is going to leave
you feeling great.

00:47:59.344 --> 00:48:01.312 align:middle line:90%
And one is not.

00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:05.383 align:middle line:84%
And it's that ability to
be mindful of what's going

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:09.787 align:middle line:84%
on in every little choice
of thought we think.

00:48:09.787 --> 00:48:13.124 align:middle line:84%
Before it comes out of
our mouth, before we tread

00:48:13.124 --> 00:48:15.259 align:middle line:84%
down the path and
spiral down into one

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of those you know chain reaction
thoughts and run a whole movie

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.832 align:middle line:90%
and end up in a bad state.

00:48:20.832 --> 00:48:23.034 align:middle line:84%
To be mindful of
the thoughts and go,

00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:84%
how was that that just
went through my head?

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:28.573 align:middle line:84%
I just reacted to that
or that, you know,

00:48:28.573 --> 00:48:30.708 align:middle line:90%
what's-- what's going on here?

00:48:30.708 --> 00:48:33.378 align:middle line:84%
How could I think
differently about this?

00:48:33.378 --> 00:48:34.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful, I've

00:48:34.712 --> 00:48:38.082 align:middle line:84%
so enjoyed this conversation
Arielle, thank you so much.

00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:40.084 align:middle line:84%
Thank you Juicy co-creators
for watching.

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:42.754 align:middle line:84%
I know you got-- you
got lots out of this.

00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:48.259 align:middle line:84%
I am-- let's choose
love shall we?

00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:53.231 align:middle line:84%
I send you lots-- lots of big
kiss and warm flats from--

00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:56.134 align:middle line:84%
from beautiful London
thank you so much.

00:48:56.134 --> 00:48:58.269 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
reading Practical Miracles.

00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.604 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
