00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my juicy
co-creators, Lilou here.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.651 align:middle line:84%
I'm in London in England
with a Dutch guy in London.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:18.352 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.153 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Tim.

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:19.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Tim van der Vliet: Hello.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:20.588 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:21.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Good.

00:00:21.922 --> 00:00:24.725 align:middle line:84%
I like-- this is, this is
very much a capital in Europe.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:28.462 align:middle line:84%
This is-- a lot of people from
the U.S. are watching this video

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.698 align:middle line:84%
and Gaiam is this
beautiful community,

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:32.133 align:middle line:90%
very much spiritually aware.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.434 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Um huh.

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And I'm excited to
do this interview together

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and speak of your book and your
adventure and your discovery.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.643 align:middle line:84%
To me you're, you're what it is
to be a human being, you know,

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.212 align:middle line:90%
enjoying life and having fun.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.915 align:middle line:84%
And you made one of your, I
guess your dream come true

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.318 align:middle line:84%
or I don't know, you had a
radical kind of change of life,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.722 align:middle line:84%
though on the outside, because
technically inside you're still

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:57.591 align:middle line:84%
the same person enjoying
your ride.

00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But, you, you wrote this
book, "Spiritual Awakening"

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.296 align:middle line:84%
with Hayhouse, but you
used to be a trader.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yes.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Like you
know we're here

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.134 align:middle line:84%
in this big financial capital
here in London and you used

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:08.335 align:middle line:90%
to trade for 13 years.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:09.336 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.204 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
For 13 years, yes.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Wow.

00:01:11.272 --> 00:01:12.239 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
So, I've been working

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:14.575 align:middle line:84%
in Amsterdam on the
auction floor.

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.678 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
trading floor.

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
You know these guys with the
collared jackets and they're,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.348 align:middle line:90%
the whole day they are screaming

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.184 align:middle line:84%
and nobody understands
anything of it.

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:24.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:24.685 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
This was my job.

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.885 align:middle line:90%
>>> Lilou: Wow.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.854 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And
yeah, the funny thing was

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:28.856 align:middle line:90%
that I loved to do it.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
So, back then I was
doing what I like

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.028 align:middle line:90%
and I'm still doing what I like.

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.897 align:middle line:84%
But, it seems like an
extremely big change.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:37.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:38.933 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But, you made-- you
had some big lessons there

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:42.369 align:middle line:84%
because you talk a little
bit about it in your book.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.238 align:middle line:84%
But, actually back then
you learned some things

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:45.906 align:middle line:84%
about the ego and
some other things--

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: On how
to deal with that.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:48.742 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- I thought
it was quite interesting.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.013 align:middle line:84%
And so I came fresh from
university and I studied a lot

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
about options and
portfolio management,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.519 align:middle line:84%
everything that has
to do with finance.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.454 align:middle line:90%
And then I started working.

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
On my first day I heard
my boss saying listen,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.027 align:middle line:84%
I want you to forget everything
you learned at the university.

00:02:07.027 --> 00:02:10.431 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be a blank page
for a moment, a clean sheet.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:11.765 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, forget everything.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:14.668 align:middle line:84%
There's only two things that
are important for a trader.

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.738 align:middle line:84%
The first is a trader
doesn't have a big ego,

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:21.542 align:middle line:84%
because if you have an ego
it shows in either fear;

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:25.112 align:middle line:84%
being fearful or being too
big for your boots, you know.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.648 align:middle line:84%
You know the saying that you
feel so good about yourself

00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:30.451 align:middle line:90%
that you are like number one.

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:35.089 align:middle line:84%
This is both ego and if you do
that as a trader you're going

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.192 align:middle line:84%
to make mistakes and
you're going to lose money.

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:40.026 align:middle line:84%
And the second lesson,
the second feature

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:44.365 align:middle line:84%
of a good trader is that a good
trader is always in the moment.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:47.368 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you just did your worst

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
or your best trade
ever in your life.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.404 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.573 align:middle line:90%
There's only the trade to come.

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:54.842 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the-- yeah,
it's really amazing

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:58.245 align:middle line:84%
that you learn this on
the auction exchange.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:01.215 align:middle line:84%
You know your first lesson it's
very spiritual you could say.

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:04.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, because from
the outside we could see bankers

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:07.187 align:middle line:84%
or traders you know
as creating a big mess

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:11.191 align:middle line:84%
and just people they're thinking
of their own, you know of money

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.694 align:middle line:84%
and of their own
sake, but no huh?

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:14.828 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: No.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:15.529 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Just a little
bit different insight.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.665 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think everything
is always different

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:18.766 align:middle line:90%
than we think it is.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.602 align:middle line:84%
And we put too much
weight on what we think

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.937 align:middle line:84%
and we give it too
much importance.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.606 align:middle line:90%
And I think that spirituality

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:28.275 align:middle line:84%
in general is just
following your intuition.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:31.278 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
matter if you're a banker

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.714 align:middle line:90%
or a yoga teacher or a farmer.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
If you follow your intuition
you're basically helping the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.918 align:middle line:90%
world further.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.553 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
at the same time

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.523 align:middle line:84%
that after 13 years I
felt my energy going down

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:45.826 align:middle line:84%
and it was time to
stop, you know.

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.862 align:middle line:84%
So, there is also a time
that you think well,

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
okay I don't feel like
playing this game anymore.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.535 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:55.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: A different game.

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:59.073 align:middle line:84%
What kind of game is that
then because to write a book

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.375 align:middle line:84%
and to decide to
self-publish after,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:05.846 align:middle line:84%
after being a trader what a
change in lifestyle or security

00:04:05.846 --> 00:04:07.081 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you want to call it?

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.049 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to face
some fear to get there?

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:09.817 align:middle line:90%
I mean what was that?

00:04:09.817 --> 00:04:10.718 align:middle line:90%
Was there a tipping point?

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:11.785 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually there
was a certain moment

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.557 align:middle line:84%
in my trading period
where I lost all my money

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:17.925 align:middle line:90%
in six months' time.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
So, I had 600,000 Euros and I
lost it in six months' time.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.399 align:middle line:84%
And this was my six
months of being in fear.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.836 align:middle line:84%
I completely stepped
into my fear.

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:34.141 align:middle line:84%
And it started with worries of
losing all the money that I had.

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:38.178 align:middle line:84%
And because I crawled into
that fear and I only saw

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that, I didn't sleep well and
I-- it was a terrible period.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.586 align:middle line:90%
But, because of that period

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:48.756 align:middle line:84%
after six months
I lost everything

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:51.925 align:middle line:84%
and the funny thing was that
the day after I lost everything

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
so you have to imagine
that six months

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.764 align:middle line:84%
of almost no sleep
and just pure panic.

00:04:56.764 --> 00:05:00.167 align:middle line:84%
And after six months
I lost everything

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.436 align:middle line:90%
and I also lost my fear.

00:05:02.436 --> 00:05:04.171 align:middle line:90%
So, I was actually relieved

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because it was all
gone including my fear.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.344 align:middle line:84%
And I learned there that being
fearful of losing something

00:05:10.344 --> 00:05:14.581 align:middle line:84%
for example, is actually worse
than losing that something is.

00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:15.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:19.887 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: So, this
was my true facing my fears.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:24.858 align:middle line:84%
I had a few more, but you know
that this was before that.

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
But, this was really, really
something where I learned

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.332 align:middle line:84%
that if you're afraid
of something--

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:33.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:37.571 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: It's actually
worse than that what you fear.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Um yeah,
such a powerful lesson.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I mean I love
those little things

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.978 align:middle line:84%
and I love this book oh my God,
with all these-- it's just--

00:05:44.978 --> 00:05:47.614 align:middle line:84%
it's very simple and goes
straight to the point.

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:50.017 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, there's
a dog on this cover.

00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:51.517 align:middle line:90%
You have to tell us.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean the word dog,
God backwards.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.591 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Well--

00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I mean where did
that came from, my God?

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:00.761 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:03.664 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know this my
whole life actually.

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:07.034 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is not so original.

00:06:07.034 --> 00:06:10.971 align:middle line:84%
But, did you ever realize that
God spelled backwards is dog?

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: No.

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:12.873 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: It makes
you think doesn't it?

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:14.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah it does.

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:15.943 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well,
the thing is with dog is

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:19.546 align:middle line:84%
in this book in the beginning
I write something about gurus,

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:21.682 align:middle line:84%
a thought on gurus
and their followers.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.618 align:middle line:90%
And I think gurus don't exist.

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:25.886 align:middle line:90%
Your guru is you.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.221 align:middle line:90%
My guru is me.

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:30.424 align:middle line:84%
So, the only guru everybody
has is their own intuition.

00:06:30.424 --> 00:06:32.993 align:middle line:84%
You should only follow and
listen to your own intuition

00:06:32.993 --> 00:06:34.761 align:middle line:90%
and nobody else, yeah.

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.765 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody is telling you
that they know better than you,

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:42.302 align:middle line:84%
run away yeah, because
gurus don't exist.

00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:43.704 align:middle line:84%
But, then further
in the book you find

00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:48.141 align:middle line:84%
out that I do have a guru,
which is the neighbor's dog,

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.045 align:middle line:84%
because he's so spiritual
because he doesn't worry

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:54.448 align:middle line:84%
about the balls and he
doesn't worry about the future.

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:90%
And he's very easily happy.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.388 align:middle line:84%
You know if you feed him and
you walk him he's a happy

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:02.556 align:middle line:90%
person actually.

00:07:02.556 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I learned.

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:05.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: He loves
unconditionally.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And he
loves unconditionally, yeah.

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:11.765 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- so this
is my spiritual teacher.

00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the dog really
exists, yeah.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.738 align:middle line:84%
So, and-- I'm very much
inspired by everything

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:21.208 align:middle line:84%
around me also the so-called
bad stuff or the dark stuff.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
It inspires me too.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.478 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Okay, we'll
go back into that,

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:28.315 align:middle line:84%
because I love the dark,
black is beautiful.

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:30.417 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, yeah,
yeah that's another thing.

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:35.522 align:middle line:84%
No but about the dog, so I see
Sammy, which is a pseudo name

00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:38.425 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't want
me to use his real name.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That is so cute.

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.329 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:43.897 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well, I think
it's important to make fun,

00:07:43.897 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
even if it's making
fun about spirituality.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.601 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:07:47.601 --> 00:07:48.435 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You know
I think it's very spiritual

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:49.303 align:middle line:90%
to make fun about spirituality.

00:07:49.303 --> 00:07:50.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh yeah.

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:51.505 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: But,
so gurus don't exist.

00:07:51.505 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:90%
But then, you find out later

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.309 align:middle line:84%
in the book I do have a
guru, the neighbor's dog.

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:56.543 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so full of my guru

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:59.179 align:middle line:84%
that as this true old
school spiritual author,

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.815 align:middle line:84%
I dedicated my book
to my guru Sammy.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.818 align:middle line:84%
It says here to Sammy, my
teacher and the neighbor's dog.

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:05.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Aw.

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:06.853 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And
I'm so full of him

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:07.421 align:middle line:84%
that I even put him
on the cover.

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:08.121 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Aw.

00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:08.922 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:10.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: He is so adorable.

00:08:10.123 --> 00:08:11.258 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: This is
the story about the dog.

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:12.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:15.929 align:middle line:84%
So, did he, did he help you, I
mean through a certain moment

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:18.832 align:middle line:84%
in time or this is in
reference for your whole journey

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.867 align:middle line:84%
and you thought this is
a perfect incarnation

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
of what I've learned
or how do you?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.505 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well, I was
sitting in front of my house.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.641 align:middle line:90%
This is my chill place.

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:31.478 align:middle line:84%
I live on a square and
I have four children

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:84%
and they're playing
in front of me.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:37.284 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just sitting with a
book or with my notebook writing

00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:39.853 align:middle line:84%
and basically you could
call it meditating,

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:44.258 align:middle line:90%
you know staring in front of me.

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, I saw him
and it really struck me

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.129 align:middle line:90%
that this is so spiritual.

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.897 align:middle line:90%
But, it's not only about dogs.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:54.501 align:middle line:84%
It's about cats, cats
or whatever animal.

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.902 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:59.406 align:middle line:84%
If you open your eyes, you
truly open your eyes you can be

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.475 align:middle line:84%
inspired by everything
and anything.

00:09:01.475 --> 00:09:04.711 align:middle line:84%
So I say, there's no
gurus but everybody

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.346 align:middle line:90%
in your life path is a teacher--

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:07.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Including the
neighbor's dog or your cat--

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:11.351 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Or whatever.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:15.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love that you say
God is life and replace it

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:16.923 align:middle line:90%
and then you will see.

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:19.293 align:middle line:84%
Tell us. Let's go into the
whole God conversation.

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:21.495 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yeah, cool, yeah, yeah.

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm-- this is
actually borrowed for--

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.466 align:middle line:84%
from one of my great
inspirations,

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:30.337 align:middle line:84%
Neale Donald Walsch because
he uses this somewhere

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.305 align:middle line:84%
in his book, in one
of his books.

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:35.942 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- yeah I was
completely struck by it

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:40.614 align:middle line:84%
because I think God is
life and life is God.

00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:44.951 align:middle line:84%
So, God is often
you know somebody,

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:47.354 align:middle line:84%
somebody as if it's
a person, you know.

00:09:47.354 --> 00:09:49.656 align:middle line:90%
I think God is energy or life.

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:54.294 align:middle line:84%
But, it's-- people are afraid
of God because God is out there

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:58.031 align:middle line:84%
and we are-- we're here and
we're separated from God.

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:01.068 align:middle line:84%
And the big lesson, if
you replace the word God

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:05.706 align:middle line:84%
by the word life is that
are you alive, Lilou?

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:06.473 align:middle line:90%
So, you're God.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:07.607 align:middle line:90%
Am I alive?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.511 align:middle line:84%
Yes I am. So, everything
that is alive is God.

00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.314 align:middle line:84%
And it changes the whole
discussion about God,

00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:16.817 align:middle line:84%
because some religions
they have a discussion

00:10:16.817 --> 00:10:20.353 align:middle line:84%
about my God is the real God
and the other one is saying no.

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:22.255 align:middle line:90%
No my God is the real God.

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.624 align:middle line:90%
Well, is there one God?

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:28.095 align:middle line:84%
You could say the universe
is one big living organism.

00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.529 align:middle line:90%
So, yes there is one God.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.731 align:middle line:90%
But, are there more gods?

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:31.832 align:middle line:90%
Is there more life?

00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:32.599 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.434 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive, also true.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.703 align:middle line:84%
It's not that one is
true and the other isn't.

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:41.341 align:middle line:84%
Often the same that two
seemingly opposite things are

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.175 align:middle line:90%
actually true.

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:44.377 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit paradox, paradoxical.

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:45.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: But, this
is-- with God you know,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.281 align:middle line:84%
is there one God or
are there more gods?

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:51.618 align:middle line:84%
If you replace the word
God by the word life it's

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:55.689 align:middle line:84%
about there is one God, one big
God, the universe, one big life

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.525 align:middle line:84%
and has many, many,
many, many little lives.

00:10:58.525 --> 00:10:59.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:00.093 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
So, it's truth.

00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:00.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Umm hmm.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.963 align:middle line:90%
And yet one brings separation.

00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:05.365 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well, I don't
think that we're separated

00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:84%
from God, because since I
am alive I'm not separated

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.504 align:middle line:84%
from life so I'm not
separated from God.

00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle line:90%
So, I just--

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:12.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: We can feel separated.

00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:13.974 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yes we can, yes.

00:11:13.974 --> 00:11:16.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Like some people are
fighting for different gods.

00:11:16.076 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
replace the word God

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.915 align:middle line:90%
by life you stop this discussion

00:11:21.915 --> 00:11:23.416 align:middle line:84%
and you can embrace
each other basically.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:25.485 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
It's no use to fight.

00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:26.186 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yep.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Black is beautiful.

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:29.623 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Black is beautiful.

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:32.959 align:middle line:90%
I'm not wearing any black today.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:90%
No I love black.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.061 align:middle line:90%
Black is beautiful is

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:38.498 align:middle line:84%
about embracing your
darker side, you know.

00:11:38.498 --> 00:11:42.936 align:middle line:84%
And a little example
is impatience.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:46.006 align:middle line:84%
Impatience, we are
only impatient--

00:11:46.006 --> 00:11:47.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:11:47.307 --> 00:11:49.176 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Because we
feel we should be patient.

00:11:49.176 --> 00:11:50.944 align:middle line:90%
And if you allow yourself

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:54.214 align:middle line:84%
to be inpatient you'll
actually become more patient.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:58.285 align:middle line:84%
So, it's-- if you
allow the darker sides,

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:01.688 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is you know and
the dark side always comes

00:12:01.688 --> 00:12:03.623 align:middle line:84%
from the opinion
we have in our mind

00:12:03.623 --> 00:12:05.025 align:middle line:90%
about something in our life.

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:08.161 align:middle line:84%
It is-- could be something from
our education and from our past,

00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:11.698 align:middle line:84%
from our families or just
made up by ourselves.

00:12:11.698 --> 00:12:18.738 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if you allow these
darker sides then they slowly

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:21.174 align:middle line:84%
disappear because you don't
have such a strong opinion

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:23.543 align:middle line:90%
about it and it's very simple.

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:27.747 align:middle line:84%
Another example is it is
this one I dropped lately.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.617 align:middle line:84%
It's all about changing
belief systems basically.

00:12:30.617 --> 00:12:32.085 align:middle line:90%
But, to be thoughtless

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.421 align:middle line:84%
in meditation I always
thought you have

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
to be thoughtless in meditation.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.991 align:middle line:90%
And if you have that point

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.126 align:middle line:84%
of view you will
never be thoughtless.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:41.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And by
allowing your thoughts

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.798 align:middle line:84%
in meditation because
it's alright, you know.

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:46.132 align:middle line:90%
It's alright to have thoughts.

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:49.369 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very useful to
have thoughts in meditation.

00:12:49.369 --> 00:12:52.973 align:middle line:90%
And by allowing them they drop.

00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:54.273 align:middle line:90%
They become less--

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:12:55.475 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And you
become more thoughtless.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.846 align:middle line:84%
And this is the whole idea
with embracing our darker side,

00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:01.848 align:middle line:84%
the things that we don't
like about ourselves.

00:13:01.848 --> 00:13:02.949 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: This
is our darker side.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But, if you allow it and
you take a bit of distance

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.589 align:middle line:84%
and you smile at
yourself, it's alright.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.258 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to disappear
afterwards.

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:12.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um--

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:12.759 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: So, some--

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: True, yeah.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.661 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:15.662 align:middle line:84%
So, some things are
really, really disappeared.

00:13:15.662 --> 00:13:18.798 align:middle line:84%
When I was young
like 14 I always used

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.433 align:middle line:90%
to use the word hate.

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:21.568 align:middle line:90%
I hate this.

00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.137 align:middle line:84%
I hate that, typical guy
in puberty, you know.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:27.774 align:middle line:84%
And now I-- this-- it is
completely out of my system.

00:13:27.774 --> 00:13:29.809 align:middle line:90%
I don't hate anymore, you know.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.913 align:middle line:84%
I only use the word hate
in an example like this.

00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.916 align:middle line:84%
So, some things really
disappear.

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:36.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Ah and transform,
transmute like the alchemist.

00:13:39.653 --> 00:13:41.488 align:middle line:84%
And you must have
loved Paulo Coelho.

00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:42.489 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: I love it.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.958 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
first books I read

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.694 align:middle line:90%
when I was starting to open up.

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.763 align:middle line:84%
And I loved it so
much because it's

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:52.198 align:middle line:84%
about everybody is
writing their own legend.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:53.533 align:middle line:90%
This is the message of the book.

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.735 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is writing
their own legend.

00:13:55.735 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So, you don't have to read
somebody else's legends.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.309 align:middle line:84%
No. You're writing
your own legend.

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:04.511 align:middle line:90%
And I completely loved it, yeah.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.779 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:06.913 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And also
with all the coincidences.

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:08.782 align:middle line:84%
And what I like about
Paulo Coelho he's one

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:11.918 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite authors
actually, that I believe

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:15.989 align:middle line:84%
that everything he writes about
the mystical world I'll call it

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:17.991 align:middle line:84%
like a guy who can
change the wind.

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is an alchemist.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.129 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everything
he writes he believes.

00:14:23.129 --> 00:14:24.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:24.264 --> 00:14:25.732 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And
this makes the dreamer

00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:90%
in me alive, you know.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.568 align:middle line:90%
And it resonates with me.

00:14:28.568 --> 00:14:29.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
I'm also a dreamer.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:30.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:31.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Van der Vliet: Imaginer.

00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:32.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:33.606 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: A
fanciest, whatever.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:34.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, I guess
some of your--

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:39.279 align:middle line:84%
the traders that you used to
work with or your family see you

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.480 align:middle line:90%
in a different way now.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean do you think
you're weird?

00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:45.385 align:middle line:84%
Do they think you're weird
because of the spiritual thing?

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:46.086 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: No.

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How do you--

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah there--

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do
you explain to them

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.558 align:middle line:84%
because I guess the book too
is to help or your message

00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in general is to really
help people to kind

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.462 align:middle line:90%
of demystify the whole thing.

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.763 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yes, definitely

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.565 align:middle line:90%
and because the title is,

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.567 align:middle line:84%
"Spiritual Awakening
the Easy Way"

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:84%
but where it's spiritual is
nowhere in the book actually.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:04.871 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: So--

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and I really didn't
think so much about it.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.074 align:middle line:90%
It just kind of happened.

00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:10.944 align:middle line:84%
But, I understand now
that I'm also here

00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:13.713 align:middle line:84%
to make this spiritual
a bit lighter

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.216 align:middle line:84%
and also the word
enlightenment--

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.385 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: A bit lighter.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.085 align:middle line:84%
People are-- there's something
so heavy about the world.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.788 align:middle line:90%
And it's just come on.

00:15:21.788 --> 00:15:25.525 align:middle line:84%
It's so-- you know let's
be a bit lighter about it.

00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:26.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Lighten up huh?

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:27.927 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Lighten up definitely.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:30.397 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
About my-- I'm growing up in
you could say the Wimbledon

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.369 align:middle line:90%
of Amsterdam.

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:38.304 align:middle line:90%
And when this book came

00:15:38.304 --> 00:15:41.273 align:middle line:84%
out first I had a
self-published version out,

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.009 align:middle line:84%
so this is about
three years ago.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:48.181 align:middle line:84%
People from that area
thought that I became crazy

00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:51.918 align:middle line:84%
because they saw the word,
that the word spiritual.

00:15:51.918 --> 00:15:54.888 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and they never read
the book, of course,

00:15:54.888 --> 00:15:58.158 align:middle line:84%
just judged the book by
its cover, that stuff.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:16:01.694 align:middle line:84%
And now they meet me and
you know you meet people

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:02.796 align:middle line:90%
in Amsterdam.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.564 align:middle line:84%
There's only one million
people living there.

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:06.599 align:middle line:84%
So, you meet everybody
just on the street.

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:08.701 align:middle line:84%
And they say, but
you didn't change.

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:09.836 align:middle line:90%
I'm like no.

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:11.204 align:middle line:90%
Why would I?

00:16:11.204 --> 00:16:14.741 align:middle line:84%
Well, because you're writing
about this spiritual stuff now.

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, so.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.579 align:middle line:84%
Well then, you must
be woo woo and fluffy

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:20.547 align:middle line:90%
and whatever you call it.

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:21.748 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:16:21.748 --> 00:16:22.882 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: I'm
like no, nothing changed.

00:16:22.882 --> 00:16:25.018 align:middle line:84%
Then I did what I liked,
trading at the market.

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:26.619 align:middle line:90%
I liked the numbers.

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.922 align:middle line:84%
You know I'm a complete
nerd actually.

00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:33.093 align:middle line:84%
And now I like what I do
so not that much changed,

00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:35.095 align:middle line:90%
but I'm now writing about it.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:37.464 align:middle line:84%
And so people have a
strong opinion about it.

00:16:37.464 --> 00:16:41.301 align:middle line:84%
But, the interesting thing is
there is this Amsterdam banking

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.902 align:middle line:90%
blog, yeah.

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:45.205 align:middle line:84%
So, it's about--
it's for traders.

00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:48.808 align:middle line:84%
And this guy that writes
about it he wrote something

00:16:48.808 --> 00:16:52.745 align:middle line:84%
about a trader goes yogi
style or something like that.

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:54.681 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I like that title.

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:55.815 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:58.084 align:middle line:84%
And something about my
book and I would expect

00:16:58.084 --> 00:17:02.021 align:middle line:84%
that all these guys would be
like, oh no, oh God how boring.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:05.492 align:middle line:84%
But, I got really interesting
remarks or comments.

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:07.092 align:middle line:84%
They're like yeah
I read the book

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.261 align:middle line:90%
and did you see his website?

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:09.361 align:middle line:90%
It's completely different.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.396 align:middle line:90%
It's no so spiritual.

00:17:10.396 --> 00:17:11.664 align:middle line:90%
It's like designed.

00:17:11.664 --> 00:17:15.502 align:middle line:84%
And so people from this
market, the financial market,

00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:17.437 align:middle line:84%
my old colleagues
they actually--

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:18.738 align:middle line:90%
they are quite open for it.

00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:19.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah

00:17:19.873 --> 00:17:21.206 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And I
think that's very cool.

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, because once
we don't add all this stuff

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:27.614 align:middle line:84%
and the woo stuff of the
special or the spiritual ego

00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:84%
or whatever there is in there
then it's just life isn't it.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.518 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:32.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It become
really simple.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.186 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And actually
quite clear.

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:35.188 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:36.556 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think also

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:42.495 align:middle line:84%
that spiritual awakening is
actually personal development

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:43.663 align:middle line:90%
plus a little bit.

00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:45.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.399 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And that plus
a little bit, this is step five

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:50.503 align:middle line:84%
in my book, is how do you
share it with your surroundings

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:52.906 align:middle line:84%
and help your surroundings
further.

00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:53.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:54.107 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: You know.

00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:54.941 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:17:54.941 --> 00:17:56.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You share your light.

00:17:56.276 --> 00:17:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, how
do you share your light yeah

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.613 align:middle line:84%
or your positive vibe or
your vibe in general, yeah.

00:18:00.613 --> 00:18:01.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:03.149 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about
the be the force

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:05.685 align:middle line:84%
because there's different
steps that you use, five steps.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.022 align:middle line:84%
Let me explain shortly
about the five steps.

00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:13.126 align:middle line:84%
So, there's five steps and these
are five steps to enlightenment,

00:18:13.126 --> 00:18:15.829 align:middle line:84%
spiritual awakening or
have more joy in life.

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:19.499 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm using these
words rather light.

00:18:19.499 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
I think the core is about how
much fun do you get out of life.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have the same
goal in life and that is to seek

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.344 align:middle line:84%
or not to seek to find your
smaller and your greater joys.

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:34.981 align:middle line:84%
But, the five steps are-- the
first two steps are actually

00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:38.585 align:middle line:84%
about rationally understanding
how your mind works, you know,

00:18:38.585 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:84%
so basically to know your
fears you could say also.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.655 align:middle line:90%
The first step is to break free.

00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle line:84%
And this breaking free can be
something like breaking free

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.627 align:middle line:90%
from a relationship or a job

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:50.496 align:middle line:84%
or you know this is a
physical breaking free.

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:55.969 align:middle line:84%
But, it's more something that if
we have an insight this is also

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:59.105 align:middle line:84%
a break free moment, a new
insight like, oh God is life.

00:18:59.105 --> 00:19:01.241 align:middle line:84%
Oh never thought
about that, you know.

00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.676 align:middle line:90%
So, this is break--

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:05.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We're breaking free
a lot during this interview.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.646 align:middle line:90%
This is good, yeah.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.614 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: I hope so.

00:19:07.614 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the break
free moment.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Then after the break free
moment comes the let go.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.555 align:middle line:90%
Step two, let go.

00:19:15.555 --> 00:19:18.291 align:middle line:84%
This is about allowing
our mind and our body

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:21.027 align:middle line:84%
to get used to the
new situation.

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:22.462 align:middle line:90%
So, for example,

00:19:22.462 --> 00:19:30.603 align:middle line:84%
if say something really
nasty-- somebody dies, yeah.

00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:33.806 align:middle line:84%
If somebody dies, I had
this a month ago here

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.541 align:middle line:90%
in England, a family member.

00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.878 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody dies and
after three days you're up

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:43.049 align:middle line:84%
and running again and you don't
cry your eyes out it's too fast,

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:46.486 align:middle line:84%
yeah because your body and your
mind they need time to get used

00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.688 align:middle line:90%
to this new situation.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So, this is-- the let
go phase is the phase

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.627 align:middle line:84%
where you do exercise for your
body, but also for your mind.

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:58.364 align:middle line:84%
This-- so this is-- exercise for
your body is to eat good food

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and to drink water and to do
yoga and sports and running

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.568 align:middle line:90%
in the park and whatever.

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
For the mind it's meditation
in the broad sense of the word.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.376 align:middle line:84%
So, these two steps
break free and let go,

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:13.313 align:middle line:84%
is about gradually understanding
how your mind works.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:17.183 align:middle line:84%
So, it can go from
your mind to the heart.

00:20:17.183 --> 00:20:18.518 align:middle line:90%
Then step three and four is

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:21.187 align:middle line:84%
about this accessing
your intuition.

00:20:21.187 --> 00:20:22.488 align:middle line:90%
Step three is to have fun.

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:25.925 align:middle line:84%
This is-- you know it's in
the middle of the five steps

00:20:25.925 --> 00:20:26.993 align:middle line:90%
because it's the core.

00:20:26.993 --> 00:20:28.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:28.962 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: As if you're
having you're having fun you're

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:90%
being spiritual.

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:32.098 align:middle line:90%
If you're having fun--

00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:33.833 align:middle line:84%
if you laugh you don't
think, for example.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:35.201 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:36.669 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: So,
this is important.

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:39.305 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not really trying to
be funny in this book I think

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:40.606 align:middle line:90%
in that part, you know.

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:42.975 align:middle line:90%
But, it's about-- for example,

00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
if you don't take yourself
too serious you zoom out more

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.549 align:middle line:84%
and you have, generally
have more fun.

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.517 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Well, this is one

00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:84%
of the things I write
in my book.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Step four is feel the force.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.491 align:middle line:84%
Feel the force is
flow, synchronicity.

00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:01.894 align:middle line:84%
Some people call it coincidence
and some people call it luck.

00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:05.832 align:middle line:84%
Yeah how do you access
the force, the flow?

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.134 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
So, that's step four.

00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:09.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, it's actually
observing it or knowing

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:11.804 align:middle line:84%
that they're there or
following that path?

00:21:11.804 --> 00:21:13.706 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:21:13.706 --> 00:21:16.676 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well, I
think that the core of being

00:21:16.676 --> 00:21:19.712 align:middle line:90%
in flow is-- I have this.

00:21:19.712 --> 00:21:22.348 align:middle line:84%
This is not in my book,
but this is in my lectures.

00:21:22.348 --> 00:21:27.553 align:middle line:84%
I have a metaphor for
life and its table tennis.

00:21:27.553 --> 00:21:31.124 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in table tennis
there is the net and we

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:33.259 align:middle line:90%
like to play over the net, yeah.

00:21:33.259 --> 00:21:37.163 align:middle line:84%
This keeps the kick and if
you play in the net its pain.

00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:38.931 align:middle line:84%
So, the joy is hitting
the ball over the net

00:21:38.931 --> 00:21:40.933 align:middle line:84%
and the pain is hitting
the ball in the net.

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:43.903 align:middle line:84%
Now, the-- we wouldn't
like table tennis,

00:21:43.903 --> 00:21:47.573 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't even exist if we
would always hit over the net.

00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So, back to life,
pain is part of life.

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:52.345 align:middle line:90%
It's part of joy.

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:54.947 align:middle line:84%
If we wouldn't know pain we
wouldn't know the experience

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:55.648 align:middle line:90%
of joy either.

00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: You know.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.819 align:middle line:84%
But, clearly we prefer
joy over pain.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:03.956 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I do. You know maybe
some people don't, but I do.

00:22:03.956 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So, what is-- the trick to go
from pain to joy and this is

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.262 align:middle line:84%
with table tennis,
but also with life.

00:22:09.262 --> 00:22:14.133 align:middle line:84%
It's not to be strategic
and think too much about it.

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:15.902 align:middle line:84%
But, it's actually
to become silent--

00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:17.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:22:17.303 --> 00:22:18.638 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And to stop
thinking and maybe say something

00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:20.106 align:middle line:90%
like come on you can do it.

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:21.207 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:22:21.207 --> 00:22:21.774 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You
know stand up again.

00:22:21.774 --> 00:22:22.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:24.277 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
And this is for me.

00:22:24.277 --> 00:22:27.113 align:middle line:90%
So, the core of being in flow is

00:22:27.113 --> 00:22:31.751 align:middle line:84%
to allow not flow
and to accept that.

00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:35.021 align:middle line:84%
To accept faith you
could say, you know.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
To accept that not
flow is also flow.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:38.925 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
It's part of the game.

00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:40.993 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: So,

00:22:40.993 --> 00:22:43.529 align:middle line:84%
if you hurt your toe you can
be grateful actually although

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.699 align:middle line:84%
you're in pain because
of this experience

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.569 align:middle line:84%
of pain you have the
experience of joy.

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:54.107 align:middle line:84%
And this is the core I think of
being in flow that if it's not

00:22:54.107 --> 00:22:57.577 align:middle line:84%
that perfect that it's
actually also perfect.

00:22:57.577 --> 00:22:58.244 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:22:58.244 --> 00:22:59.312 align:middle line:90%
So, it's acceptance?

00:22:59.312 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yes definitely, yeah.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Some people talk
about surrendering, yeah?

00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.618 align:middle line:90%
Surrendering would be good

00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:08.254 align:middle line:84%
because well there's
two parts, you know.

00:23:08.254 --> 00:23:12.925 align:middle line:84%
If you really don't like
your life path it's time

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:14.627 align:middle line:90%
for a change.

00:23:14.627 --> 00:23:16.496 align:middle line:90%
But, how do you get to this idea

00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:18.264 align:middle line:84%
that you don't like
your life path?

00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:20.299 align:middle line:84%
It's first to accept
what you're in.

00:23:20.299 --> 00:23:21.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:22.935 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: To
become quiet and then it's

00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:25.171 align:middle line:90%
like I have to get out of here.

00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:27.073 align:middle line:90%
This is-- you know so it's good

00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:29.175 align:middle line:84%
to walk away from
stuff, I think.

00:23:29.175 --> 00:23:32.278 align:middle line:84%
You know it's very important
that you can actually--

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:33.779 align:middle line:90%
you want things to change.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Van der Vliet: This is-- it
all starts with the decision

00:23:36.382 --> 00:23:38.618 align:middle line:84%
that you want to change,
because we can all complain

00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:39.952 align:middle line:90%
about things.

00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:41.521 align:middle line:84%
But, if you don't want to
change then nothing will change.

00:23:41.521 --> 00:23:42.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:23:42.355 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:90%
But, come from a quiet place.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.424 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying also.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.559 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:47.793 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Stepping back
and accepting allows us

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to really take the decisions
for the right reasons.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.031 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:53.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Not from a fear or?

00:23:53.466 --> 00:23:54.667 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Um yeah

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:56.502 align:middle line:84%
because if you become
quiet you're not in fear.

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:57.436 align:middle line:90%
You're actually in love.

00:23:57.436 --> 00:23:59.705 align:middle line:84%
So, you're-- you
see more clearly.

00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um.

00:24:00.406 --> 00:24:01.174 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:02.008 align:middle line:90%
So, but that's step four.

00:24:02.008 --> 00:24:03.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:04.243 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Then these
first four steps you can

00:24:04.243 --> 00:24:06.412 align:middle line:84%
actually see a spiritual
development.

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:09.415 align:middle line:84%
And personal development is to
find out what you like in life.

00:24:09.415 --> 00:24:11.617 align:middle line:84%
It's from the mind,
understanding your mind

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:14.921 align:middle line:84%
and your fears, going through
the heart and having fun.

00:24:14.921 --> 00:24:16.455 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so these are
the first four steps.

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.925 align:middle line:84%
So, personal development
is a big part

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:20.493 align:middle line:90%
of the awakening process.

00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:23.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The flow though starts
to go a little bit towards.

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:26.198 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, but
the thing is that people

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:28.334 align:middle line:84%
in business they
don't call it flow.

00:24:28.334 --> 00:24:29.769 align:middle line:84%
They call it sitting
on the wave.

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:32.972 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did at the market,
at the finance market.

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:35.508 align:middle line:90%
And they talk about gut feeling.

00:24:35.508 --> 00:24:36.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:37.276 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: All
businessmen do this.

00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:38.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:38.411 --> 00:24:39.612 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: They
talk about gut feeling.

00:24:39.612 --> 00:24:42.348 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same only
we use different words.

00:24:42.348 --> 00:24:43.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Van der Vliet:
And this is you know,

00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
this is where if people would
start communicating intuitively

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.654 align:middle line:90%
they would say exactly the same.

00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:49.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Umm.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:50.856 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And this
is what I see everywhere

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.825 align:middle line:84%
that people are actually
doing the same,

00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:55.661 align:middle line:84%
but they call a different and
then they get into a discussion.

00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:84%
It's only because they have
a communication problem.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:59.432 --> 00:25:00.199 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: So,
we're all doing the same.

00:25:00.199 --> 00:25:01.467 align:middle line:90%
We're all being spiritual.

00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:04.437 align:middle line:84%
We all have intuitive
minds or a heart, you know.

00:25:04.437 --> 00:25:06.639 align:middle line:84%
We're all the same
in this matter.

00:25:06.639 --> 00:25:08.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:10.243 align:middle line:84%
It's just sometimes the word
spiritual is a little bit no--

00:25:10.243 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Being conscious
is also very much a word.

00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: I think--

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.448 align:middle line:84%
yeah, spiritual,
being conscious.

00:25:15.448 --> 00:25:20.086 align:middle line:84%
And for me spirituality is
actually being intuitive

00:25:20.086 --> 00:25:21.487 align:middle line:90%
and this makes it very simple.

00:25:21.487 --> 00:25:25.324 align:middle line:84%
And this is how people say on
the more rational side of life,

00:25:25.324 --> 00:25:28.527 align:middle line:84%
the average banker here
in London, for example.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.062 align:middle line:90%
They think like oh.

00:25:30.062 --> 00:25:32.698 align:middle line:90%
But, now I understand.

00:25:32.698 --> 00:25:35.635 align:middle line:84%
So, this is spiritual,
but this is really simple.

00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:39.905 align:middle line:84%
And I do make a distinction
between spirituality

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.507 align:middle line:84%
and for example,
the mystic world.

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And the mystic world
is there after death?

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:49.281 align:middle line:84%
Is there ET life,
extraterrestrial life

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:90%
and are they here on Earth?

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:84%
How does this work with
energy, tarot cards.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.788 align:middle line:90%
You can name it, you know.

00:25:55.788 --> 00:25:58.557 align:middle line:84%
There's angels; more of them
angles than living entities

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:01.627 align:middle line:84%
in these other dimensions,
which you could call angels.

00:26:01.627 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's
extremely interesting.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:06.065 align:middle line:90%
And I know for the rest

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.769 align:middle line:84%
of my life I will study the
mystical world, but it has--

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:13.305 align:middle line:84%
this is-- has nothing to
do with living intuitively.

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It can help you.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But, living intuitively
is an inside process.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.312 align:middle line:84%
And the mystical world
is seeking guidance

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:22.715 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world actually.

00:26:22.715 --> 00:26:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So, we don't-- really don't
have to know about how this,

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff works although
it's very interesting.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.158 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to know about that

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:36.362 align:middle line:84%
to become intuitively more
intelligent you could say.

00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:37.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:26:37.463 --> 00:26:38.497 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: This
is an inside process

00:26:38.497 --> 00:26:40.866 align:middle line:84%
for every person,
for him or herself--

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:41.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:42.702 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: To do.

00:26:42.702 --> 00:26:44.937 align:middle line:84%
So, this is the personal
development basically.

00:26:44.937 --> 00:26:48.574 align:middle line:84%
You know how do I
understand how my mind works?

00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:54.213 align:middle line:84%
Where are my fears so I can
go to live more from the heart

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:56.615 align:middle line:90%
and live more intuitively?

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.251 align:middle line:84%
I think this creates more
longer term happiness

00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:01.687 align:middle line:84%
than a decision purely
based on the mind--

00:27:01.687 --> 00:27:02.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:03.723 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
And what we learned.

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So, these are the
first four steps.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:05.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We become
like kids too.

00:27:05.658 --> 00:27:06.358 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry--

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.159 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:07.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Release the kids.

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:09.028 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:09.729 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Not going
to the fifth step.

00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:10.863 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:27:10.863 --> 00:27:11.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But, I'm
excited about the fourth.

00:27:11.697 --> 00:27:13.099 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: This is just like--
it's just like being kids too,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.204 align:middle line:84%
you know becoming-- I love how
your kids, you speak of kids.

00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:20.239 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
I have four kids.

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:21.640 align:middle line:90%
I just told you.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.912 align:middle line:84%
So, I have three older kids, 14,
12 and 10 and they're together

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:28.781 align:middle line:90%
in their puberty years.

00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I have one, one
and half year old.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And my kids are my
greatest teachers.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.389 align:middle line:84%
You know and the youngest,
he's a one and a half year old.

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:40.326 align:middle line:90%
I will show you pictures later.

00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:42.495 align:middle line:90%
He gives unconditional love.

00:27:42.495 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:84%
He gives it, but he also makes
you give unconditional love.

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:47.166 align:middle line:84%
You learn to love
unconditionally

00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:48.901 align:middle line:90%
from your children.

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:52.638 align:middle line:84%
And my older kids the
three of them they--

00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:55.141 align:middle line:84%
I teach my kids you know
you have your own way

00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:56.976 align:middle line:90%
from when they are two.

00:27:56.976 --> 00:28:00.179 align:middle line:84%
You know so this is
basically their daily mantra.

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:03.749 align:middle line:84%
So, this means that they have a
big mouth against their father

00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:06.652 align:middle line:84%
in a nice way, sometimes
also not so nice, by the way.

00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:10.489 align:middle line:84%
But, so my older kids learn
me how to lose my ego--

00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:11.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:13.826 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Because
I-- they have their own path.

00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:16.529 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, but what
I really learn

00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:20.166 align:middle line:84%
from kids especially the
younger they are the more this

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:24.370 align:middle line:84%
expressing is-- a child
doesn't have any rules.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.738 align:middle line:90%
It's purely intuitive.

00:28:25.738 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:90%
If it's sad it's crying.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And one minute later it's
out and he's laughing again.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.814 align:middle line:84%
And if it wants help
it asks for help.

00:28:34.814 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they want to give
help they are giving help.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.686 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we can
really, really, really learn

00:28:40.686 --> 00:28:43.489 align:middle line:84%
from as an adult because
we have all kind of rules.

00:28:43.489 --> 00:28:44.623 align:middle line:90%
Oh I shouldn't cry--

00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:45.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:28:45.925 --> 00:28:46.492 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You know
because crying is not cool.

00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:47.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:28:47.593 --> 00:28:48.227 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: I
think crying is cool.

00:28:48.227 --> 00:28:49.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:28:49.528 --> 00:28:50.696 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You know
I cried this morning, yeah.

00:28:50.696 --> 00:28:53.599 align:middle line:84%
And so its-- this is
what you can really learn

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.368 align:middle line:84%
from children is basically
to express ourselves

00:28:56.368 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
to show how we feel, because
if we don't it stays somewhere

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:01.941 align:middle line:90%
in your system.

00:29:01.941 --> 00:29:03.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:29:03.309 --> 00:29:05.644 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And I had
this a few weeks ago at yoga.

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:07.246 align:middle line:90%
I was doing yoga with a friend.

00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:08.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You practice yoga?

00:29:08.314 --> 00:29:09.448 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yes, yes, a lot, yes.

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:10.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: A lot of
people on Gaaim love yoga

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:11.083 align:middle line:90%
because there's all those--

00:29:11.083 --> 00:29:12.284 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Oh I love it.

00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:13.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yoga videos too
and all those teachings.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.888 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: I do,
I do yoga every morning.

00:29:15.888 --> 00:29:18.958 align:middle line:84%
Every morning I do the five
Tibetan rights 21 times.

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:19.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh yeah.

00:29:19.725 --> 00:29:20.559 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: And so--

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Those are great, yeah.

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Those
are-- it's pure energy.

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:24.029 align:middle line:84%
You know you don't need a
double latte if you do the--

00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:26.565 align:middle line:90%
if you do yoga in the morning.

00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:29.001 align:middle line:90%
And I meditate also every day.

00:29:29.001 --> 00:29:31.837 align:middle line:90%
But-- and so I love yoga.

00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:35.407 align:middle line:84%
I love yoga and I was doing yoga
with a friend of mine and I had

00:29:35.407 --> 00:29:37.977 align:middle line:84%
to laugh like really
like ha, ha, ha.

00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:39.111 align:middle line:90%
But, I kept it in--

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:42.147 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Because the
teacher was looking at me like,

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:90%
you know so I kept it in.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.186 align:middle line:84%
And 10 minutes later I
couldn't do anything anymore

00:29:47.186 --> 00:29:50.456 align:middle line:84%
and I just had to lie down, why,
because I didn't express myself,

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.091 align:middle line:90%
because I was being decent--

00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:53.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:29:53.025 --> 00:29:53.592 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
To the teacher--

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:54.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:29:54.894 --> 00:29:55.461 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Because
he was looking angry at me.

00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:56.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:29:56.862 --> 00:29:57.997 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And I thought
like, well okay, no, no, no, no.

00:29:57.997 --> 00:30:00.332 align:middle line:84%
I can't start laughing
because I really felt

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:02.001 align:middle line:90%
like laughing and I didn't.

00:30:02.001 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So, that time I didn't
behave like a kid

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.305 align:middle line:90%
and my energy dropped.

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.706 align:middle line:90%
And this is something,

00:30:07.706 --> 00:30:12.645 align:middle line:84%
if we express ourselves you know
your energy is flowing very much

00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:14.813 align:middle line:90%
and your energy's very high.

00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.649 align:middle line:84%
And this is the big
lesson we can learn

00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:18.317 align:middle line:90%
from our children, yeah.

00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:19.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm, mmm.

00:30:19.018 --> 00:30:19.785 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:20.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: The fifth step.

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:22.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Van der Vliet:
The fifth step.

00:30:22.087 --> 00:30:23.589 align:middle line:84%
So, the first four steps is
from the mind through the heart

00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and to access intuition.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.459 align:middle line:90%
And then the fifth step is--

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I called it move
towards the light.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:35.334 align:middle line:84%
And this is about how do
you share your positive vibe

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:37.202 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the world.

00:30:37.202 --> 00:30:39.371 align:middle line:84%
And here comes also
the idea that we're--

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:41.774 align:middle line:84%
basically we're always
forming a collective.

00:30:41.774 --> 00:30:45.911 align:middle line:84%
You just said it that
you are you and I am me.

00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:48.981 align:middle line:84%
We are in a way separate
entities.

00:30:48.981 --> 00:30:52.685 align:middle line:84%
I know we're all one you know,
but we're also separate entities

00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:56.422 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that you eat
your food and I eat my food.

00:30:56.422 --> 00:30:59.625 align:middle line:84%
You know I can't eat
your food for example.

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:03.696 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to take care
for ourselves, eat healthy,

00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:05.798 align:middle line:90%
do yoga every day or whatever.

00:31:05.798 --> 00:31:10.336 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this is a
must, but it works for me.

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:14.573 align:middle line:84%
So-- and on the other hand
we're always part of a group.

00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:15.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:16.742 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Always.

00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:20.212 align:middle line:84%
We are forming a group now and
with a lot of other people also.

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:23.949 align:middle line:84%
And in the end humanity
is a group

00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:26.318 align:middle line:90%
or Earth or even the universe.

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:30.889 align:middle line:84%
So, we're-- at the same time
you're being an individual and

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:34.159 align:middle line:84%
or an entity and you're
part of a collective.

00:31:34.159 --> 00:31:35.427 align:middle line:90%
So, you're being a collective.

00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:37.463 align:middle line:84%
This is also again
such a paradox

00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:40.833 align:middle line:90%
that you're both an individual

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:42.968 align:middle line:84%
and a collective
at the same time.

00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:45.871 align:middle line:84%
And a very simple example and
this is also not in my book,

00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:49.742 align:middle line:84%
but-- because my book is
more like short insights

00:31:49.742 --> 00:31:51.677 align:middle line:90%
and short snippets of text.

00:31:51.677 --> 00:31:54.413 align:middle line:84%
But, an example is
a football team.

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:57.182 align:middle line:84%
I think football's
very spiritual.

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:58.384 align:middle line:90%
I don't watch football.

00:31:58.384 --> 00:32:00.419 align:middle line:84%
I really don't care for
football, but this idea

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:02.955 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to tell you
I think it's spiritual.

00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:05.391 align:middle line:84%
So, in the United States you
call this soccer by the way,

00:32:05.391 --> 00:32:07.793 align:middle line:84%
but it goes for American
football too.

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:11.663 align:middle line:84%
It is the idea that
every player is an entity

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:16.201 align:middle line:84%
and is optimizing his own
ability to play football.

00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:20.973 align:middle line:84%
But, if these players don't play
together, there's no team player

00:32:20.973 --> 00:32:24.076 align:middle line:84%
in every person,
that will never win.

00:32:24.076 --> 00:32:25.477 align:middle line:90%
It's about playing together.

00:32:25.477 --> 00:32:26.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And this
is, I think, this is my idea.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.418 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're really good
in playing together in the world

00:32:32.418 --> 00:32:35.621 align:middle line:84%
and that competition
is actually an illusion

00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:38.323 align:middle line:84%
and that playing together is
what we're really good at.

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:42.828 align:middle line:84%
And you see this in sports even
though one team is battling

00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:44.163 align:middle line:90%
against the other team.

00:32:44.163 --> 00:32:47.366 align:middle line:84%
It's because they work so
good together, the team player

00:32:47.366 --> 00:32:50.402 align:middle line:84%
in every individual
player is developed.

00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:52.504 align:middle line:90%
This is why they win a match.

00:32:52.504 --> 00:32:53.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:55.607 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: So, this
is what we're really good at.

00:32:55.607 --> 00:32:56.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:32:56.842 --> 00:32:58.377 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: It's
playing or working together.

00:32:58.377 --> 00:32:59.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:01.613 align:middle line:84%
So, sharing your light, why did
you call it sharing our light?

00:33:01.613 --> 00:33:03.782 align:middle line:90%
What's the light part?

00:33:03.782 --> 00:33:07.753 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: The light
part is the part where you see

00:33:07.753 --> 00:33:13.992 align:middle line:84%
that fears are-- they're very
human, but also quite useless.

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:16.361 align:middle line:90%
And they're-- actually

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:21.467 align:middle line:84%
if you take enough steps back
it's kind of an illusion.

00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:22.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:25.671 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And if you
notice then you start to unwind,

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:29.074 align:middle line:84%
let go of your fears and
here's where meditation

00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:30.843 align:middle line:90%
and yoga really, really helps.

00:33:30.843 --> 00:33:36.682 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a
different path comes out

00:33:36.682 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and for me this is
writing books now.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.187 align:middle line:84%
But, I-- you know
I started writing

00:33:42.187 --> 00:33:45.591 align:middle line:84%
about five years
ago out of the blue.

00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:46.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:50.996 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: So, it's the
more open you are the more your

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:53.599 align:middle line:90%
energy flows and the more,

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:56.468 align:middle line:84%
light and literally
lighter you become.

00:33:56.468 --> 00:34:00.606 align:middle line:84%
And this shows automatically
in your surrounds.

00:34:00.606 --> 00:34:04.309 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, going back to
the kids, if a child is playing

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:10.215 align:middle line:84%
and having fun then it's
lightening up his or her world.

00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:11.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:12.985 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You know
these five adults staring

00:34:12.985 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:90%
at this baby.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.954 align:middle line:84%
I call this the babies
stare meditation.

00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:21.793 align:middle line:84%
And then after a minute
I, oh, oh, ha, oh,

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
it's such a beautiful
boy, you know.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.133 align:middle line:84%
This is what a child does in
lighting their surroundings

00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:30.836 align:middle line:84%
by generally doing what
they like, playing.

00:34:30.836 --> 00:34:31.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:33.037 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
And this is what--

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:35.374 align:middle line:84%
the more delighted you
become the more you become

00:34:35.374 --> 00:34:38.843 align:middle line:84%
like a child, the more
you're going to play.

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:42.613 align:middle line:84%
And you're basically
enlightening your surroundings.

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:43.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:44.583 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
You know it's--

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:45.984 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's not
so much what it is.

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:48.653 align:middle line:84%
It's more the way that
we're sharing our light,

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:53.525 align:middle line:84%
our lightness, our
soul expression or?

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:54.827 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

00:34:54.827 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What do
you think is light?

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.766 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Well, in
a scientific way this is--

00:35:00.766 --> 00:35:05.871 align:middle line:84%
I think this is very interesting
that if you break down matter

00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:10.676 align:middle line:84%
into the smallest part, parts,
so this is quantum physics.

00:35:10.676 --> 00:35:15.814 align:middle line:84%
Most of it or I think all of it,
maybe I'm slightly wrong here,

00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:18.684 align:middle line:90%
but it comes down to photons.

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:22.421 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
actually made of light.

00:35:22.421 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
It's so bizarre and
this is science.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:25.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Umm hmm.

00:35:25.924 --> 00:35:27.793 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You know
because I love to be mystical

00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:32.164 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes woo that we're
all light and shine your light.

00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But, we're actually
made of light

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.435 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific
form, you know.

00:35:36.435 --> 00:35:38.403 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
very interesting.

00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:41.807 align:middle line:84%
But, I think if-- we're all in
a way, we're stars, you know

00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:44.243 align:middle line:84%
and especially our heart
energy is very strong

00:35:44.243 --> 00:35:45.444 align:middle line:90%
and if you do what you

00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:49.047 align:middle line:84%
like you're literally,
literally radiating.

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:52.351 align:middle line:84%
So, people might not see
it, but they do feel it.

00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:53.719 align:middle line:90%
And this is where you get--

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:55.621 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you have this too that
you're walking on the street

00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:58.724 align:middle line:84%
and this three year old
child is just staring at you.

00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:00.425 align:middle line:90%
You have that too, right?

00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. This is probably because
she just had some really nice

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.199 align:middle line:84%
thought or you're being
happy for nothing,

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.735 align:middle line:90%
you know also works very good.

00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:13.405 align:middle line:84%
And then people notice
especially children.

00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:90%
They notice.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.309 align:middle line:84%
And you start also looking
people in the eye and smiling

00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:18.443 align:middle line:90%
to people in the street.

00:36:18.443 --> 00:36:19.678 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:20.979 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: I do
this my whole life actually

00:36:20.979 --> 00:36:22.714 align:middle line:90%
and people are amazed by that.

00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:25.751 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to lighten
up somebody's day

00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:27.319 align:middle line:84%
by just looking somebody
in the eye

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:29.154 align:middle line:90%
and smiling at them, you know.

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:33.392 align:middle line:84%
And if we would all do
that you have this world.

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:35.093 align:middle line:84%
I already think it's
a beautiful world,

00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:37.562 align:middle line:90%
but will be even more beautiful.

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:38.897 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:40.666 align:middle line:84%
I love because we're discussing
of all of those big topic

00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:41.967 align:middle line:90%
with so much lightness.

00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:44.503 align:middle line:84%
And you know it really
feels good.

00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:46.805 align:middle line:84%
I have another pretty
heavy usually question,

00:36:46.805 --> 00:36:49.241 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure you're going
to bring light to it.

00:36:49.241 --> 00:36:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Truths, what is true?

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.513 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Ooh,
ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah.

00:36:54.513 --> 00:36:59.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
truth is about knowing

00:36:59.685 --> 00:37:03.088 align:middle line:84%
and about being right,
which is from our mind.

00:37:03.088 --> 00:37:06.191 align:middle line:84%
My general idea is
that you don't have

00:37:06.191 --> 00:37:09.528 align:middle line:84%
to believe everything
your mind produces.

00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:13.665 align:middle line:84%
And if you do life becomes,
life becomes a lighter.

00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Truth is a personal thing.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.969 align:middle line:84%
And so for me I do this
yoga every morning.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.071 align:middle line:90%
This is my truth.

00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:21.173 align:middle line:90%
It works for me.

00:37:21.173 --> 00:37:26.578 align:middle line:84%
And so it works for me, but
truth is a personal thing.

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:90%
So, it's not something that--

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:34.753 align:middle line:84%
I cannot force my truths up onto
you I think you say in English.

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:37.989 align:middle line:84%
And because there's my truth
and there's your truth.

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.225 align:middle line:84%
And so truth basically
doesn't exist.

00:37:40.225 --> 00:37:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.961 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Truth is
what the average idiot thinks--

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:44.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Um hmm.

00:37:44.029 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Or
believes to be true.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.935 align:middle line:84%
And so basically this is blue,
but if 51 percent of the people

00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:53.638 align:middle line:84%
in the world would say no,
this is green I would be wrong.

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:54.639 align:middle line:90%
So, truth is relative.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.742 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:90%
And then on the other hand

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.811 align:middle line:84%
and so everybody has
their personal truth.

00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:00.812 align:middle line:90%
Truth doesn't exist.

00:38:00.812 --> 00:38:02.581 align:middle line:90%
This is my point of view.

00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:07.352 align:middle line:84%
And then some, somebody could
say it's more philosophical.

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:11.523 align:middle line:84%
But-- well love is the truth,
you know and fear isn't.

00:38:11.523 --> 00:38:13.959 align:middle line:84%
Yeah in the philosophical
way I could say okay,

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:16.828 align:middle line:84%
okay if there is a higher
truth then you could say

00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:19.531 align:middle line:90%
that love is the higher truth.

00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:20.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:21.967 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: You
know because this is--

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:25.370 align:middle line:84%
when I have a problem with
something or a challenge I--

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.141 align:middle line:84%
often I'll ask myself
okay what is my problem

00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:31.109 align:middle line:90%
and what would love decide.

00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:35.447 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes your love
decision is quite tough

00:38:35.447 --> 00:38:36.348 align:middle line:90%
for other people--

00:38:36.348 --> 00:38:37.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.618 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Because
you're being straight basically.

00:38:39.618 --> 00:38:40.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:41.386 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: If you start--

00:38:41.386 --> 00:38:42.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Big noes
oh is from love.

00:38:42.487 --> 00:38:43.588 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:38:43.588 --> 00:38:45.757 align:middle line:84%
I think to say no is
very, very spiritual--

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:46.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:47.726 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Because a lot

00:38:47.726 --> 00:38:49.394 align:middle line:84%
of people will become
spiritual they say like,

00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:51.329 align:middle line:90%
oh yes, oh yes only yes.

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:52.531 align:middle line:90%
You know they never say no.

00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:53.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:53.331 --> 00:38:53.899 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: I say no.

00:38:53.899 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:55.634 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: No.

00:38:55.634 --> 00:38:56.535 align:middle line:84%
This is not my game,
sorry, stop here.

00:38:56.535 --> 00:38:57.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm, yeah.

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah me too and I felt the
biggest growth step in harmony

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.142 align:middle line:84%
with my really-- my
truth or aligned with--

00:39:04.142 --> 00:39:05.143 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah.

00:39:05.143 --> 00:39:06.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: My soul
was the big noes.

00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: Yeah, yeah
because you have your truth.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.484 align:middle line:84%
This-- actually the only
responsibility we have is

00:39:12.484 --> 00:39:16.455 align:middle line:84%
to live our life for our
own happiness basically.

00:39:16.455 --> 00:39:19.491 align:middle line:84%
And this is also what you
show in life, you know.

00:39:19.491 --> 00:39:21.026 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you say.

00:39:21.026 --> 00:39:24.429 align:middle line:84%
It's what you show because
writing a book is cool.

00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:28.633 align:middle line:84%
But, this is not-- you know
it's a cool book and I love it

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:31.136 align:middle line:90%
and it really sells good.

00:39:31.136 --> 00:39:34.639 align:middle line:84%
But, it's actually-- it's
not about writing this book.

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:37.476 align:middle line:84%
It's about showing
what I do in my life,

00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:38.777 align:middle line:90%
you know, my daily life.

00:39:38.777 --> 00:39:42.347 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- I'm actually
better offline than online,

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:45.917 align:middle line:84%
I think you know by standing
at the bus station and talking

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:49.287 align:middle line:84%
to this older woman and you know
I'm really getting that part

00:39:49.287 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:84%
of playing with my kids or
drinking coffee with a friend

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.659 align:middle line:84%
of mine in the morning,
you know.

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.696 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm really good
at, just talking to people.

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:39:58.497 --> 00:39:59.531 align:middle line:90%
>> van der Vliet: And that--

00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:02.567 align:middle line:84%
you could see that
as walking the walk

00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:04.803 align:middle line:90%
and writing and giving lectures.

00:40:04.803 --> 00:40:07.739 align:middle line:84%
I love to do it, but
it's talking the talk.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:13.044 align:middle line:84%
And it is eventually about what
do you-- what you show in life.

00:40:13.044 --> 00:40:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that Gandhi said
something like that.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.982 align:middle line:84%
What's your message
Gandhi and he said,

00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:18.517 align:middle line:90%
"My life is my message."

00:40:18.517 --> 00:40:19.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:20.652 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: I think
that's really nice, well put,

00:40:20.652 --> 00:40:22.287 align:middle line:90%
yeah, big inspiration also.

00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:23.688 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:40:23.688 --> 00:40:26.791 align:middle line:84%
So, when you choose to do some
project or work with somebody,

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:30.495 align:middle line:90%
how do you chose that?

00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
I don't choose.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:34.799 align:middle line:84%
First of all I only work
with people that I like.

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:37.168 align:middle line:84%
I have a higher connection
or am higher with.

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:43.208 align:middle line:84%
And so, but everybody I
work with just passes by.

00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:46.912 align:middle line:84%
So, I was just saying about this
friend I'm drinking coffee with.

00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:50.815 align:middle line:84%
We meet each other three times
a week and we're both busy,

00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:52.584 align:middle line:84%
but we have our silent
moment together.

00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:53.752 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we don't speak.

00:40:53.752 --> 00:40:56.188 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we do speak.

00:40:56.188 --> 00:41:01.493 align:middle line:84%
And he's real-- he's--
at Nike, he's a big designer.

00:41:01.493 --> 00:41:05.096 align:middle line:84%
He designs, the new
shop in Rome,

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.132 align:middle line:90%
for example, he designed that.

00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:12.537 align:middle line:84%
And I was making a website
and I thought I was going

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.339 align:middle line:90%
to do the design myself.

00:41:14.339 --> 00:41:17.509 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know
what, I can do your design.

00:41:17.509 --> 00:41:18.777 align:middle line:90%
I went, really.

00:41:18.777 --> 00:41:20.245 align:middle line:90%
But, aren't you too busy?

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:21.112 align:middle line:90%
No and it's alright.

00:41:21.112 --> 00:41:22.213 align:middle line:90%
I like to do this.

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.349 align:middle line:84%
You know we have such
a great time always.

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.551 align:middle line:84%
And this is how I meet
the people I work with.

00:41:26.551 --> 00:41:30.021 align:middle line:84%
It's only because you
know because I like them.

00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:33.291 align:middle line:84%
And also with Hayhouse
it's, you know it's so cool

00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.261 align:middle line:84%
that I have this
deal with Hayhouse.

00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.664 align:middle line:84%
But, when I was going
there I started meditating.

00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.866 align:middle line:84%
I immediately felt
my crowd, you know.

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.335 align:middle line:90%
So, it felt good.

00:41:43.335 --> 00:41:44.803 align:middle line:90%
But, I wasn't sure.

00:41:44.803 --> 00:41:47.272 align:middle line:84%
You know I wasn't going to
say yes just immediately.

00:41:47.272 --> 00:41:48.306 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to feel them.

00:41:48.306 --> 00:41:49.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:50.875 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And
they're exactly the same.

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:55.347 align:middle line:84%
And they felt that I
was part of their family

00:41:55.347 --> 00:41:59.184 align:middle line:84%
and I felt exactly the same
and this is how I feel now.

00:41:59.184 --> 00:42:03.655 align:middle line:84%
But, the deal can
be you know so good,

00:42:03.655 --> 00:42:05.857 align:middle line:84%
but if it doesn't feel
good I can't do it.

00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:08.827 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm really trusting,
trusting the gut.

00:42:08.827 --> 00:42:10.028 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:10.795 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: As
people in business would say

00:42:10.795 --> 00:42:11.496 align:middle line:90%
or trusting my intuition.

00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:12.497 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:13.064 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Trusting my heart.

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:14.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:14.899 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And this
is how I work with people.

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.134 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mmm.

00:42:16.134 --> 00:42:17.802 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet: And I
work with quite a few people

00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:21.206 align:middle line:84%
and it's only because
I like them.

00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:22.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:42:22.407 --> 00:42:23.675 align:middle line:84%
Is there something else
that you would like to add

00:42:23.675 --> 00:42:26.411 align:middle line:84%
to this delicious
conversation to kind

00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:28.747 align:middle line:84%
of end our beautiful
time together here?

00:42:28.747 --> 00:42:31.516 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect that we might
have not talked about or?

00:42:31.516 --> 00:42:32.717 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
Well, the thing is

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:35.153 align:middle line:84%
with this book what people
often do is they use it

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:36.354 align:middle line:90%
as tarot cards.

00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:39.291 align:middle line:84%
So, in the morning you
had to take a deep breath

00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:41.059 align:middle line:84%
and they open the
book somewhere.

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:42.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh yeah.

00:42:42.127 --> 00:42:42.694 align:middle line:84%
>> van der Vliet:
So, shall we do that?

00:42:42.694 --> 00:42:43.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:42:43.528 --> 00:42:44.295 align:middle line:90%

00:42:54.339 --> 00:42:56.074 align:middle line:90%
Well it's this one.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:03.648 align:middle line:84%
It says basically it's
time to give-- the, the--

00:43:03.648 --> 00:43:06.251 align:middle line:84%
it's time for-- this is really
difficult for me in English.

00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:12.891 align:middle line:84%
We have the patriarchy and
so the man is the boss.

time to turn this around.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.563 align:middle line:84%
You know we did for thousands
of years and now it's time

00:43:18.563 --> 00:43:23.568 align:middle line:84%
to give the women the key and
it's time for the matriarchy.
