00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Florida, delicious
Florida, sunny and warm.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely lovely to
come here in early spring

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:84%
when the rest of the
world is quite cold.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Brian,
Dr. Brian Clement,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
for accepting this
interview here

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.557 align:middle line:84%
at the Hippocrates
Health Institute.

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that how we say it?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.485 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. BRIAN CLEMENT: Yes.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates Health
Institute, after the father

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:90%
of Western medicine.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very excited to have
this conversation on raw food,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
on your recommendation, on
what's really going on here.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
This is well known
all the way in Europe.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.520 align:middle line:10%
All around the world, we
speak about this place

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:10%
that was founded by Ann Wigmore.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.680 align:middle line:10%
Is that right?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.471 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Correct.

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:10%
Ann Wigmore, back
in 1952, was told

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:10%
by the top doctors in
America at Harvard in Boston

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:10%
she had three months to live.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:10%
She had colon cancer.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Now the good news is she
was a European peasant who

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.300 align:middle line:10%
had immigrated to North America
as many Europeans and people

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
from around the globe have.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And she literally had a grandmom
that was a village doctor.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And remember, doctors
100 years ago and before,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:90%
were all natural doctors.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
There were no
pharmaceutical medicines

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%
and no fancy modern technology.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It was just herbs,
and love, and food.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And she watched grandmom
mend people back

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
from war torn Lithuania,
and learned all of that,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and then employed
it when she thought

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
she had no other options,
and healed herself

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:90%
of stage-4 cancer.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Now in Boston,
Massachusetts, it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.937 align:middle line:84%
the academic capital
of the United States

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and one of the world, of course.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So the top medical hospitals
and educational institutes

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
are there.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And she, in fact, stood up
in the middle of the 1950s--

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.134 align:middle line:84%
about 60 years
ago-- and said, you

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have to listen
to those people who

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
are well-trained
and well-educated.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
That you can heal
yourself in spite of it.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was a revolution in
consciousness, as we say.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: And you found out.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the moment you
found out about her book,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Be Your Own Doctor.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.398 align:middle line:84%
And you were living in
a total different state.

00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you move quite
a lot around, eh?

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden
this book made you-- it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.639 align:middle line:10%
changed your life.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Well,
what happened to me,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:10%
I was a pioneer in
American obesity.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I was a giant, fat guy,
the kind that in Europe you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
would look at.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
Hawaiian shirt,

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.252 align:middle line:90%
but I had everything else.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: How big?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.876 align:middle line:90%
>>CLEMENT: Pretty big.

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I was 120 pounds more than I
am now and smoking cigarettes.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I, when I was growing
up, in my generation--

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:84%
we call it the Clint Eastwood
and the John Wayne generation--

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
was literally taught formally
that your masculinity

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and your malehood depended
upon consumption of meat.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So we consumed massive
amounts of meat in those days.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was sort of
a trend worldwide.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:90%
And it showed affluence.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:90%
And it showed everything else.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.619 align:middle line:84%
And when I met a guy
that was a vegetarian,

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was strange.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
mean, vegetarian?

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the odd thing is he was
my girlfriend's boyfriend's--

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
girlfriend's best
friend's boyfriend.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:90%
He was 30, and I was 20.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And he was doing yoga.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I never heard of yoga.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I came from New York.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Twisting his body.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And when he wasn't around
I'd say to my girlfriend,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
listen, why don't we
try some of that food?

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it,
there was a sense about it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
where I just felt good.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if it was
going to help me lose weight.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't really my ambition.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:90%
My ambition was to change.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:90%
And boy, did I change.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And within a matter of months,
adapted a full vegan diet.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:90%
This is 42 years ago.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And basically said,
at that point,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I have to learn about this.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I was studying at that
point anatomy and biochemistry

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and really enthralled with
the human body and how

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:90%
it functioned.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And started to realize that
there was an ever-growing group

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of people that were going
against the mainstream

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much using
diet to heal themselves.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.575 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't a new activity.

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It was traditional medicine.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we were all
being told by the powers

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
that be that there was only
one way, and that all of that

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
was folk medicine, and it was
passe, and don't look at it.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And the truth was
I would meet one

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
after another, people who
had reversed diseases.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
The amazing thing for me,
back then in health stores,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.044 align:middle line:84%
they were all run by people
who had those experiences.

00:04:33.044 --> 00:04:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I would go from health
store to health stores.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I travelled the United
States and then the globe.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And each of those
people uniquely

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
had a nice story, how
their arthritis went away,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
or their multiple sclerosis,
or mental illness,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or how they were obese
and had healed themselves.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I recall reading a
book called Be Your Own Doctor.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And I said, my gosh.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:90%
That was an interesting title.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was about Ann,
and Ann's recovery,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and how simple it
was to eat raw food.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Now I wasn't eating raw food.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I was just precluding,
eliminating dairy food

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:90%
and meat.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea of growing
food in your own house

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
even in a cold
climate in the middle

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of winter in your
kitchen window,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.684 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the nutrition,
of the common sense approach

00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
where it said, you know,
when you cook things,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:84%
you lose most of the
nutrients, all of that

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:90%
just resonated with me.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.465 align:middle line:84%
And I, one summer,
gravitated it was very hot

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
where I was living on the west
coast of the United States

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840 align:middle line:90%
in Oregon.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was 100
degrees every day.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.265 align:middle line:84%
I just gravitated to 100%
raw food, plant-based diet.

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: On your own?

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.775 align:middle line:84%
Following the
guidance of this book?

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLEMENT: Yes.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually around
the time I read the book.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:10%
So partially, I
slipped into this,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:10%
and then adopted the book,
and used it as a guide.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I moved
back to the East Coast.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I was about ready, in Oregon,
create a health center

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:90%
on the Oregon coast.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It would be a natural health
center and dealing with food,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of exercise, movement,
hiking, and nature walks,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and evolution in consciousness,
and awareness, and building

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:84%
people's confidence
in who they are.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.442 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my then
wife, why don't we

00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:90%
move to the East Coast.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:90%
You've never lived there.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:90%
She picked Maine.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was coming off a very
long fast, a 52-day fast.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, let's go
down and visit Hippocrates.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And met Ann Wigmore.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me
to join the staff.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a cosmic
event in my life.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.589 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one that hears
voices, but I did that night.

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It basically said,
you have to do it.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I had no intent in
the world to live

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.095 align:middle line:84%
in a cold,
northeastern, dark city.

00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: How big was
the campus at that time?

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.178 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: It was very small.

00:06:43.178 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:10%
It was a very large
brownstone in downtown Boston.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And during my time there,
I joined the staff in 1975,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:84%
went to Europe for 3
and 1/2 years bringing

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
the message of raw food
back to the continent it

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
came from in recent times.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kristine Nolfi
in Denmark literally

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.010 align:middle line:84%
started the living food movement
there after healing cancer

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
herself, breast cancer,
back in the early part

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.286 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege
to direct that,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and in Geneve,
Switzerland helped

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schaller create
Foundation Soleil.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I was interviewing
him on Gaiam TV last week

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:10%
in Switzerland.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Oh yeah.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:10%
He's a good friend of mine.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:10%
He's a good buddy of mine.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
A terrific human being.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
And so he and I worked together.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:84%
We were both very
young men and developed

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.211 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary center there
on consciousness, and diet, et

00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're linked, that
you cannot be conscious without

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.414 align:middle line:90%
diet being part of it.

00:07:34.414 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the problems
I see in the consciousness

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
movement, that people think
you can think everything away.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.570 align:middle line:84%
No, you've got to
actually proceed.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
You've got to literally
act in your own integrity

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and do the things that
allow your energetic field,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
your brain, your
consciousness to grow.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you're consuming
animal-based foods,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.179 align:middle line:90%
that's going to hold you back.

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:53.160 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.159 align:middle line:84%
But going back to
it, I was in Europe

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
for 3 and 1/2 years, came
back, and they asked me

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:90%
to direct Hippocrates in 1980.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed the directorship,
now 3 and 1/2 decades ago,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
and have never looked back.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was my ambition,
at that point,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to see where the most
appropriate place would

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:90%
be to house Hippocrates.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And we had our board of
directors come together

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the alumnus of
Hippocrates, our graduates.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And we started to look all over
in North America and the world

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:90%
to see where we'd relocate.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And we finally got down between
Santa Barbara in California

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and here in West Palm Beach,
and chose West Palm Beach.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And happily, have done that.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a lot of
people who come from Europe,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Now from Asia, from China,
from all over the world.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:10%
But it has been a great place
to be because the weather here

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:10%
is terrific.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: 55 acres in California
might cost a little bit more,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:10%
too, than in Florida.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Yes, it does.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:10%
It costs a little bit more.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:10%
That's for sure.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And the weather's
not quite as warm.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not as
convenient for people

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to make these incredible
transformations.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I have many,
many questions regarding

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:10%
the food itself and
what you recommend.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:10%
And I hear sprouts
here is a very big.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:10%
I went into his room
where there's all those--

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:10%
how many tons of sprouts
are being eaten a day?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is quite something.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:10%
Sprouts, juices.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:10%
You also are big
on GMOs versus GEs.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:10%
I want to start the
conversation here

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.786 align:middle line:10%
because there's so much to
talk about on this topic.

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:10%
But what is the difference?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:10%
What is it exactly?

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.192 align:middle line:10%
I think we're not educated
enough about this.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CLEMENT: You have to
understand the history of food

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and the history of
life on this planet.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
All life began with
blue-green algae.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a single-cell
life form that

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:84%
was created billions of
years ago on this Earth.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And we now think it was
a marriage between what

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%
we call vitamin C and nitrogen.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And nitrogen makes things grow.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The single-cell life form
created oxygen or you

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:90%
and I wouldn't be here today.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is part of the program.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And its brother, which is green
algae, so blue-green algae

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and green algae.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Today I got up, as I do six
days a week-- not on my fasting

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
day-- and I consumed
five types of algae.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Three are blue-green,
one green, and one

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:90%
phytoplankton from the water.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:90%
So the primary--

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.406 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is spirulina
is in one of them?

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CLEMENT: Spirulina is a
type of blue-green algae,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
but a little difficult
to digest, most of it.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So you get up and
you look at life.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.969 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it began.

00:10:23.969 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
The second life form on the
planet-- because everything

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
was oceans and water
remember-- was sea vegetables.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's part
of our diet here.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, when the land
came, and the very first land

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that came up was what we
call Australia, the continent

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and the country of Australia.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was a million
years before any other land.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Grasses came.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Now why these are the
most powerful foods, not

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
the only foods we eat-- we
use fruits and vegetables

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:84%
in their organic state,
biological state.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But these primary life forces--
number one, number two,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and number three--
have the ability

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to collect protons from the sun
at a much, much higher level.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Because through
evolution, they created

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:90%
something called chloroplasts.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And chloroplasts were the
original solar collectors.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And we are energy.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:90%
We are literally light.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
We're not physical bodies.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're not biology
and all of this nonsense.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we're failing
in mainstream medicine and also

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
much of natural medicine today.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we look at things
in a very mundane, very

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:90%
matter-based orientation.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Where if you look
at what protons are,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:90%
they're remarkable.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They start in the
middle of the sun.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Right there, this second,
they're being born.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.920 align:middle line:84%
They take 100,000 years to
reach the surface of the sun.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
They bounce back and
forth on neutrons.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.461 align:middle line:90%
So they go one inch.

00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:90%
They go back two inches.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.126 align:middle line:90%
They go an inch.

00:11:48.126 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And go back two inches.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:90%
100,000 years they take.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And friction is created.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's light.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Now a proton is smaller
than nothing, actually.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:90%
An atom is 99.99.99% nothing.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Protons are smaller.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And they're light.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:90%
They're invisible life forces.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they hit the
surface of the sun,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
they projectile in 8 and
1/2 minutes to planet Earth.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And plants, starting with
blue-green and green algae, sea

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, and grasses, and
their related seeds and plants,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:84%
capture them on
the chloroplasts.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So all life on this
planet comes from protons

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:90%
captured on green plants.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And why should we
be eating those?

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, why we're sick,
and why the planet's

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
in disarray, and why we
have greenhouse gases

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and we're destroying the
Earth that we live on,

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're polluting
the waters, is

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
we don't get really
simple truths like that.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But somehow we have abstract
ideas, both spiritualistically,

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and economically, and socially.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's wrong.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very much wrong.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So for 60 years here,
we've been proving it.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We're a living laboratory of
bringing people back to life.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And the first way we
do that is not food.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The first way we do that is
get people to look at themself

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and see their strengths.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.580 align:middle line:10%
And their strengths
are what they love.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:10%
Why you're good at what you
do is you love what you do.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.592 align:middle line:10%
And why people fail--
and most people

00:13:10.592 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:10%
are failing in their
lives-- is because they've

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:10%
been convinced that it's
more important to have stuff,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:10%
and to make money,
and to have comfort,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:10%
than it is to be passionate.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:10%
And so we get them passionate.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:10%
And then we say, here are
the tools, called food,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:10%
that give you the
power to become

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:10%
enlightened and conscious.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And we were just
talking of, actually,

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:10%
that this greed that might have
led to the GMOs and the GEs.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:10%
Tell us about that.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.917 align:middle line:10%
Because when did that kicked in?

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle line:10%
And where are we at?

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.230 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of us hear
of Monsanto and the seeds.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:10%
And I even went all
the way to Norway

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.799 align:middle line:10%
to meet with the
seed bank people.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.215 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: We went
to the islands.

00:13:47.215 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:10%
Pretty scary stuff.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:10%
Pretty scary stuff.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.110 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So tell
us what you think.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:10%
What are the GEs?

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: To make this very
simple, through history,

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:10%
there have been evil people
and evil organizations.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we are in one
of those periods

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
now with an evil organization
and its cohorts, Monsanto

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and other
organizations like them

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
that literally, for absolute
profit and control of humanity,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
are manipulating seeds so that
they don't recreate seeds.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So to give a small example--
and I would like anyone

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to check anything I say
because you'll never

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
see me say anything that's
not concretely factual.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.079 align:middle line:84%
That in the country
of India, now,

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
because they went
there and convinced

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
the poor Indian
farmers-- who by the way,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
their families have been farmers
from the beginning of dawn,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
time, they've only

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
been farmers-- that
we have better seeds.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And you better buy our seeds.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And actually, gave
it to them for free.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And when the poor farmer
went to harvest the seeds,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%
there were no seeds.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto then
said, well you have

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:90%
to buy seeds from us again.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So once they eradicated
one year's seeds,

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
they became dependent
upon Monsanto

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.170 align:middle line:90%
and other organizations like it.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
To date, more than 200,000
farmers have committed suicide.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Because their lives,
their passion,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:84%
their pride, the way they
allow their family to survive

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:90%
was taken from them.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.750 align:middle line:90%
This is evil.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's evil.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
What it's doing
on a health level,

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I can speak to that because I
sit here every day and see it.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
We now have a disease that
really didn't exist before,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
called irritable
bowel syndrome, where

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
they are splicing
into things like corn.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And corn is pervasive.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not only corn
chips and cornmeal,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it's corn syrup that's in all of
the sugary drinks that you have

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:90%
and dietary foods.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's endless
what you see this in.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
spliced with something

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:84%
called Agent Orange, which
the new name of Agent Orange,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
which killed people and maimed
people during the Vietnam War,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.650 align:middle line:90%
is called Roundup.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's used worldwide.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:90%
All Monsanto people.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat this
spliced into the corn,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
it actually perforates
your intestinal track.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:90%
This causes cancer.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Here in the United
States as well as

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.800 align:middle line:84%
around the world, the number
one killer of our children

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.070 align:middle line:90%
today is cancer and accidents.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And cancer's at the top of the
list for our babies below five.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And people don't
realize that nobody's

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
watching, that somehow
in the back of your mind

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you think governments around
the world are protecting you.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And environmental
protection agencies,

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
they are all in orchestra
with these evil empires,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:90%
as I call them.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And we better stand up
and take our lives back

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
because this is going to rob
humanity of its vitality,

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
rob the planet even further,
and as you pointed out,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
you've already been to the
bank of seeds where over 80%

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
of the original seeds
are under lock and key,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:90%
and the evil empire has the key.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, whoever
they want to have to eat,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:90%
they have the right to do that.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
And whoever they want
to have stop eating,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
they have the right
to do that now.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:90%
And all of this is quietly done.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a conspiratorial
type of a guy.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
I'm a science guy, a guy who
has for more than four decades

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
watched the result
of this insanity.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to stop.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I know that in this country
through efforts of colleagues

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.552 align:middle line:84%
of mine like Jeffrey Smith,
that I believe in the next five

00:17:26.552 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
years, we're going to actually
throw genetic modified

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
foods out, that
we have about 38%

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
of the American public
now refusing to eat them,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.410 align:middle line:90%
avoiding them.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And when people learn--
it's all about education.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And the listeners
here better learn.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:10%
These are real life issues.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:10%
Sitting around, and
om-ing, and thinking

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:10%
about futuristic things,
put that on the back burner.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:10%
And put the things that matter
on the front burner now.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: What are some
of those-- you said corn.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:10%
But there is also
the fresh juices

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:10%
you're saying should
be 100% organic.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:10%
There is many, many different
items that are crucial for us

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:10%
to-- or soya beans or soya milk.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:10%
These are the
things that would be

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.945 align:middle line:10%
more affected by
these modified genes?

00:18:09.945 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Well, let's
explain the most common ones

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:10%
that are genetically modified.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, insane
things are happening.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
tomatoes, they've

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
been putting fish genes
for over 25 years.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So you can say to somebody,
I'm a plant-based eater.

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And unless you're eating
ecological, or biological,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
or organic food,
it's most likely

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
your commercial food has
fish in it if it's a tomato.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Pork has had human genes in
it for about the same time,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:90%
25 years.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually eating one
of your fellow humans, Homo

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, if you're
eating pork and it's not

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
rare form that you

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
don't find because it's
all factory farmed.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Soybeans, you are correct.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The majority of soybeans,
genetically modified.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Things like zucchini
squash, yellow squash,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
papayas from Hawaii
and China-- so these

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
are things to absolutely
totally avoid.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:90%
And the list goes on.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And again, nobody's watching.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Governments are actually
supporting these people.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.330 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I've
read-- not just read

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:10%
but spoke with Stall Schaller,
Dr. Stall Schaller in Geneva,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:10%
in Lausanne actually.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:10%
And we were talking
about how important

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:10%
it is our resonance with the
food, too, or the therapist.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:10%
So what we're
thinking of what we're

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.634 align:middle line:10%
eating is even more precious
than the food itself, no?

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Absolutely.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, look we
all want-- and this

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:10%
used to be something
that you'd hear about

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:10%
in theological or
philosophical corners.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we in the science
community have proven this.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the work of
HeartMath as an example.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:84%
They've actually monitored
events to show our unification.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And usually during times
of trauma and fear,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:84%
we see that that
unification comes.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And we all feel as one humanity.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And I hear people who
are pretty negative,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
empty cup people
as I call them, say

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that we need Martians
to invade the world

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll stop
fighting with one another.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.999 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't think that's
ever going to happen.

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I think we can do
is realize that we're one.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And we all want the same things.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%
We want love.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:90%
We want harmony.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.200 align:middle line:90%
We want peace.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:90%
We want security.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:90%
We want health.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we respect
what we want and honor

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that other people should
have the same rights,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.200 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be fine.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So eating a plant is meant
to be for the human species.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday, or two
days ago, in Toronto

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I gave an extensive talk on
how anthropology is wrong.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.795 align:middle line:84%
They say we're
hunters and gatherers.

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't believe that.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe those
who unfortunately

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
got lost on their trips out of
Ethiopia, the origins of Homo

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, 7,000 to
8,000, 10,000 years ago.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.680 align:middle line:84%
We came out of that beautiful
valley as plant-based eaters.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we got caught
in northern Europe.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And we went to the North Pole.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:90%
People are little goofy.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:90%
They kept walking.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they were up there
in the middle of winter.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And they actually saw the
only way they could survive

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.114 align:middle line:90%
is eating an animal.

00:21:05.114 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that happened.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:90%
It's an abomination.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In the world's population
today, the primary diet

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
for 60% of the public
is plant-based.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we are
minorities in countries

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:84%
that eat large amounts
of animal-based food.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
There's so much empirical
evidence on this.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.020 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So the plant is
sacrificing itself to you.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:90%
You resonate with the plant.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Your cells work at 75
hertz if they're healthy.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:90%
The plant is higher than that.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.430 align:middle line:84%
When you ingest it, it goes
through the digestion process.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It gives a fuel for
that energetic frequency

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:90%
that healthy cells require.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, animal-based foods,
dead animals and the secretions

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
called milk from the
animals and yogurt and all

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
this bizarre stuff that
they make literally

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.484 align:middle line:90%
have no energetic fields.

00:21:51.484 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And they actually suck
energy out of the human body.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.169 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I was
thinking of something.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.870 align:middle line:10%
I forgot my question.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:10%
I had this question
regarding-- how come we?

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:10%
How come we crave now these
days these greens and this raw?

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:10%
It seems like as we're
opening up and evolving

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:10%
and I hear it so often.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And now, this past week
has been pretty intense

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:10%
for me, this craving.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.740 align:middle line:10%
And I know I'm not the only one.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:10%
How come is it?

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:10%
Has time come for raw food?

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Well, time
was here for raw food.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:10%
We sort of slipped aside.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Every creature on earth except
humans eat 100% raw food diet.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:90%
So let's give you the numbers.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So from the dawn
of time, since man

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:84%
has been writing things
down, and analyzing things,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and creating what we
call science today,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
we've identified
1,800,000 species.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, there's
millions of others

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:90%
we haven't identified.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's estimated every day
we may be killing hundreds

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of species we've never seen--
microbes, and bacteria, as god

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:90%
knows.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So out of the 1,800,000
species that we've identified,

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
100% of those species
eat 100% raw diet.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Humans are the only
ones that do not.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Now let's fast forward
to Hippocrates.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So our founder, thank
god, was facing death

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and decided to eat a raw
food diet because she watched

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
her doctor grandmother
in Europe feed raw foods

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:90%
to people who were dying.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:90%
It healed her stage-4 cancer.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're best known
for here at Hippocrates

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is we've had more people
reverse catastrophic disease

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
than any organization in
the history of health care.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean health care
we're talking about,

00:23:29.135 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:84%
not natural health care,
all of health care.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And after medicine and
other methodologies fail,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:90%
people show up here.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We are not lucky like
a hospital or a doctor

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
where they get the person
when they're first ill.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Usually people, because
we're not so wise

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and the system is
very negative, have

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
to go through
catastrophic concerns

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and then be told it's failing
or become conscious enough

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.940 align:middle line:90%
to say it's failing.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And then they show up here.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And we watch people.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Once they allow themself
to become aware,

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
like you're suggesting now,
then they gravitate to this.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I could-- this
big, fat, obese American guy,

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
smoking cigarettes
and loving meat.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.900 align:middle line:90%
My diet was meat and dairy food.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:08.939 align:middle line:90%
I didn't eat vegetables.

00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't eat fruit.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.939 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what they were.

00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:12.355 align:middle line:84%
They were something
I didn't like.

00:24:12.355 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing I knew.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
If I could change,
anyone can change.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And we see it here
every single week.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We have people arrive
from every corner

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of the globe with
different maladies

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and an ever-growing
group of healthy people

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that come here like
you who say, hey,

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm resonating with
this kind of lifestyle.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And intuitively
and instinctually,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:90%
we're raw food eaters.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:90%
We're plant-based eaters.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So once you let go
of your addictions,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
and preconceived notion, and
cultural indoctrinations,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and habits and habitual
activities, it surfaces.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Your truth is always there.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just about how much
are we suppressing it?

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I'm sure a
lot of people watching

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:54.090 align:middle line:10%
this video on Gaiam have
tried or have practiced.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.845 align:middle line:10%
Like for me, I was a
raw vegan for a year.

00:24:55.845 --> 00:24:57.470 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a
sudden, there's life.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.179 align:middle line:10%
I was back in London
in a different city.

00:24:59.179 --> 00:24:59.678 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:24:59.678 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:10%
You lose your job.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:10%
Things happen.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:10%
And then you go back to this.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:10%
What is the secret to longevity
within the raw food vegan?

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Self respect.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what happens is when
we question ourself as people,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.220 align:middle line:90%
we sabotage our lives.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.590 align:middle line:84%
When you have fulfillment, la
passion, the life is fulfilled,

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:84%
then we always do the
best for ourselves.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.900 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, this year
I'm travelling 200 days.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it hard to do it?

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is hard to do
once you commit it to you.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that comes
here to Hippocrates

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.307 align:middle line:90%
see gifted psychotherapists.

00:25:37.307 --> 00:25:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Do we think everyone needs them?

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You and I need them.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
We need friends outside of
our self, outside of our mind,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
at times to say, well,
that's a great way you're

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:90%
thinking about it.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
But look this way, a
nuance, a little change,

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:90%
a little difference.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.575 align:middle line:84%
And that little change or nuance
can revolutionize our life.

00:25:54.575 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:10%
But it's easy when
we're surrounded here

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:10%
in this environment, and
with the greens all around,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:10%
and the sunshine, and the cooks.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's a little easier
than our regular, busy lives.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:10%
So is that just a
matter of commitment?

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.880 align:middle line:10%
Or is there some
rules, or some things,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.250 align:middle line:10%
or a certain discipline, or
even some other practices

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:10%
that are needed to stay there?

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>CLEMENT: Well, why we
have Hippocrates Institute

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:84%
is so that people can come
here and be in a supportive

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:90%
environment and learn.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So what you're coming
here for is learning.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
This is sort of like a
university of lifestyle.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
We call it, correctly, the
life transformation program.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And every week, on Friday,
we have a formal graduation

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
commencement.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And people stand up, week after
week, person after person,

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
with the transformations
they've had.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So after 60 years, we sort
of figured this thing out.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is not hard to do
this anywhere on the planet

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:84%
once you encapsulate
yourself in love.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the most powerful and
most rewarding thing we have is

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.619 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing stronger.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.110 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
greater than love.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you have that
love and self respect,

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:12.936 align:middle line:84%
and then you share
that, you have

00:27:12.936 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:90%
to have enough in yourself.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a cup that just
is running over like a hose

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
spraying everyone with love.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Then it doesn't matter where
you or how hard the circumstance

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:84%
appears to be, that's
all in the mind.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.880 align:middle line:84%
You always do
what's best for you

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.700 align:middle line:90%
when you have that love present.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.409 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: You say you
cure here cancer.

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:31.450 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:10%
Or it's healed?

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:10%
It's truly healed?

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:10%
What is the scientific proof
that raw food can actually

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.934 align:middle line:10%
heal such diseases?

00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Well, if you
have another 10 hours,

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.391 align:middle line:10%
we can give you the
scientific proof.

00:27:41.391 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I write for the
academic community

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:90%
books like Food Is Medicine.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I have a three-volume
series, "Food Is Medicine."

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
All of my books reference
science and the work we've

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:90%
done here for six decades.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:90%
But we don't cure anything.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:90%
That's the old paradigm.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The old paradigm is you come
to me, you pay me enough money,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and I cure you.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:90%
That's a lie.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's never going to work.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:10%
It never has worked, et cetera.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:10%
You come here and
our mission statement

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:10%
is, help people help themself.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.307 align:middle line:10%
So the only one that can
heal you, love, is you.

00:28:12.307 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You're your own doctor.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Exactly.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:10%
So we give you the tool.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:10%
We give you the support.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:10%
When people graduate
Hippocrates,

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.650 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of your
life, we counsel you.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So you may come here with
brain cancer, or HIV,

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.370 align:middle line:84%
or multiple sclerosis,
or Parkinson's disease,

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:31.216 align:middle line:84%
or easy things like
diabetes or heart disease,

00:28:31.216 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
which aren't
diseases by the way.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:84%
They're complete
lifestyle choices.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And after you've gone through
the education, and the support,

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and the technologies,
and the treatments,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and the electromagnetic, and the
cold laser, and the CyberScan,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and the undermed,
and blah, blah, blah.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just food here, love.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all about energy.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Even the food is energy.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And transforming the energy on a
physical and a conscious level.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, then you
launch off as our children,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.960 align:middle line:84%
our adolescent child
going into the world.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And we hold your hand
forever doing that.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And we guide you.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:90%
And we say, here's what it is.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The other day, before I left
on my last tour of Canada,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I actually was looking
at a file and answering

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.000 align:middle line:84%
a woman who came to Hippocrates
44 years ago, before my time

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.190 align:middle line:84%
at Hippocrates, before I was
living this way, actually.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've gotten to know
her because she comes

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.350 align:middle line:84%
back for holidays here,
as many people do.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
As you know, it's
a resort setting.

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Several of them
come back yearly.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.150 align:middle line:90%
And I remember talking to her.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, when you
came here 44 years ago,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and you were given
up to die, what

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.950 align:middle line:90%
gave you the impetus to come?

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:90%
She said, fear at first.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I was completely frightened.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.422 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to die.

00:29:41.422 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know why
I wanted to live.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:10%
But I knew I didn't want to die.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:10%
She said, then when I
came to Hippocrates,

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:10%
I realized that this was a place
that didn't give you false hope

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:10%
but gave you you.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well,
you've got it then.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.270 align:middle line:10%
Because what our job is
to get you back to you.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And once you find
you, you're powerful.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can't do.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.840 align:middle line:90%
God lives within you.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
This is not a theological
or philosophical approach.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You have the energy of the
universe inside of you.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing
you're incapable of.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, this woman healed herself.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the way, she's
a great-grandmother.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
She just told me she came
back from hiking in the Alps

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in an early spring on snowshoes
with her great-grandchildren.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is what
you're capable of.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Schaller, a good friend of
mine who you spoke to recently,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
we had a friend called
Happy that literally

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
at her 100th birthday,
when she was 100 years old,

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:84%
jumped off the Alps
and hang glided.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.967 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her right here
at Hippocrates, Happy,

00:30:37.967 --> 00:30:38.800 align:middle line:90%
why did you do that?

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I had
never done it before.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.326 align:middle line:90%
That's the right answer.

00:30:42.326 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:10%
So there's not
some proof that we

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:10%
can talk right now about,
or scientific proof,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.687 align:middle line:10%
or some elements there, or
some figures, or some numbers?

00:30:50.687 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Let's explain to you.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.370 align:middle line:10%
Let's explain to you.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:10%
The sickest people in
the world come here.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.164 align:middle line:10%
After medicine fails,
after they failed,

00:30:57.164 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:10%
after they're told
they're going to die,

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:10%
this is who we work with.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:10%
Tens of thousands have
healed themselves.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.395 align:middle line:90%
We don't cure them.

00:31:03.395 --> 00:31:04.270 align:middle line:90%
They heal themselves.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when they leave
here, I'm not with them.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.060 align:middle line:90%
The Institute's not there.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.610 align:middle line:10%
They get the inner
strength to say,

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:10%
yes, I have the power
of god and I can heal.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, with that said, we
give them the viable tools.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Why does living food do it?

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Living food has four elements
in it that once you cook

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
it are gone: hormones, oxygen,
phytochemicals, and enzymes.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are the
language between cells.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So how cells mutate, they're
not getting a clear direction.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And so who are the
ones getting direction

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.065 align:middle line:90%
are called stem cells.

00:31:35.065 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:10%
They're the new cells that make
your skin, and make your bones,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and make every
organ in your body.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:10%
And if, for instance,
the cell that's leaving

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.860 align:middle line:10%
doesn't have enough hormones
to secrete out and say,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:10%
here's what I want
you to be, a liver.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:10%
I want you to be a heart.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:84%
This poor cell mutates
and becomes odd.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The only cells that can become
cancer cells, for instance,

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:55.600 align:middle line:90%
are stem cells.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:10%
They're like adolescents that
the child molester cancer

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:10%
cell goes and convinces
to become cancer.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:10%
Number two is oxygen.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.510 align:middle line:10%
Way back at the
turn of the century,

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.260 align:middle line:10%
we realized-- 20th
century-- we realized

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:10%
that oxygen was necessary
to ingest nutrients.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So which food has
oxygen present?

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Raw plant-based food.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you cook it, the fragrance
that comes out of the food

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
oxygen leaving it.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.046 align:middle line:84%
So the nutrients like proteins,
and vitamins, and minerals,

00:32:22.046 --> 00:32:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and now essential
fats that we've

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.378 align:middle line:84%
learned about, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:32:25.378 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Phytochemicals, which
is the next one,

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:84%
do not work in the body, do not
become part of your innate body

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and protect your
body unless you're

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:90%
getting it from raw food.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Phytochemicals, I could
speak about for another 10

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:90%
hours with you.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Phytochemicals are sort
of a new discovery.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.450 align:middle line:90%
1948, discovered.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Not really looked at
seriously till the '90s.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Now it's the most
important pioneering event

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.140 align:middle line:84%
in the history of biology
as well as nutrition.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.600 align:middle line:84%
We found that in plants that
go back billions of years ago,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The first creature was a
trilobite only 550 million

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And this is billions of years.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Blue-green algae,
billions of years.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Then plants came.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I explained
that history to you.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They had in it, and
still have in it,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.070 align:middle line:84%
elements called
phytochemicals that

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
fight disease and
prevent disease.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Humans didn't show up until
7,000, 8,000, 9,000 years ago--

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And these plants that are
billions of years old literally

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:84%
have elements in it that fight
disease called phytochemicals.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Raw food has it.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Once you cook it, finished.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Last is enzymes.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Your bioelectric body.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.309 align:middle line:84%
When I measure you,
when you go to a doctor,

00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:84%
a mainstream doctor--
they don't even

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
know what they're doing,
by the way-- they check

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:90%
your electromagnetic frequency.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
What is an MRI?

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.070 align:middle line:90%
What is a CT scan?

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:90%
What is an ultrasound?

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It's checking the
biofrequency of your organs.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But because the pharmaceutical
industry has control,

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
then they treat
you with chemicals.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.523 align:middle line:10%
That's like me bringing you to
the top of the Alps and saying,

00:33:50.523 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:10%
look at the vista.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:10%
We can see Italy.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.270 align:middle line:10%
We can see Austria.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:10%
We can see Switzerland.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.466 align:middle line:10%
Then I drag you to the
bottom, throw you in the mud,

00:33:56.466 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:10%
and give you chemicals.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:10%
And so this is so
scientifically proven,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.389 align:middle line:10%
you may want to get
on a web presence

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:10%
that I put together
with a colleague called

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.346 align:middle line:10%
therealtruthabouthealth.com.

00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:09.640 align:middle line:10%


00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:10%
therealtruthabouthealth.com.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:14.480 align:middle line:10%
We do ongoing teleseminars.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.560 align:middle line:10%
We also are giving
nothing but facts.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And you could have
140 hours of me

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:10%
yelling about
science if you want.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:10%
And you can Google it.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.100 align:middle line:10%
So anything I've ever
said on liver cancer,

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.033 align:middle line:10%
or being pretty, or sex, boom,
you put up, and it comes up.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:28.949 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: That's right.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:32.190 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of books that
you do on sex and intimacy.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.605 align:middle line:10%
What's the link with raw food?

00:34:35.605 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:10%
Apart that raw food is sexy.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Raw food is sexy.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.469 align:middle line:10%
A lot of the actors and
actresses and famous models

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:10%
come here because it
does make you sexy.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.199 align:middle line:10%
But I write books on
subjects to expose

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:10%
what I consider to be truth.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:52.120 align:middle line:10%
And religion hijacked
sex centuries ago,

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:10%
and made it dirty, and made it
bad, and made it unfortunate.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:10%
And I think sex is the
greatest drive we have.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.840 align:middle line:10%
Until the day we die, let's
hope it's well over 100, you

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:10%
and I, that our main
drive to comb our hair,

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.210 align:middle line:10%
to put nice clothes on, to
get dressed up, in your case,

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.840 align:middle line:10%
to put makeup on,
is that sex hormone.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.780 align:middle line:10%
And every thought you have,
every action you have,

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.160 align:middle line:10%
your choices come
from sex hormones.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Now to deny that and to suppress
it is going to make you sick.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.160 align:middle line:10%
And I believe a lot
of the disorders

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:10%
we have are suppressed
sex activities.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:10%
When I was a little boy, in
my book with my wife, Dr. Anna

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.500 align:middle line:10%
Maria Clement, I write
about how I was brought up

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:10%
in a parochial setting.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:10%
And the nuns who
taught me literally

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:10%
said that if I kissed a
girl from another religion,

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:10%
the ground would
open up, literally,

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:10%
I would go down,
and burn in hell.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.238 align:middle line:10%
Don't you know I fell
in love with a girl

00:35:41.238 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:10%
from another religion
when I was 14.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.180 align:middle line:10%
And when I kissed her, boy,
I was looking at the ground.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:10%
But I was willing to kiss her.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Because biology is much
stronger than theology.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:90%
So biology is the main force.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And sex is your main
part of biology.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:10%
That's really why you
and I are here, you know?

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.790 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I'm discovering that.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.322 align:middle line:10%
Wow.

00:36:00.322 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: We think we're
here for all these reasons,

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:10%
but it's to perpetuate
more humans.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:10%
The primary biology of
the human experience

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:10%
is self-realization,
self-preparation.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Yes.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:10%
How come some people
go all the way

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:10%
to the self-realization
and some not?

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.480 align:middle line:10%
How come some people heal
themselves and some not?

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.470 align:middle line:10%
How come somebody, even with
the greatest diet, the greatest

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.460 align:middle line:10%
advice, would not heal?

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.160 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Because of self
respect, lack of self respect.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.330 align:middle line:10%
Unless you see your purpose--
as I always call it, PP.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:10%
You have to have PP.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:10%
Passionate Purpose.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.559 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have a
passionate purpose in life,

00:36:39.559 --> 00:36:40.933 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
find a way to go.

00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:41.990 align:middle line:10%
Nature takes care of you.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:43.860 align:middle line:10%
Nature's loving but powerful.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:10%
Nature gets you out of the way
if you're not contributing.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:10%
And it's OK.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:10%
As I say to people
here, unless you're

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:10%
ready to change your
heart about who you are,

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:10%
you may want to leave.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:10%
Because I'm going to prolong
your life and your agony.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.510 align:middle line:10%
If you're willing
to change your heart

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.025 align:middle line:10%
and have a life
that's worth living,

00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:10%
that you bounce out of
bed every day and say,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:10%
boy, am I happy, do I
love what I'm doing,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.700 align:middle line:10%
then you're going to love
what I'm teaching you.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And wheatgrass.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.397 align:middle line:10%
Last thing about
wheatgrass and sprouts.

00:37:09.397 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:10%
Because you're very big on that.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:10%
And every day people
have juices, wheatgrass,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:10%
and sprouts.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:10%
Why is that so big?

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.660 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Well, number
one, a sprout, going back

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:10%
to the statistics, is generally
10 to 30 times more nutritious

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:10%
than the best biological,
organic, ecological vegetable

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:10%
you grow in your own garden.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.060 align:middle line:10%
So if you have a great, great
garden filled with kale, as

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.200 align:middle line:10%
an example, or collared
greens, or chard,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:10%
that's a great,
nutritious vegetable.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:10%
That's 10 times less
nutritious than a clover sprout

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:10%
and 30 times less nutritious
than a sunflower sprout.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:10%
So if you're going to
bother to juice something,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:10%
and drink it, or eat it,
you should have sprouts.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:10%
Again, the vitality, the
energetic level of a sprout

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:10%
is phenomenal.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.000 align:middle line:10%
You may want to get on the
internet and look this up.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.830 align:middle line:10%
When you do chromium
photography, which

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:10%
has been done over
the decades, you

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:10%
see this energetic
field that goes out

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:10%
two feet beyond one
little, tiny sprout.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:10%
Nothing does that other
than algae, both sea algaes,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:10%
sea vegetables, and
freshwater algaes, blue-green

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.872 align:middle line:10%
and green algaes.

00:38:12.872 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:10%
The other thing is
that when you're

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:10%
looking at sprouts
that this knocks down

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:10%
the economic barriers.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:10%
So when I've been in UN projects
in Egypt and in India decades

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.340 align:middle line:10%
ago, I could bring
in a kilo of seeds

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.030 align:middle line:10%
and show them how to
make 10 kilos of food.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.942 align:middle line:10%
Most protein, most vitamins,
most minerals, 10, 20,

00:38:32.942 --> 00:38:34.600 align:middle line:10%
30 times more nutritious.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:10%
We could literally wiped
out world starvation

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:10%
if you gave me the grains
that France, Germany, England

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and Canada threw away
on a yearly basis.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.070 align:middle line:10%
If you just gave
me those grains,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.010 align:middle line:10%
gave me 150,000
volunteers worldwide,

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:10%
we'd wipe out world
starvation in 18 months.

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.170 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: I hear that Hippocrates
is-- that's big number.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:10%
It's a nonprofit organization.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:10%
Is there some projects
like that outside?

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.455 align:middle line:10%
And some of that money
going for starving people?

00:39:02.455 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Yes.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.540 align:middle line:10%
We actually do those projects.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And as often as
I'm invited, I go

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.290 align:middle line:10%
into underprivileged communities
worldwide and teach them.

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:13.165 align:middle line:10%
Islands and continents
around the world.

00:39:13.165 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:10%
I just donated to a friend
of yours, for instance.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.240 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully
she'll bring sprouts

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.270 align:middle line:10%
into a community of
impoverished people

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:10%
who are dying of illness.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:10%
So I support these things.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.800 align:middle line:10%
And as a nonprofit, our
main and foremost objective

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.774 align:middle line:10%
is to change humanity not
to gain a big bank account.

00:39:30.774 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Because
that's a big one.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty much the paradigm
that we're trapped in, no?

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:36.780 align:middle line:10%
This whole money paradigm?

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.420 align:middle line:10%
Is that really
what-- because I've

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.530 align:middle line:10%
interviewed Foster
Gamble here, too.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.530 align:middle line:10%
From the movie "Thrive."

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:10%
Great guy.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:10%
The food is there.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:10%
The food kind of is
the-- what starts first?

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the chicken or
the egg kind of thing?

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Because is it first
that we have to be

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:10%
conscious to then eat food?

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:57.660 align:middle line:10%
Or is it really a question
of the big institutions

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:10%
or the money power to-- how
does this whole world really

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.670 align:middle line:10%
flip around?

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.509 align:middle line:10%
That's my question.

00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: It's pretty
simple because we've

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:09.840 align:middle line:10%
been flipping people's worlds
around here since the 1950s.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't start
on a personal level--

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.770 align:middle line:10%
Gandhi taught us that.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Martin Luther King
taught us that.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:10%
Mandela taught us that.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.190 align:middle line:10%
Mother Teresa taught us that.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.000 align:middle line:10%
How often do we
have to be taught?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.930 align:middle line:10%
For those who are Christians,
Jesus Christ taught.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.090 align:middle line:10%
Buddha taught us that.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:10%
On and on it went.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:10%
And so it is about taking
self responsibility.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.260 align:middle line:10%
So if you don't take
control of your life,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.664 align:middle line:10%
if you don't eat proper food,
you're part of the problem.

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:10%
If you're eating meat,
if you're eating dairy,

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:10%
you're part of greenhouse gases.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:10%
You're part of the degradation
of the planet Earth.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.460 align:middle line:10%
You're part of making
your body sick.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.086 align:middle line:10%
And so don't whine,
and don't complain,

00:40:43.086 --> 00:40:44.918 align:middle line:10%
and don't tell me you're
an environmentalist

00:40:44.918 --> 00:40:46.380 align:middle line:10%
and that you're a
conscious person.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness has to be
manifested in action.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm not interested in theology.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm interested in action.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.430 align:middle line:10%
And so when I see people
act, they can heal disease.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.930 align:middle line:10%
They can live long happy lives.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:10%
And they can be
contributors with what?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.227 align:middle line:10%

00:41:00.227 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Thank you so much
for this delicious interview.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:10%
And for all of you watching
this on Gaiam, please comment.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:10%
And let's get this
conversation out and rolling.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.254 align:middle line:10%
>>CLEMENT: Thank you
so much for being here.

00:41:12.254 --> 00:41:13.836 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Much, much
love to all of you

00:41:13.836 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:10%
from delicious, sunny Florida.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm about to drink wheatgrass.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.054 align:middle line:10%
Bye-bye.

00:41:18.054 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:10%
We didn't even have time
to speak of all this.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.790 align:middle line:10%
But we'll have some
more conversation.

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Much love.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:10%
Bye.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Cut.
