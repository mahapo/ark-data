>> Lilou: [Background Music]
Hello my Delicious co-creators,

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.613 align:middle line:90%
Lilou.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.815 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road actually
today in Sta.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.585 align:middle line:84%
Cruz after all these European
traveling I have to stop

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.254 align:middle line:84%
by California because this
is such a resourceful place

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.257 align:middle line:84%
with amazing people
really taking on big things

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:26.459 align:middle line:90%
and big change for the world.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You're the-- You've created
this amazing movie called Thrive

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of us know and
have seen and might even be

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.435 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV, I guess so.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Foster Gamble: Yeah

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Foster Gamble: Well,
it's nice to be back

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.372 align:middle line:90%
with the Gaiam community.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:43.543 align:middle line:84%
I have so much respect for
the information and the beauty

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.046 align:middle line:84%
and love that is coming
through this network

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.014 align:middle line:84%
so I'm honored to
be back on again.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.118 align:middle line:84%
And this time I really want
to focus on the solution

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:56.523 align:middle line:84%
because we spoke and there're
many videos about the issues

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.392 align:middle line:84%
on the reality check that needs
to happen and all of that.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.295 align:middle line:84%
But here you have the chance
to have-- well not the chance,

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.297 align:middle line:84%
it was-- it's been a lot
of work that you've been

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.565 align:middle line:90%
out there researching.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And you met a lot of wonderful
people as a consequence

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.769 align:middle line:84%
of putting so much
information out.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.105 align:middle line:84%
You receive feedback,
you receive email,

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:16.343 align:middle line:84%
you receive solutions that you
were maybe not even thinking

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:17.544 align:middle line:90%
of before.

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.547 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to see
what are those, you know,

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.049 align:middle line:84%
what's really happening
in the world?

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.618 align:middle line:90%
How much hope can we have?

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And do we already is-- already
everything out there, you know?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Foster Gamble: Well, in
our title, we asked Thrive,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.692 align:middle line:90%
"What on earth will it take?"

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.096 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't indicating
that we have all the answers.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.664 align:middle line:90%
We were just in that quest

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.633 align:middle line:84%
and we had found some
important things.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:43.203 align:middle line:84%
But we were really asking the
world, what is it going to take?

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.306 align:middle line:84%
And the response has
been so fantastic

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.276 align:middle line:84%
and still we get a thousand
communications a day.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:55.015 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
creative, compassionate,

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:58.985 align:middle line:84%
really courageous people
working on solutions

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:00.854 align:middle line:90%
in so many different areas.

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:05.358 align:middle line:84%
We finally in response created
a Solutions Hub on our website.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:08.361 align:middle line:84%
Because everywhere we travel
there were spontaneous groups

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.264 align:middle line:84%
emerging often Thrive inspired,
sometimes there's Thrive

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.968 align:middle line:84%
in their title that were
taking on different issues.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.471 align:middle line:84%
And so we have been
ongoingly creating a more

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:23.476 align:middle line:84%
and more effective internet
hub where people can connect

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.446 align:middle line:84%
with each other by
sector, by issue,

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:29.049 align:middle line:84%
by level of engagement,
by region.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:84%
They can either work locally
or connect around the world

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.553 align:middle line:90%
to take on different issues.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:38.291 align:middle line:84%
And they're already
taking on over 125 issues.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.193 align:middle line:90%
And that can be overwhelming

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.828 align:middle line:84%
if you think you
have to do them all.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.463 align:middle line:84%
But people are doing
just the ones

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.765 align:middle line:90%
that they feel most drawn to do.

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:49.369 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually go on in our
website at thrivemovement.com.

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.039 align:middle line:84%
Go to the Solutions
Hub under Get Engaged

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can then search for a
group or you can create a group.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.612 align:middle line:84%
So you can search by
your area or you can put

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.948 align:middle line:90%
in a topic like chemtrails.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:07.187 align:middle line:84%
And there are-- you'll see this
list of topics and I clicked

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
on chemtrails because Kimberly
is doing a blog on chemtrails.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.393 align:middle line:84%
I clicked on it yesterday,
there're 64 different groups

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.729 align:middle line:84%
around the world who are
all working on chemtrails.

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.165 align:middle line:84%
So now what they're doing is
connecting with each other

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:26.573 align:middle line:84%
and sharing books, DVDs,
websites, artwork, petitions,

00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.875 align:middle line:90%
class actions, lawsuits, and how

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.844 align:middle line:84%
to raise money for
your projects.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:33.079 align:middle line:84%
So then instead of us being
a bottleneck through all

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.348 align:middle line:84%
that information, we're just
looking to connect people

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:84%
who are already know what
they're going to be working on,

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.253 align:middle line:90%
want to find another-- a group

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.356 align:middle line:84%
or more people to
work on and with.

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.325 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking
advantage of it.

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:49.027 align:middle line:84%
There're over 800 groups from
90 plus countries right now

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:49.996 align:middle line:90%
who are doing that.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:52.832 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the
exactly the antidote

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.868 align:middle line:84%
to the global domination
agenda which is

00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:58.772 align:middle line:84%
about centralizing power and
then using deception and force

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.373 align:middle line:90%
to control people's lives.

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:03.777 align:middle line:90%
This is about being transparent.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.479 align:middle line:90%
It's about decentralizing power.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.283 align:middle line:84%
And then we're all
empowering each other

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:13.186 align:middle line:84%
to actually fulfill
each person's vision

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.521 align:middle line:84%
in collaboration
with each other.

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:16.823 align:middle line:84%
So it's tremendously
rewarding what's going on.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And you
have resolution,

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:21.261 align:middle line:84%
I know free energy is
a big topic for you.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.197 align:middle line:84%
You've been-- how many
years, 15, 20 years?

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.665 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: I've been in
the field for 12 years.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.334 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying the
physics and the geometry

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.336 align:middle line:90%
and so forth my entire life.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:35.175 align:middle line:84%
But it first led to
my discovering various

00:04:35.175 --> 00:04:38.011 align:middle line:84%
and remarkable inventors
about 12 years ago.

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.447 align:middle line:84%
So it's the biggest single
response we've got and other

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.516 align:middle line:84%
than to solutions in
general from Thrive has been

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:45.552 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility
of free energy.

00:04:45.552 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Especially because people
recognize that it's one

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.293 align:middle line:84%
of the things that could
make the biggest difference

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.694 align:middle line:90%
so quickly.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:57.197 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
blessed to be approached

00:04:57.197 --> 00:05:00.433 align:middle line:90%
by over 150 energy inventors.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:05.171 align:middle line:84%
And another 150 or 200
inventors in other fields

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:11.978 align:middle line:84%
like health devices and new
types of organic agriculture

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:16.216 align:middle line:84%
and hydroponics and so forth as
well as decontamination devices,

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:19.986 align:middle line:84%
devices that with no chemicals
purify and revitalize water.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.955 align:middle line:90%
It's just so inspiring.

00:05:21.955 --> 00:05:25.091 align:middle line:84%
We-- The last line of our
theme song for Thrive was,

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.193 align:middle line:84%
"We already have what
it takes to thrive."

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.662 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
only confirmed.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.866 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, these-- so these
inventors are contacting us.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:36.236 align:middle line:84%
So we put together some vetting
teams, some experts in physics

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.706 align:middle line:84%
and engineering, some in law,
some in security and so forth

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:44.144 align:middle line:84%
that can go out and visit the
labs that seem most promising.

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:47.313 align:middle line:84%
And I've been blessed to
visit many, many labs.

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.816 align:middle line:84%
And I'm under nondisclosure
agreements so I can't talk

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:52.385 align:middle line:84%
about all of the details
and it would be dangerous

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
for the inventors
to do so anyway.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.924 align:middle line:84%
I can just tell you that I
am so relieved and so excited

00:05:57.924 --> 00:06:00.593 align:middle line:84%
to see what's actually
going on in the world.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:05.231 align:middle line:84%
And then the flipside of that is
that we've also been approached

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:08.835 align:middle line:84%
by many, many people of wealth
who have been frustrated

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.437 align:middle line:84%
at not being able
to make a difference

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
in the world big enough
to assure their kids

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and grandkids a safe
healthy world.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.146 align:middle line:84%
So they saw in Thrive
that we know something

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:23.116 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on behind
the scenes that we were willing

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:25.752 align:middle line:84%
to take a risk to
get that word out.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:27.487 align:middle line:90%
And the people seem to trust us.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:30.023 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have been
in connection with this.

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:31.991 align:middle line:84%
And we're now-- we
kind of to refer to--

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.927 align:middle line:84%
and the official name
is Thrive Connect.

00:06:33.927 --> 00:06:36.529 align:middle line:84%
But we're kind of a
cosmic dating service,

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:39.999 align:middle line:84%
where we're hooking up
the money folks, investors

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.635 align:middle line:84%
and philanthropist and so
forth with the innovators.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:46.072 align:middle line:84%
The technical innovators
but also the, you know,

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the social transformation
innovators in all 12 sectors.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're big
relief for those inventors

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.384 align:middle line:84%
to finally have a place to
speak out their inventions

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:01.654 align:middle line:84%
and feel free because a
lot of stories went around

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.856 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how it
is really in reality.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.859 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of-- things have
been suppressed though.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Oh, I can't tell you.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:10.029 align:middle line:90%
It is a very serious situation.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
What we've said in the film was
only the tip of the iceberg.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.301 align:middle line:84%
You know, if anybody
wants to look it up.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.738 align:middle line:84%
If you look up people John
Bedini and Adam Trombly

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:21.374 align:middle line:84%
and Stanley Meyer and not
to mention Nikola Tesla

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.875 align:middle line:84%
and John Circu-- Cyril
[assumed spelling],

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.044 align:middle line:90%
the litany goes on and on.

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:28.414 align:middle line:84%
And people who have been
threatened, stopped,

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:32.585 align:middle line:84%
gag-ordered, and in some cases
disappeared or killed outright

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:36.222 align:middle line:84%
to keep safe clean energy
from being available

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:37.756 align:middle line:90%
to people all over the world.

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:39.659 align:middle line:84%
So it's a-- you know,
it's one of those moments

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:42.028 align:middle line:84%
where our great grandchildren
will look back

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.364 align:middle line:90%
and go, "They use to what?

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Some people didn't want
people to have this?"

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.803 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so one of the
things we recognize is that,

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.006 align:middle line:84%
it takes more than
just a good invention

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:54.807 align:middle line:84%
to make it available
to the world.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.043 align:middle line:84%
You need to be aware
of security issues

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:58.578 align:middle line:90%
and most inventors aren't.

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:02.682 align:middle line:84%
You need to be aware of legal
issues, so you don't get stuck

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.852 align:middle line:84%
into some frivolous lawsuit
that then eats up all your money

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:09.922 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have any left
to complete your invention.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You need to be aware of
win-win business models.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.329 align:middle line:84%
There's often times and
adversarial relationship

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.831 align:middle line:84%
between investors
or philanthropist

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.333 align:middle line:90%
and inventors and innovators.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.001 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need to be there.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.705 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- it needs real
facilitation to make sure

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:29.609 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is being honored
and valued in the arrangements.

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately in
marketing and distribution,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.545 align:middle line:90%
how do you actually make sure

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle line:84%
that the genie can't be
put back in the bottle.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.351 align:middle line:84%
So things-- you know,
the plans need

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.718 align:middle line:84%
to be distributed
all over the world.

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.487 align:middle line:84%
The devices need to
be distributed all

00:08:41.487 --> 00:08:44.257 align:middle line:84%
over the world before
they're announced.

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:47.427 align:middle line:84%
Because if there
would be controllers,

00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:50.096 align:middle line:84%
the suppressors think
that they can stop it,

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
then the inventor is at great
risk because if something happen

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.036 align:middle line:84%
to him, the idea
could die with him.

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.439 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot safer
for the inventors

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.608 align:middle line:84%
if they have the support of the
security teams, business teams

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.712 align:middle line:84%
and enough money to make
sure that they do it right.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:10.416 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more a matter of
politics, money and security

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.419 align:middle line:84%
that these devices haven't
gone out then it is--

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:14.687 align:middle line:90%
device is not working.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.522 align:middle line:84%
There's lot of devices
that don't work.

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:19.592 align:middle line:84%
I would say over 90 percent
of the people who are working

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:21.527 align:middle line:84%
on for energy, they're
haven't got it yet

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.662 align:middle line:90%
or they think they've got it

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.197 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have a
measure and so forth.

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:26.866 align:middle line:84%
But that still leaves
another 10 percent already.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:30.503 align:middle line:84%
Somebody ask me an interview
a couple of weeks ago,

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.772 align:middle line:84%
what I thought the situation
would be in five years

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:35.374 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed myself saying I
think there would be probably

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:39.078 align:middle line:84%
at least 200 companies selling
these new energy technologies

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
around the world
within five years.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.016 align:middle line:90%
And that will change everything.

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And so how do--
what are the one's that work?

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.521 align:middle line:90%
What are they based on?

00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:90%
What is the model?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.491 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Yeah.

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:52.425 align:middle line:90%
Well as I said in the film.

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:53.459 align:middle line:90%
First of all, they're all based

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.794 align:middle line:84%
on "the torus," one
way or another.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.929 align:middle line:90%
It's just like different ways

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:59.398 align:middle line:84%
that you put your
straw into the drink.

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And there are some that create
circuits that act as antennas

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
which just draw energy
in from the environment

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.941 align:middle line:90%
in which we live.

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a sea
of infinite energy.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.178 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of
how do you access

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.013 align:middle line:90%
that in appropriate proportions.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.083 align:middle line:84%
There are others that have
particular arrangements

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:20.787 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic coils in the right
geometries than mimic nature

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.355 align:middle line:90%
to produce other effects.

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:26.092 align:middle line:84%
There are some that involve
arrangements of magnets

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%
or rotating magnetic fields.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.463 align:middle line:84%
There are others that
do what they call--

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.365 align:middle line:84%
or that some of the
inventors called tickling the

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:33.466 align:middle line:90%
nucleus literally.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.668 align:middle line:84%
So you're not getting
a nuclear explosion

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:39.305 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting energy
being released at a low level

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:90%
from the nucleus in ways

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.776 align:middle line:84%
that can actually
generate a lot of power.

00:10:43.776 --> 00:10:47.914 align:middle line:84%
And in one of the themes
that we're seeing which is

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:50.817 align:middle line:84%
such a paradigm shifter
is that traditionally

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.586 align:middle line:84%
with the regular
electromagnetism.

00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:57.523 align:middle line:84%
You create a motor or generator,
you plug in a device, you know,

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:00.092 align:middle line:84%
a heater or a driller,
a hair dryer whatever.

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.495 align:middle line:84%
And each one that
you plug in grinds

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:03.996 align:middle line:90%
down the capacity more and more.

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:05.998 align:middle line:84%
You can hear the
motor go [inaudible].

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.501 align:middle line:90%
Then, you know, it slows down.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.271 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole series of
what are called load following

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
devices which respond
to how much you want--

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.145 align:middle line:90%
how much you're asking.

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:21.047 align:middle line:84%
So that literally, you
plug in the next device

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:22.882 align:middle line:90%
and it goes, "Oh, OK, whoa."

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:25.618 align:middle line:84%
And then you plug in the
next and it goes whoa!

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:29.355 align:middle line:84%
And so it's-- there is
something else going on.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.224 align:middle line:84%
These inventors are
starting to access

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.926 align:middle line:84%
in many cases more
the aetheric rather

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.461 align:middle line:90%
than just the electromagnetic.

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:90%
So consciousness gets involved.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of these inventors,
they have different ways

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.803 align:middle line:84%
at describing it and sometimes
it just intuitive they work

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:44.904 align:middle line:90%
on a hunch.

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.739 align:middle line:84%
Other times it's
interdimensional downloads.

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:48.541 align:middle line:84%
Other times just
direct instruction

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
entities of different sorts.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.147 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of facilitation
going on and those sources

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.149 align:middle line:90%
as well tend to confirm

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:01.087 align:middle line:84%
that we're accessing field
effects rather than just,

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:84%
you know, boiling water
and creating steam.

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.958 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, just
driving electricity

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
with mechanical energy
like that.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That must
be exciting to have.

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.263 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Exciting.

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.464 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I mean the stories

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:14.033 align:middle line:84%
of how they're getting
it too must be thrilling.

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:17.069 align:middle line:84%
ETs, we didn't speak much of
it and our other interviews

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.272 align:middle line:84%
but that's a really
a big resource, huh?

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:20.306 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Yeah.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:22.041 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of the
sources have said

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:23.276 align:middle line:90%
that it was inappropriate

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.778 align:middle line:84%
to have this energy
available before.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:27.246 align:middle line:84%
But now it's exactly
the right time.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.282 align:middle line:90%
In fact it's the necessary time.

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:32.084 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go down
the nuclear path,

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.253 align:middle line:84%
it not only could destroy
all life as we know it

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:36.589 align:middle line:84%
on this planet but
we're being warned

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.825 align:middle line:84%
that that affects not only
our whole solar system

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:41.961 align:middle line:84%
but the whole field of
consciousness and everything.

00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the reasons
why I believe the--

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.334 align:middle line:84%
that we have such a dramatic
increase of sightings

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and direct contact with
extraterrestrials starting

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.473 align:middle line:84%
in 1947, right after
the only two--

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:56.208 align:middle line:84%
you know, the first
two nuclear blast

00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:58.144 align:middle line:84%
that were actually
killed people.

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:02.014 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're getting
facilitation from other beings

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.517 align:middle line:84%
who are more advanced in
some ways than we are.

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Many times probably millions or
billions of years more advanced.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.625 align:middle line:84%
And they know the dangers
of that particular pathway.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:15.294 align:middle line:84%
We need to take the other fork
in the road that we describe

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:20.132 align:middle line:84%
in the film as honoring
the natural flows of energy

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.635 align:middle line:84%
and then dancing with
that in a harmonious way.

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.936 align:middle line:90%
And turns out when you do that,

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:26.038 align:middle line:84%
which about all inventors
are doing,

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:31.143 align:middle line:84%
it pours out clean,
safe and abundant.

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:33.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do you
bring that out then

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.915 align:middle line:84%
into the world 'cause right
now what are you doing,

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.583 align:middle line:90%
where are you at?

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.685 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Well, I can only say
a certain amount about that

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:45.091 align:middle line:84%
because if too much is known
then it's easier to stop.

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:49.395 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing
is decentralizing

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:52.198 align:middle line:84%
so that no one person,
even know on lab

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:57.169 align:middle line:84%
or even one company is holding
the genie in the bottle.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:01.173 align:middle line:84%
So what we're encouraging is
a dispersion of the knowledge,

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:06.245 align:middle line:84%
a dispersion of the devices and
a multitude of companies all

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:09.715 align:middle line:84%
over the world coming
out in synchrony

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
with one another
at the same time.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.687 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind of like that
whack-a-mole game at a park.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.355 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what they
call it in France.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.325 align:middle line:84%
But they have this game where
the mole heads will stick

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:84%
up through these holes
and somebody is supposed

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.729 align:middle line:84%
to whack them back down and
then it pops up elsewhere.

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:26.165 align:middle line:84%
And basically that's what they
controller have been doing is

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.467 align:middle line:84%
that they've been whacking
any adventurers head

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:30.636 align:middle line:84%
that sticks up above
the surface.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:33.039 align:middle line:84%
But if they're all
coming up at the same time

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:36.075 align:middle line:84%
and in multiple places and,
you know, we're suggesting

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:38.544 align:middle line:84%
to all these inventors
and making sure

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.847 align:middle line:84%
that they get the funding
to do this is they--

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:44.083 align:middle line:84%
you know, if the NSA wants
to get into your lab,

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.484 align:middle line:84%
they're probably going
to be in your lab.

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:46.886 align:middle line:90%
They've got that kind of power

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.655 align:middle line:84%
or they're more likely
they got the kind of force.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:52.091 align:middle line:90%
But if that's all recorded

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:55.661 align:middle line:84%
on multiple hidden
surveillance cameras and goes

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:59.598 align:middle line:84%
on YouTube the next hour and
the entire world sees the

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:03.135 align:middle line:84%
suppression of what would
set them free economically

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and energetically.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.808 align:middle line:84%
That's the best chance we
have-- of actual security,

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:12.378 align:middle line:84%
so a dispersal of
the information

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:15.047 align:middle line:90%
as well, of the security.

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:18.884 align:middle line:84%
And then when it
comes to bring it out,

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
rather than just one person
all of a sudden, you know,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.158 align:middle line:84%
putting an ad to sell a
cold free energy device,

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't need to be
brought forward in a fun way,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.964 align:middle line:90%
in a very credible way.

00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:37.369 align:middle line:84%
Potentially at a big, you
know, globally publicized

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:41.107 align:middle line:84%
and broadcast rock concerts,
or something like that.

00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:46.378 align:middle line:84%
Where you suddenly see that the
cameras go backstage and turns

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.581 align:middle line:84%
out the concerts is
being run on free energy.

00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.717 align:middle line:84%
And then you help people come
out on the stage and there are--

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:56.856 align:middle line:84%
are very credible people
from the worlds of science

00:15:56.856 --> 00:16:03.062 align:middle line:84%
and invention and
media and people

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:06.765 align:middle line:84%
who the world would
tend to believe.

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:10.402 align:middle line:84%
And these people have been being
brought up to speak on proof

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:90%
of the technology,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.506 align:middle line:84%
on the theories behind
it, and so forth.

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:16.408 align:middle line:84%
So that then, they can come
forward on mass and say, "Yes,

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:19.512 align:middle line:84%
I know about this, it
is real I'm willing

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:21.113 align:middle line:90%
to stake my reputation on it."

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.783 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time, all-- and
the distribution needs to be,

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:26.285 align:middle line:90%
immediately available.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:28.888 align:middle line:84%
So it merely starts getting
spread around the world.

00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:32.258 align:middle line:84%
But you already have
these technologies working

00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:90%
in small villages, in counties

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.596 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't necessarily be
able to afford it otherwise.

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:39.932 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we're doing
with the inventors is working

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:43.802 align:middle line:84%
out business plans,
where the revenue is

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.437 align:middle line:90%
that would come in from this.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:49.441 align:middle line:84%
A significant percentage of
them go to building more devises

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:53.078 align:middle line:84%
and to getting those devises
out to disadvantage people,

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.047 align:middle line:84%
who would tend to
be last in line.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.782 align:middle line:84%
But who have the
strongest need for energy,

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.751 align:middle line:90%
you know, of all in many cases.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:02.254 align:middle line:84%
So to developed win-win business
strategy so it isn't someone,

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:04.723 align:middle line:84%
you know, hoarding free
energy or hoarding the money

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:07.091 align:middle line:90%
or hoarding the capability.

00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:12.798 align:middle line:84%
But it's really, a whole range
of types of business plans

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
from just publishing the
plans on the internet,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.936 align:middle line:84%
and letting everybody built
this, so you can't put

00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:18.570 align:middle line:90%
that genie back in the bottle.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.206 align:middle line:84%
But if some companies are
already been putting themselves

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:24.243 align:middle line:84%
at risk for decades, they've
got 20, 30 million dollars in--

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.145 align:middle line:84%
into this project,
then it make sense

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
that they would get
acknowledged for that.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.884 align:middle line:84%
But rather than, you know, them
now all of a sudden being the,

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.119 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Microsoft
of computers

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.421 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.122 align:middle line:84%
What's happening more
and more is that,

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:90%
people are developing plans,

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
where the revenue is really will
be shared everybody is going

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.296 align:middle line:84%
to win from it, by
access to the technology

00:17:44.296 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
or by direct investment in
it or by the manufacturing

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.501 align:middle line:90%
and distribution and so forth.

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.538 align:middle line:84%
Really looking at a
whole new paradigm in a--

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:57.076 align:middle line:90%
in dispersed and just types

00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:00.746 align:middle line:84%
of business plans not just
the energy itself being free.

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are the
ones that are upbringings

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.718 align:middle line:90%
of really good solutions out.

00:18:05.718 --> 00:18:09.688 align:middle line:84%
What do they have or what are
their way of being or thriving

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.991 align:middle line:84%
in that and bringing
out this free energy.

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:13.259 align:middle line:90%
Because I guess, a lot

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.328 align:middle line:84%
of inventors do have
an ego, I'm sure.

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:18.864 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about them
or their invention, right.

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.899 align:middle line:84%
This is really at a
whole other scale.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:23.168 align:middle line:84%
So, is there some--
some things that you see

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that those good inventors have
within them, or that seen?

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.141 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: That's a great question.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:31.577 align:middle line:84%
I would say the main
thing is humility.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:37.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean I-- I have spent a lot of
my life with unusual thinkers,

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
let's say, on a lot of kind
of mad scientist types,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.023 align:middle line:84%
who I absolutely love
hanging out with.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.893 align:middle line:84%
But very often, they've spent
so much time in the lab and out

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.797 align:middle line:84%
so far in a particular direction
that they don't have any sense

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:52.831 align:middle line:90%
of how to do a business.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.199 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any
sense of security.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:56.468 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- often times
don't even have much

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.537 align:middle line:90%
in terms of social skills.

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:01.607 align:middle line:84%
But they usually have a very
deep spiritual connection

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:04.276 align:middle line:84%
and that's very often why
they're getting this type

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.377 align:middle line:90%
of guidance.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:06.912 align:middle line:84%
So all they're looking
for is collaboration

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:09.915 align:middle line:84%
that they can trust, now I
know I visited one lab a couple

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.552 align:middle line:84%
of months ago that was the most
inspiring one I've ever been to.

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:17.823 align:middle line:84%
Where they started out with
six scientists under one roof

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.359 align:middle line:84%
and they've expanded
it to 30 now.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:23.262 align:middle line:84%
And they have significant
funding and their--

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.665 align:middle line:84%
the business is setup
so that they all benefit

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:28.300 align:middle line:90%
from anyone's success.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.936 align:middle line:84%
So rather than everybody staying
in their own little cubicle

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:33.972 align:middle line:84%
and not sharing this,
they're all collaborating

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:34.807 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.241 align:middle line:90%
And I saw one project that was--

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.877 align:middle line:84%
had been scheduled for
a year and half of R&D.

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:40.713 align:middle line:90%
They completed it in two months

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:45.517 align:middle line:84%
because different inventors
know different things.

00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.686 align:middle line:84%
And when you run across a
problem, instead of having

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:52.124 align:middle line:84%
to solve that problem yourself,
if you got 29 other inventors,

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:54.526 align:middle line:84%
there's a good chance someone
else knows how to do this.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's happening in
that lab and as I've gone around

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:84%
and been welcomed
fortunately into so many labs.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:05.437 align:middle line:84%
I get to see that lab
number 1, has A and B

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:10.442 align:middle line:84%
and they need C. Lab number 2
over here has B and C already,

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.911 align:middle line:84%
and they need D. And then
there's another one over there

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.849 align:middle line:84%
with D, E and F. And so what's
happening in our culture

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:21.086 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness and in the
world of energy invention is

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:23.922 align:middle line:84%
that people are starting to
find people that they can trust

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:25.858 align:middle line:90%
and starting to collaborate.

00:20:25.858 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the breakthroughs
are coming much faster

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.663 align:middle line:84%
and it's starting to come
out as interindependent

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:35.334 align:middle line:84%
but interrelated teams
rather than just isolated,

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.002 align:middle line:90%
you know, vulnerable geniuses.

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:38.737 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So applicable
to so many fields.

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:39.938 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Exactly, yeah.

00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:42.074 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing the same
thing in agriculture.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.878 align:middle line:84%
You know, this one guy who wrote
me, even worked for a decade

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:49.581 align:middle line:84%
on creating a new
type of agriculture

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:53.652 align:middle line:84%
where the plants need a
third of the resources

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.755 align:middle line:84%
that the plants would've
taken in a normal situation

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.791 align:middle line:90%
and produce twice the yield.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:00.459 align:middle line:90%
Well, he was naive.

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:02.861 align:middle line:84%
He even invited a venture
capital company to come in

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and look as bunch of that--

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, big bankers
from the east coast--

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You're going to
see something else faster--

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.638 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:14.773 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: And so they looked at it.

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.141 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said
to the other, "Oh,

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:18.077 align:middle line:84%
the big boys aren't
going to like this."

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:84%
At which point the
guys started to think,

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:21.413 align:middle line:84%
may be he was talking
to the wrong people.

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:23.415 align:middle line:84%
And they-- so they kind
of went off and had powwow

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:25.918 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "Well, no
sorry we're not interested."

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.754 align:middle line:84%
A week later, he comes
back, he's lives on a farm,

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.089 align:middle line:84%
he comes back in
driving in his driveway

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.491 align:middle line:90%
and he sees two guys in suits.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Jump out of he's
greenhouse, jumping a,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.696 align:middle line:90%
you know, 4 by 4 and take off.

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:40.165 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure they
will see their version

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:90%
of that technology around soon.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.403 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing is
happening in each field

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.972 align:middle line:84%
that these brilliant
inventors are coming

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.876 align:middle line:84%
through with these concepts
that are aligned with nature.

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:90%
They're simple.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.078 align:middle line:90%
They're elegant.

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:90%
They're harmonious.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And they end up being
healthy and productive,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.319 align:middle line:90%
you know, prosperous as well.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:05.157 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's in the way
is the stifling by these powers

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:08.227 align:middle line:84%
that want to, you know,
control everybody's lives

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:11.063 align:middle line:90%
and maintain there old interest.

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:14.533 align:middle line:84%
But that I assure you
is coming down also.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:18.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How about even
regarding the GMOs and the seeds

00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:21.907 align:middle line:84%
and I've been to know each, so
this big seed bank or at least

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
in Oslo to speak
with these people.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.513 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us were
wondering what's really going

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:29.281 align:middle line:84%
on up there 'cause even
when speaking to them,

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:30.816 align:middle line:90%
they don't know say of course.

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:33.652 align:middle line:84%
But how do you even
find solution to that?

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:36.588 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Well, you probably
read that in Hungary,

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:39.491 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, where
they have banned GMOs

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:40.893 align:middle line:90%
from the entire country.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:45.164 align:middle line:84%
They've found a secret field, 55
hectares or something like that

00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:90%
of GMO Monsanto sugar beets.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.737 align:middle line:84%
So the people just come in and
set fire to the entire field.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.038 align:middle line:84%
Their message was
jut very clear.

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.373 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, we meant it,

00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.309 align:middle line:84%
no GMOs because they're aware
not only the health issues

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:58.644 align:middle line:90%
but of the contamination.

00:22:58.644 --> 00:23:00.712 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a-- there's a
crossing point where it's hard

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:03.849 align:middle line:84%
to get back from fields
that are contaminated.

00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:06.618 align:middle line:84%
Same thing just happened
up in Oregon as well.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:08.487 align:middle line:84%
So people are catching
on to that and they--

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
if you stop and look the same
entities many times the Gates

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.165 align:middle line:84%
Foundations, Syngenta, Monsanto
are both pushing really hard

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:23.502 align:middle line:84%
on the complete take over
of agriculture spent.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:27.172 align:middle line:84%
Not only in the US but
they're being fought off pretty

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.674 align:middle line:90%
effectively in Europe.

00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:30.442 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Europe.

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:32.945 align:middle line:84%
But they're really going to
heavily in Africa, trying to get

00:23:32.945 --> 00:23:35.347 align:middle line:90%
into South America and so forth.

00:23:35.347 --> 00:23:37.482 align:middle line:84%
So they're pushing
these dangerous things

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:41.587 align:middle line:84%
which make people and
animals sick, dead, infertile.

00:23:41.587 --> 00:23:43.922 align:middle line:84%
While at the same
time funding these,

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:46.291 align:middle line:84%
what they call this
dooms day seed vault

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:49.294 align:middle line:90%
in Svalbard in Norway.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:53.265 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't make any
sense until you recognize

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.334 align:middle line:84%
that there're two
different agendas going on.

00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling the
public you need GMOs.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.005 align:middle line:90%
Meanwhile for themselves,

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.642 align:middle line:84%
they're hoarding the healthy
seeds, the organic seeds

00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.477 align:middle line:84%
which I think they plan
on bringing out later

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:07.346 align:middle line:90%
on after they've depopulated.

00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:09.781 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It is for corporation
as you clearly said to me

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:90%
that these were for corporation

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.919 align:middle line:84%
and in fact individuals
didn't leave them in there.

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.354 align:middle line:90%
Not small amounts.

00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:16.488 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Well in the UK,

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.056 align:middle line:84%
I just read an article
a couple of days ago.

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:21.426 align:middle line:84%
In the UK they-- in
the government now,

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:26.732 align:middle line:84%
they have created a ban on
GMO foods in the restaurants

00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:28.066 align:middle line:90%
in the government buildings.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:29.334 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile our government
is trying

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:32.137 align:middle line:84%
to push GMO crops
on their people.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So once again, if
you put on the lens

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:84%
of the global domination agenda
horrifying as it is it helps

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:41.146 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish between
what's being said

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.649 align:middle line:84%
and what's actually
being done and why.

00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:47.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you're clearly--
your big thing is free energy

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:50.822 align:middle line:84%
but there is some-- there is
so many different solutions

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.257 align:middle line:90%
out there and other inventors.

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:54.426 align:middle line:84%
Are there some other
things that you found about

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:57.095 align:middle line:84%
and that you really care
for saying or mentioning?

00:24:57.095 --> 00:24:59.865 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Yeah, my big thing is
not necessarily free energy,

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.066 align:middle line:90%
though I'm really enthusiastic.

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.402 align:middle line:90%
My big thing is wholeness.

00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:09.941 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the words
in healing wholeness, holiness,

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
they all come from
the same root.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.578 align:middle line:84%
And it all has to
do with integrity

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:16.415 align:middle line:84%
which is maintaining the
wholeness of a system, you know,

00:25:16.415 --> 00:25:20.519 align:middle line:84%
if a lightning storm comes along
and knocks a branch of a tree.

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.021 align:middle line:84%
There's a wound in that
tree, just like in your body

00:25:23.021 --> 00:25:26.224 align:middle line:84%
and your body and the tree
know how to heal that wound.

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:28.327 align:middle line:84%
We are already programmed
for wholeness,

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:31.029 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
allows life to go forward.

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:34.399 align:middle line:84%
So what we've found is in
all of the different sectors,

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:38.236 align:middle line:84%
whether its environment or
education or media, arts,

00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:42.674 align:middle line:84%
spirituality, food,
whatever it is, energy.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.744 align:middle line:84%
The key is to honor the
wholeness of a system.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.447 align:middle line:84%
And that's represented
by the toroidal dynamic

00:25:48.447 --> 00:25:52.284 align:middle line:84%
because that's how wholeness
creates itself in nature,

00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:55.187 align:middle line:84%
but it's still open to allowing
energy to come into the system,

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:57.556 align:middle line:84%
nurture the system,
and go back out again.

00:25:57.556 --> 00:26:01.126 align:middle line:84%
You and I are each big physical
torus as well as energy torus.

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:04.796 align:middle line:84%
So as every seed that we eat, so
as every tree and every plant,

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:08.633 align:middle line:84%
the planet we live on, the
solar system, the galaxy.

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:12.571 align:middle line:84%
We're just embedded in this
sea of toroidal dynamics.

00:26:12.571 --> 00:26:14.673 align:middle line:84%
So what we're encouraging
people to do,

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:18.477 align:middle line:84%
as they go after all these--
you know, over 120 issues,

00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:20.345 align:middle line:90%
is look to see what would

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.247 align:middle line:84%
that system look
like when it's whole?

00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:25.283 align:middle line:84%
What is a-- What is an
honest currency look like?

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:29.654 align:middle line:84%
What does a healthy
ecosystem look like?

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:32.357 align:middle line:84%
What is an honest
media system look like?

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:34.993 align:middle line:90%
And then see what's in the way.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:38.296 align:middle line:84%
Get the story, do the science,
do the investigative report,

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:41.767 align:middle line:84%
whatever it takes to tell
the story of the deception

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:44.536 align:middle line:84%
and distraction that's going
on in the way of the wholeness.

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:47.539 align:middle line:84%
Once you do that, there's a
lot of media now in the earth

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:49.708 align:middle line:84%
that will cover that,
even mainstream media

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
if the story is compelling
enough.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And once you expose that
in bringing the solution

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.118 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, which is
a healthy currency is an

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:01.253 align:middle line:90%
honest currency.

00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:02.554 align:middle line:84%
Now that's actually
backed by something

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:03.989 align:middle line:90%
of value, that's transparent.

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.057 align:middle line:90%
That no one gets to control.

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:10.295 align:middle line:84%
A healthy ecosystem is one where
you allow the balance of plants

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.864 align:middle line:84%
and birds and bugs and
human beings and all--

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:14.666 align:middle line:84%
where you allow that
to continue.

00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:18.737 align:middle line:84%
And you don't poison the water,
you don't poison the plants,

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.672 align:middle line:90%
you don't poison the air.

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.908 align:middle line:84%
So that critical
thinking can be applied

00:27:22.908 --> 00:27:24.709 align:middle line:90%
to every single issue with God.

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:29.648 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that horrifying
as the number of issues are,

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:32.551 align:middle line:84%
they're mostly created by a
very small group of people

00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.586 align:middle line:90%
and they're all human made.

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:36.454 align:middle line:90%
We don't have a giant comet

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
and coming toward the
planet as far as we know.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.192 align:middle line:90%
That would be a serious problem

00:27:40.192 --> 00:27:41.893 align:middle line:84%
for which we don't
have an answer.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:43.829 align:middle line:84%
But all of these
problems are human made,

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:45.897 align:middle line:84%
the economic problems, the
environmental problems.

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:48.133 align:middle line:84%
So they can be human
fixed if we wake up.

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.435 align:middle line:84%
Follow this sort of
model and get on it now,

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:51.803 align:middle line:90%
which people are doing.

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:54.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I heard also
of some of the solutions

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:57.142 align:middle line:84%
of this government,
whatever, we're also received

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:59.344 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
beings though.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.781 align:middle line:84%
Like they have received some
technology that we're not so--

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.583 align:middle line:90%
so they're not all human made.

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.919 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess there are some
good and bad ones there too, no?

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.554 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Well, it's a very
interesting question

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:12.991 align:middle line:84%
which I can't confirm absolutely
myself but I have, you know,

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:15.126 align:middle line:84%
high level of contacts
including, you know,

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:17.429 align:middle line:84%
whistleblowers from
Area 51 and so forth

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:19.865 align:middle line:84%
that had been educating
me a lot.

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:24.936 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, the extraterrestrials
apparently have been sharing

00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:27.339 align:middle line:84%
advance technology
sometimes in refer--

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:33.211 align:middle line:84%
in trade for the ability
to manipulate some people

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.713 align:middle line:84%
or some parts of
the environment.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:37.582 align:middle line:84%
You just take some of resources
or whatever from this planet.

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:39.851 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be very
careful about that,

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:44.823 align:middle line:84%
because a species is
technologically advanced enough

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:48.226 align:middle line:84%
to get here from another
solar system, doesn't mean

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:50.762 align:middle line:84%
that we need to give up
our sovereignty to them

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.198 align:middle line:84%
or that we need to
do backdoor deals

00:28:53.198 --> 00:28:57.636 align:middle line:84%
that affect other human beings
without them being consulted.

00:28:57.636 --> 00:29:00.138 align:middle line:84%
My impression is, you know,
I went from, you know,

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:03.241 align:middle line:84%
early on my life, recognize
there's got to be, you know,

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:07.479 align:middle line:84%
a sanctioned life in the
universe this size besides us

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:10.515 align:middle line:84%
to recognizing that, yes, we've
been visited for millennia

00:29:10.515 --> 00:29:14.719 align:middle line:84%
by all sorts of different ships
and so forth, to realizing

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:17.489 align:middle line:84%
that we're continuing
to be visited by many,

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:20.625 align:middle line:84%
many different species,
five or six primary ones.

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:24.129 align:middle line:84%
But multiple different species,
each with different agendas

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:26.364 align:middle line:90%
and that ultimately come back

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:28.967 align:middle line:84%
to where we're probably
living in the Star Wars bar.

00:29:28.967 --> 00:29:31.803 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to become more
and more obvious, some of them

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:35.874 align:middle line:84%
in the grounds, some them off
the earth, some of them are

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:38.977 align:middle line:84%
in realms of vibration
that we can't see or hear.

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.578 align:middle line:84%
But often times their
communication

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.113 align:middle line:90%
with us is telepathic.

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:46.051 align:middle line:84%
Often times they-- you
know, the inner guidance

00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:48.386 align:middle line:84%
that we get maybe coming
from more advance species

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:50.755 align:middle line:84%
which are looking to
help to protect the earth

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:53.358 align:middle line:84%
so we don't blow ourselves
up with nuclear weapons

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:57.529 align:middle line:84%
or poison the earth the
way that we're doing now.

00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:01.366 align:middle line:84%
But I think that ultimately the
relations, even if they're not

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:05.136 align:middle line:84%
so called human relations,
the relations whether its

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:08.606 align:middle line:84%
with the plants and
threes or with the insects

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and the animals, or with
entities from beyond our planet,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.880 align:middle line:84%
it's always a matter of
honoring the wholeness of each

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.117 align:middle line:84%
of our being and then
doing voluntary exchange

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:22.954 align:middle line:84%
and association rather than any
coercion or subjugation at all.

00:30:22.954 --> 00:30:26.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I have question
regarding what makes a movement,

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
'cause I saw one of these books,
there are so many books here.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:31.529 align:middle line:84%
But there are some about
what makes a movement thrive

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:34.332 align:middle line:84%
or happen and another
that doesn't, you know,

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:37.235 align:middle line:84%
what's your sense here of--
because this is a real movement,

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:41.373 align:middle line:84%
Thrive Movement, what can
we get successful versus not

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:44.809 align:middle line:84%
with all the solutions, all
these people, all these website?

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.878 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Well, Kimberly and
I believed that the key

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:50.782 align:middle line:84%
to a success movement is
basing it on natural principles

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:53.518 align:middle line:84%
that honor the sanctity
of every being,

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:59.758 align:middle line:84%
and then empowering people
and self creating movements

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:02.594 align:middle line:84%
without creating any
new violations at all.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to
be very effective.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.999 align:middle line:84%
We're not out to tell
anybody what to do.

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:11.102 align:middle line:84%
We're not out to control
some large organization.

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.304 align:middle line:84%
We're doing just the opposite,
I mean people are call--

00:31:13.304 --> 00:31:15.807 align:middle line:84%
you know, writing everyday,
saying "Oh, what can I do?"

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And basically we write back
and say, here's, you know,

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.779 align:middle line:84%
just an infinite selection
of things that can do,

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:24.049 align:middle line:84%
but first look into your heart,
find out what your purpose

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:26.785 align:middle line:90%
and joy is and then write to us

00:31:26.785 --> 00:31:28.153 align:middle line:84%
and let us know what
you're doing.

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:32.957 align:middle line:84%
Find people in your area of
interest or in your local region

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.826 align:middle line:90%
and then initiate your projects.

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:37.729 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'll just all keep
in communication with each other

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.732 align:middle line:84%
about what's working and
what's not, rather than try to,

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.934 align:middle line:84%
have any centralized
control over any of it.

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:47.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So it's not anymore
perimetral, it's more like flat.

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.606 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: Yeah.

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.342 align:middle line:84%
It's like a whole archaical,
the evolution of biology

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
as we're talking
about whole ones

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.746 align:middle line:84%
and a wholearchy [phonetic],
where, you know, when I talked

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:57.148 align:middle line:84%
about these toruses
from the atom level

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.783 align:middle line:90%
to the galactic level.

00:31:58.783 --> 00:32:01.419 align:middle line:84%
We are also somewhere
in that wholearchy.

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.856 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so much a hierarchy,
certainly not a command

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.724 align:middle line:90%
and control hierarchy.

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:09.894 align:middle line:84%
But we recognize that each of us
is embedded in a larger system

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:12.263 align:middle line:84%
and we have other systems
embedded within us.

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:14.966 align:middle line:84%
And if we treat all of
that with awareness,

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:19.604 align:middle line:84%
with honoring the
wholeness and with the sense

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that in spirit we're all one,
seems to work out consistently.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And they could
know the-- how could the--

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:32.517 align:middle line:84%
what could be some of the
reason to why, it would--

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:35.753 align:middle line:84%
it could fell, you know, what
are some things to watch for?

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.122 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: That's a great question.

00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:41.059 align:middle line:84%
The main reason we see why it
fails is, when first of all

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:42.994 align:middle line:90%
if people try to control others.

00:32:42.994 --> 00:32:45.964 align:middle line:84%
Secondly-- And that
leads to decision making.

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Decision making is absolute
critical, you know, from a--

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.302 align:middle line:84%
within inside yourself,
to a couple, to a family,

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:53.905 align:middle line:84%
to an activist group, to
a corporation, whatever.

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:57.008 align:middle line:84%
It always comes down to
decision making and that's

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:90%
where conflict tends to arise.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:04.048 align:middle line:84%
So if you have decision making
practices based on solid,

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.284 align:middle line:84%
just principles,
that really helps.

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.219 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to have
dissension now and then.

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:10.855 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have at least
some people in the group

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.891 align:middle line:84%
who are very skilled
in conflict resolution,

00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:14.859 align:middle line:90%
harmonious conflict resolution.

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:19.297 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately, the group
needs to be sufficiently aligned

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:21.499 align:middle line:84%
on its purpose and
mission that you--

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:22.967 align:middle line:84%
when you have difficult
decisions,

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.502 align:middle line:90%
you can go back to the mission.

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:28.406 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just someone exerts
their power, or flip a coin

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:30.842 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
you go, "Oh wait a minute,

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.444 align:middle line:84%
let's see why we got
together in the first place,

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.747 align:middle line:84%
and see what decision,
best matches that.

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:39.384 align:middle line:84%
So those are some of the, the
key elements that we're looking

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:43.354 align:middle line:84%
to empower people with, as they
form groups around the world.

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:45.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there some
other things to say here,

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:46.925 align:middle line:84%
as we're speaking
of solutions to,

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:50.395 align:middle line:84%
so that whole civilization
thrives?

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:53.231 align:middle line:84%
>> FG: Well, one really
good piece of news is

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:56.234 align:middle line:84%
that most people have been
so trained into scarcity

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:58.836 align:middle line:84%
that they think there isn't
enough money to go around.

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:01.172 align:middle line:84%
There is plenty of
money to go around,

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:04.976 align:middle line:84%
it's just been consolidating
into the hands of the very few.

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.779 align:middle line:84%
And, we outlined very
briefly in the movie

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:10.782 align:middle line:84%
that if we simply cut the
American military budget

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:13.284 align:middle line:84%
in half, it would still be as
big as essentially the rest

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.319 align:middle line:90%
of the world combined.

00:34:14.319 --> 00:34:16.487 align:middle line:84%
So it's clearly not
a defense budget,

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:90%
it's an imperialist budget.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.059 align:middle line:84%
If we cut that in
half, we would fine.

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:23.561 align:middle line:84%
And then if you get rid
of the Federal Reserve,

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:26.898 align:middle line:84%
which is just this fake
money printing, banking scam.

00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:35.038 align:middle line:84%
Then that freeze up over
1.3 trillion dollars a year.

00:34:35.038 --> 00:34:39.544 align:middle line:90%
And there was a study done, by--

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:44.015 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the Wordwatch
Institute, that they predicted

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:48.186 align:middle line:84%
that to solve all of the world's
basic problems of poverty,

00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:51.322 align:middle line:90%
justice, health and environment,

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:54.759 align:middle line:84%
would take about 190
billion dollars a year.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:58.563 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're talking about 1.3
trillion dollar being freed

00:34:58.563 --> 00:35:00.298 align:middle line:90%
up just in the US.

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:84%
And that's before bringing
in free energy, honest money,

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.702 align:middle line:90%
all that kind of stuff.

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:07.639 align:middle line:84%
There's more than enough money
just in reforming what's going

00:35:07.639 --> 00:35:10.208 align:middle line:84%
on in the US to heal
the entire world.

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:13.244 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
looking at that happening

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.281 align:middle line:84%
in all the countries, it's
going-- the money situation,

00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
the resource situation is
going to be like free energy.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.353 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty and more
to go around as long

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:24.956 align:middle line:84%
as we honor natural
principles and the sovereignty

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.658 align:middle line:90%
and sanctity of one another.

00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:29.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Foster Gamble,
president, president.

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:32.397 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: No politics, thank you.

00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:34.899 align:middle line:84%
You see that's the source of the
problem in the first-- that was.

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.835 align:middle line:84%
I was actually asked to
run for the vice president

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:90%
on the Green Party Ticket.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.474 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm really honored
and flattered by the offer.

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But go-- look at the
end of the movie again

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.514 align:middle line:84%
because in my opinion
the most dangerous thing

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:52.617 align:middle line:84%
on the planet right now is
this belief that we need

00:35:52.617 --> 00:35:54.852 align:middle line:90%
to be governed by somebody else.

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:57.755 align:middle line:84%
If you look-- the evidence
is obvious that the idea

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.590 align:middle line:90%
of the state, the course

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.761 align:middle line:84%
of state is the most destructive
concept in human history

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:07.765 align:middle line:84%
by far is now surpassed the
church in terms of the death

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:11.035 align:middle line:84%
and destruction and
continues at a rapid pace.

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:13.237 align:middle line:90%
But we're also trained that--

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:16.007 align:middle line:84%
oh now you look and see
how do they doing in terms

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.075 align:middle line:90%
of running organizations?

00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:19.677 align:middle line:84%
Well, the US is the
most indebted entity

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.046 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the planet.

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So the track record for central
government is not great and

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.489 align:middle line:84%
yet you and I and
virtually everyone else

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:34.058 align:middle line:84%
that I know has been
indoctrinated literally

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:90%
since elementary school.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.395 align:middle line:90%
To think that well, you know,

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
debt and taxes are the only
things that are certain.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.132 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to pay
your taxes 'cause we have

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:43.801 align:middle line:84%
to have a government because
otherwise everything would

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.436 align:middle line:90%
be chaos.

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.705 align:middle line:84%
And in fact we need
to reinspect that one.

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:51.542 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the last seven years
studying this more intensely

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.944 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:56.013 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you the news is
as good as when I found aikido

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.482 align:middle line:84%
and realized that
you could be strong

00:36:57.482 --> 00:36:58.616 align:middle line:90%
in gentle at the same time.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.151 align:middle line:84%
In fact the more
general you were,

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.252 align:middle line:90%
the more stronger you could be

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:03.955 align:middle line:84%
into protecting yourself
in your loved ones.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.923 align:middle line:84%
The same principle is
applied in free energy.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:09.327 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're not crushing
at or burning at or whatever

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.029 align:middle line:90%
as long as you honor the flow,

00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:84%
you got into the
energy available.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.067 align:middle line:84%
The third big discovery
of my life was this whole

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.436 align:middle line:90%
like cruel liberty conversation.

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:24.308 align:middle line:84%
Where it brings up the point,
the fundamental moral question

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:27.645 align:middle line:84%
at one point-- at one point
is it OK for you or me

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:30.982 align:middle line:84%
to go violate someone else or
for someone else to violate you.

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:34.018 align:middle line:84%
And most people say to me
well that's a trick question.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:90%
We can't really answer that.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.389 align:middle line:84%
I said no, I think it's
the one we need to answer.

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:40.825 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- and of course,
everyone gets, well, you know,

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:43.294 align:middle line:84%
the golden rule and you
shouldn't violate other people.

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.829 align:middle line:84%
But then you turn
right around say, well,

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.197 align:middle line:84%
of course we have
to have government.

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.466 align:middle line:84%
Every government by
definition depends

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:52.103 align:middle line:84%
on involuntary taxation
to survive.

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.771 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to come
take your money whether you

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.006 align:middle line:90%
like it or not.

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:56.507 align:middle line:90%
And if you say, "No, I don't--

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:59.243 align:middle line:84%
I didn't agree to that they're
going to pull out a gun,

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.945 align:middle line:84%
they're going to take you
off and put you on the cage.

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:02.346 align:middle line:90%
Or shoot you or something.

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:05.616 align:middle line:84%
And that's the violence on
which our civilization is based.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.518 align:middle line:90%
And until we recognized that

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:11.923 align:middle line:84%
and really start exploring the
alternatives of how a society

00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:15.326 align:middle line:84%
with rules about non-violation,
protection of the environment,

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.228 align:middle line:90%
so were-- the rules are there

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:84%
but they're independent
justice organizations

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:23.401 align:middle line:84%
and independent business
transactions and so forth.

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:26.604 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that that's much
more successful throughout

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:29.407 align:middle line:84%
history whenever it's
allowed to exist.

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.909 align:middle line:84%
And the track record of
the state just always leads

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.311 align:middle line:90%
to tyranny and violence.

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:34.712 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, one
of the things

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:37.381 align:middle line:84%
that gives me most hope is I
know that there's a way out.

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:38.783 align:middle line:90%
But I think this is going

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.785 align:middle line:84%
to be the primary thing I'll be
involve in the rest of my life.

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:44.422 align:middle line:84%
Even now beyond free energy and
reform in the economic system

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and everything, this
whole notion

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.127 align:middle line:84%
that we each should have
absolutely equal rights,

00:38:49.127 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
true liberty and justice for
all 'cause we're not there yet,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.101 align:middle line:84%
I think is the key to humanity
surviving and thriving.

00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:01.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you so much
for this amazing conversation.

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.707 align:middle line:90%
I really, really enjoyed it.

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:05.543 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an honor to be
interviewing you today here

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.478 align:middle line:90%
in front of all those books.

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:10.014 align:middle line:84%
My goodness there's a
lot of knowledge here.

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:12.183 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for putting
your mind at this

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.218 align:middle line:84%
and your heart because
that counts.

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> FG: You are welcome, Lilou.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.689 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for what you
do to get to speak with people

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:21.559 align:middle line:84%
like you and the people in your
network about these issues.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.062 align:middle line:84%
It inspires me and I look
forward to future collaborations

00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:28.332 align:middle line:84%
with those of you
who feel called to.

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Background Music]
Big, big kisses to all of you.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.369 align:middle line:90%
Gosh! This is good.

00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Big kisses bye.
