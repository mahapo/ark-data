00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here on the road in
beautiful sunny Miami Beach,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:90%
South Beach on Ocean Drive.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.524 align:middle line:84%
How does it get any
better than that, Frank?

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:28.814 align:middle line:90%
>> FRANK KINSLOW: Love it here.

00:00:28.814 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Just absolutely love it.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's so
beautiful to me.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I just flew in, you know,
to do these interviews,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
with you included,
here in Florida.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was very cold
in Europe, so I'm just

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
thrilled to be
sitting here outside

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and have another delicious
conversation, a conversation

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
that inspires us, that moves us.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:90%
You have quite a story.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
You used to be a
former chiropractor.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back, actually,
all the way into your 20s

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:90%
and what really went on.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.752 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
meditating for quite a while.

00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yeah.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.749 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, let's go
back further than that,

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.197 align:middle line:90%
since you started it.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: OK.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: When I was 8,
9, and 10, I lived in Japan,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and I took Judo.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And there it's really
more like a way of life.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a sport, but
it's a way of life.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And we went every day.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I worked myself up
to the best in the class,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
but I was American and
bigger and stronger

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:90%
than the kids my age.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day I showed up,
and there was a little guy.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'd never seen him before.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And sensei says, randori.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
You do a little practice there.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, in my mind,
I'm going to take this guy,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to do tomoe nage.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an intricate move, throw
him through the paper window

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
out into the courtyard.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:90%
This is a macho kind of a thing.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And really, all I remember
from about the 10 minutes

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that we practiced together
was seeing the ceiling,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
as he kept throwing
me and throwing.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Every time I'd get up, boom.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was humiliated.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I was frustrated.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:90%
I was angry.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:90%
I was embarrassed.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And I went home that night.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go back.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I told my father I
didn't want Judo anymore.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you go back.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I went there.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.305 align:middle line:84%
And that kid wasn't
there anymore.

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I found out that he
was six years old.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where he came from,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
but I have a feeling he came
in to sort of neutralize

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.730 align:middle line:84%
these over-inflated egos
that happened to be around.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And that day when I was
sitting there when I came back,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I was just very
embarrassed and a lot

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
of the emotions mix going on.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And as I sat there, sensei
taught us the belly water

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a mind over
matter technique.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
doing that technique,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
all of those negative
emotions just washed away.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And then I became stronger.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I became more in harmony.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that, right away, that
was a pivot point for me.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're 8, 9, and 10,
we're learning how to control.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We're learning how
to become adults,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
moving away from childhood
where we're spontaneous

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and we just love being
timeless and in the moment.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
We learn how to
structure our lives.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And this was a destructuring.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And that was a guiding
point in my life, actually

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:84%
all through my teens, my young
adulthood for at least 40 years

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
with the various
practices that I taught.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I spent many years studying
esoteric techniques.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I accumulated
up to almost three years

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
of silent meditation, meditating
for months on end all day,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And my activity,
meditation techniques,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:84%
lasted for 2 and 1/2 hours
every day, very dedicated.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: I'm
going to get there.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be enlightened.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.315 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be at peace,
come hell or high water.

00:04:05.315 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.347 align:middle line:84%
But that's usually doesn't
work when we're meditating--

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
does it?-- and we want
absolutely to do something.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Or even in life in
general, a lot of teachers

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
speak of this letting go, of
being in the present moment.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.935 align:middle line:90%
What is your view on that?

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well,
that's exactly right.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
After all of this-- and
I had great experiences.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And I began teaching, and my
students had great experiences.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But at one point in my
life, I said, you know,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:90%
something here is not right.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:90%
There's something missing.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.102 align:middle line:84%
I've done 40 years
of meditation,

00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I've dedicated myself to this,
and I'm still not at peace.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.925 align:middle line:84%
And so I started throwing out
in my life what didn't work.

00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Such as?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Oh,
well, my practice.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I was a chiropractor
at that time.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I also had a degree
in teaching the deaf.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:90%
I just threw that out.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I threw out all my relationships
that weren't working, basically

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
They were based on
the wrong things.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.125 align:middle line:84%
I moved from
Michigan to Florida.

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What a
great state, Michigan.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.304 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: It is a
fantastic state, yeah.

00:05:12.304 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:90%
You got to be hardy, though.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The weather didn't
agree with me.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I love it here.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And make a long story
short, because it

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.720 align:middle line:84%
took about seven years, I ended
up throwing everything out.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: How were you making
your decisions, based on what?

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Your happiness level?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:90%
Your inner peace?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: In what
I had done before.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what had happened
is I noticed a pattern

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that every time I reached
a point of discomfort

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and I felt uncomfortable inside,
I wouldn't know what to do,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:90%
and I'd stop.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd start
doing something new.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what we all do.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But it was the stopping
that felt good.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't the doing.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The doing was the excitement,
because you had hope

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
because something in the
future was coming, right?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But then when you got
there, it was never as great

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.182 align:middle line:90%
as you thought.

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Where was this enlightenment?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Where was this inner
peace 24 hours a day?

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Where were the angels?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, during my trek
over those many years, decades,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I did learn to hang out with
the angels and disincarnate

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.903 align:middle line:84%
masters, all of
those flashy things.

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But they're just
different realms.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They're just different
levels of life.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really give
you the inner essence,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
the fullness that
we humans need.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to converse
with any level of life fully.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But that means also
being one with ourself.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.109 align:middle line:84%
You hear that all the time,
but what does that mean?

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because we're
incarnated beings, right?

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We are human beings
on Earth, and it

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
is important to fully descend
here too on the planet

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
as much as being with
this invisible realm.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well, it's the angel
that looks down on us and says,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
what is this human thing?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They have phlegm and gas
and their stomachs gurgle,

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:84%
but they're capable
of experiencing

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.817 align:middle line:84%
the fullest in creation,
the oneness that's there.

00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You think
they say that, actually,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to
experience the fullness?

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems sometimes,
because we're in this envelope,

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
we can't.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Don't kid yourself.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
It is because of that.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
What does an angel
know of suffering?

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But now we know what
it's like to suffer.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
We know what it is to drag
this body around with us.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And we also know, if
we're lucky-- I don't

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
want to say lucky,
but if we stop.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll develop that in
just a moment-- once we

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
stop trying to get
somewhere, all that's left

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
is stillness, which is
peace, which is oneness.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to experience
both, all, the extremes,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
the suffering, the great
suffering, and the fullness

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:90%
and the joy of life.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
now is something

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.720 align:middle line:90%
that angels don't have.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
They really can't
have that fullness,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:90%
that complete fullness.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they're guides
in certain ways.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:90%
But in other ways, we know more.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So after seven years, actually,
of throwing things out,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
what I realized was that every
time I threw something out,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt momentarily at peace,
and then I started up again.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
What happened was when I turned
61, I was deeply in debt.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I had a job that I
made not even enough

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
to pay off the
interest on my loans.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.611 align:middle line:90%
I lost the job.

00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
around and saying,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
here I am worried
about money after all

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of this, quote, "spiritual
training" over all

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:90%
of these years.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with this?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this time I stopped,
and I didn't get started again.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I started just
looking at this fear,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
this fear that I had of money.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the basic
negative emotion.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
from all the others

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
come, jealousy, grief,
greed, all of that.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I started watching the fear
without trying to get rid of it

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
or without trying to move
it and manipulate it.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I just watched it, and
it would dissipate.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
It disappeared.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Pretty
quickly too, no?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.146 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes.

00:09:29.146 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Immediately.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was
immediately I felt the peace

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that I had been
looking-- but now, I

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:90%
had found intermittently.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But now I had it
any time I wanted.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I
realized that as a kid,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.024 align:middle line:84%
that same joy was there when
I was just left on my own.

00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
was happening now.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I really had nowhere to
go and nothing to do.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And instead of trying to
fill that void, I left it.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I found that it
wasn't a void at all,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
that it was filled with
fullness, with this awareness

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that unity exists, that
harmony permeates all things,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:90%
that there is an order.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's not where we're going.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.660 align:middle line:90%
It's where we are that counts.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a philosophy that
has been reflected in many ways.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But the practice
of it, the practice

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of not doing, if you will, even
that traditionally you hear,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.284 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, we're of no mind.

00:10:32.284 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
become the observer.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do you do that?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you do
this, this, and this.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.163 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

00:10:37.163 --> 00:10:39.224 align:middle line:84%
You're doing
something to not do.

00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And then
we can feel it.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
A person that would be
sitting in the position

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.060 align:middle line:84%
of the observer, we're not
connected the same way.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I had this situation
recently in an interview.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It was detached and not present.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: That's
a great perception.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And that really takes us
to the core of my teaching

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is that separation is the first
step, but it's not the end.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
The separation gives
us safety, but it

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
doesn't give us the fullness.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It separates us.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Any time you have two,
you can't have unity,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
unless you see the unity
in all the differences.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is when we
do Quantum Entrainment, which

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:25.275 align:middle line:84%
is the name, the scary
scientific name for a process

00:11:25.275 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
that is very natural
and human and already

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
there-- anyone
viewing this already

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
has everything they need to
experience this unity right

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Now what I found was that
after everything had dissolved

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't try to
make anything come back,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
everything came back but with
the support of the fullness

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
there automatically
without effort.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So all of these tryings going
on and all of that trying,

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:90%
it was just eliminated.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was done on perception.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Now this is very interesting.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
We work our way
through various ways

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:84%
to enlightenment or to
experience inner peace,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
if you will, just to feel
whole, like a whole human being.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:84%
There are five traditional
ways to do that.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:84%
One is through the
heart, devotion.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
One is through the
intellect, advaita.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
One is through
twisting and bending,

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:90%
physical, breathing, yoga.

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:90%
And one is mechanical.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And mechanical would be
doing mantras and yantras

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing, just repetition.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The fifth one is perception,
and that's what I stumbled on.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Perception is there already.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You have everything built
into you as a human being.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you perceive
something, automatically

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:90%
your body and your mind react.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I mean.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:84%
If you were to perceive,
to see, let's say,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
a dog in this street
out here being hit,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:84%
immediately there's
a contraction

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in the body, the
diaphragm, the blood gases

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.714 align:middle line:84%
change, and cardiac output,
and all of that, boom.

00:13:06.714 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And to go along with that
are the negative thoughts,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.379 align:middle line:90%
the stress.

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Now that happened
automatically, didn't it,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you
perceive something?

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Now think about
watching a sunset.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You watch that beautiful
sunset, and all of a sudden

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
the body is relaxed and
the mind is at peace.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's a perception.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to say, OK, now
I'm going to imagine I'm here.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.472 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's like it happens
to us, and we're part of it.

00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yeah.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It really, in essence, can't
happen to us, because it is us.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what we recognize,
that nothing is outside of us.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
When we have two-- now
in the "Bhagavad Gita,"

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
it says fear is born of duality.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean exactly?

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, fear comes when
there are two things.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
that there's me

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.100 align:middle line:84%
and then there's something else,
you have to right away say,

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:90%
is that friend or foe?

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Do I try to assimilate
it and make it help me?

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Or do I push it away
so it can't hurt me?

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you see it as
yourself-- and I don't

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
mean understand it, but when
you perceive it as yourself--

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:90%
the fear goes away.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That still
seems like a concept.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It seems like something still
out there when we think of it.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very special to
be connected as one,

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:90%
to really see and know that.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: It's not special.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:90%
It's uncommon.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
But it is the most
normal and natural state.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And anybody who experiences
it will tell you that.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
It was the most
mundane experience.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I picked up a rock, and
I saw the whole universe

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:90%
in that rock.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.244 align:middle line:84%
And looking back
at it is separate.

00:14:56.244 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
How can you pick up a rock
that's separate from you?

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Where's the universe in it?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.315 align:middle line:84%
And the mind gets
involved, you know?

00:15:01.315 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: But it's not
that kind of thing at all.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It is simple
perception of unity,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:90%
of the oneness that's there.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.864 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take years
of arduous study.

00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It doesn't
happen to us,

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
like those special
moments don't choose us,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:90%
when we look at a stone.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Because how about having
that experience in a conflict

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
or in a situation?

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:90%
That's really when we want it.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to feel
it, and it's going.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It's off-- it goes and--

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Here's the thing.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
If you try to hold onto
it, you're creating a goal.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a
situation where I'm here,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and I want to get there.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Where I am is not good enough.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And so when I get
here, I'll be happy.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It never works.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Where you are, if you are
upset, that's what you are.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.977 align:middle line:90%
There's nowhere to go.

00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what you are.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
My mother died just recently.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I was very close to her,
and I had a great deal

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
of sadness and at the same time
a great deal of joy at this--

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I can't even explain it,
just this great universality.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Like ecstasy, nearly.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Mm hmm.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:09.749 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:90%
The two were together.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I was sad-- when I get
angry, it's the same thing.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of me
that says, look at this.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It's just going on and
there's anger there

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not supposed
to like that.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a judgment.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the judgment says,
oh, yeah, look at me.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm judging.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.850 align:middle line:84%
At first, there's
that separation,

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
realization that the separation

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.159 align:middle line:90%
is two, the witnessing.

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And probably you've had
that experience and maybe

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
some of the viewers,
that when you're

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.660 align:middle line:84%
angry in the middle of it you're
saying, boy, I'm really angry,

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.118 align:middle line:84%
or, oh, I shouldn't
have said that.

00:16:45.118 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
That was stupid.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
But that's that separation.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:90%
You kind of step outside.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't have
to embrace it.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:90%
You perceive the unity in both.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is so easily taught.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, clearing
the mind of thought.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:84%
We're told by so many traditions
that it takes years of practice

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:90%
to clear the mind of thought.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in seconds,
absolutely seconds,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
because nothing is the
foundation for everything

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
else, what I call
pure awareness.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
If you take your hands
and you stretch them out

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
and you look at one
hand and then you

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
look at the other hand then
you say, what was in my mind

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.430 align:middle line:84%
from the time I was looking
at one hand to the other,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
you have to say
nothing was there.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was there in that.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.690 align:middle line:90%
But did I go into a coma?

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.445 align:middle line:90%
Did I disappear?

00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Is something wrong?

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:90%
You are still there.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Your awareness was still active.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
There was just nothing
to be aware of.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Clear the mind of thoughts.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now when we teach people to
experience this inner essence,

00:17:54.260 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
this clarity within them, it's
done in a matter of seconds.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
The thing is here
it's a technique that

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
eliminates itself
as a technique.

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.754 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you get
wrapped up in the doing.

00:18:10.754 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's one of the
questions I had preparing this

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, why then making
it into a technique?

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And also, do all
healers or teachers

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
need to create a
process out of it?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Does it need to
be a step-by-step?

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Is this why--

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: It does because,
to begin with, to hook someone.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I call Quantum
Entrainment a healing technique

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to the general public,
because in seconds to minutes

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:84%
we create healing of arthritis
and emotional concerns and pets

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
The reality is it is
not a healing technique.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique to
experience this inner essence.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to give it a name.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
What we call it in
QE is Eufeeling.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Which is the name of
one of your many, many books,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes, that's right.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Eufeeling is-- you
know we have our heart,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and the heart is open.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.134 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that allows
us to experience life,

00:19:11.134 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say from
an emotional but more

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:90%
from a devotional way.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Eufeeling is the
heart of the heart.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the stillness
within the heart.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
as easy to perceive

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
as looking at an apple
in the palm of your hand.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just that simple
once you know how.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The technique actually
tricks the mind.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we are so used to
going step A, B, C, D, and then

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So I've made it into a
three-step technique.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.309 align:middle line:84%
In essence, what we do
is the first two steps,

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, you do this step,
then you do this step,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden the
third step takes them away,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:90%
so there are no steps left.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And immediately you're there.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.498 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't have to
do the technique anymore

00:19:55.498 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
once you find it.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.835 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: When we speak quantum,
we think of also, let's say--

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I think immediately when you say
that of being within that heart

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.625 align:middle line:84%
right there and being in
that presence ourselves.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Like if our...

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:90%
if our perception or our way...

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:84%
like, we could be
anywhere we want, really,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:90%
even within the body.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.889 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: I'm not quite sure.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We put our
attention right there,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
like if we were in the heart,
and then naturally there is

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.744 align:middle line:90%
this peace that happens.

00:20:29.744 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well,
you can do that.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But see, now you've
got a technique

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.263 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, if I go to
the heart I feel peace.

00:20:34.263 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
But if I go to the
shoulder, what do I feel?

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.876 align:middle line:90%
Peace is there too.

00:20:37.876 --> 00:20:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.804 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Eufeeling is
everywhere all the time.

00:20:41.804 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you should be able to
perceive it in your shoulder.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You should be able to perceive
it in a stone, an apple, OK?

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, it's that simple.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And we do a basic
workshop before we

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.070 align:middle line:84%
break for lunch
people are creating

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
pretty incredible healing
events in perfect strangers,

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:90%
just before we break for lunch.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
It's that natural to the
human being to do this.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
The problem is with most
of us, 98% percent or more

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in this world, is that we're
outward-oriented and/or even

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
inward-oriented when we
should be neither or both.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a quote in "Isha
Upanishad" that says,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
those people who are attached
to the material world,

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.250 align:middle line:90%
they're damned.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They'll never get
to enlightenment.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:90%
They'll never be at peace.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:84%
It says, those people who are
attached to the spiritual world

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%
are doubly damned.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It's harder for them
to experience peace,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're so
attached to this inner.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm the right.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm suffering
because, oh, I'm

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
going through lifetime
and all of this stuff.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.990 align:middle line:84%
They have this construct
that they're stuck on.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we
just wash away all of that,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and we just turn
our awareness-- I

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.402 align:middle line:84%
said, from a dog being hit
in the street to a sunset.

00:21:59.402 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We turn our awareness
to Eufeeling.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.474 align:middle line:90%
It's just that easy.

00:22:02.474 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you how
hard it is to do QE.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Think about a tree.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.621 align:middle line:84%
Then think about
a person you know.

00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.855 align:middle line:84%
How hard was it for you to shift
from the tree to the person?

00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:90%
It was effortless.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just that effortless.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just that natural.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you know where Eufeeling
is, you just shift to it.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing it now.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.215 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:29.205 align:middle line:90%
So tell us more.

00:22:29.205 --> 00:22:30.882 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: [LAUGHS]
By not doing.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:90%
By not trying.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Here, if you want to
be completely still,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the attributes
of the attributeless Eufeeling,

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be completely
still, what do you do?

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to stop
doing to be still.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about peace, oh,
yeah, I'm peaceful, yeah.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's relative
levels of peace,

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
universal peace.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about unbounded
universal peace here,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
not, oh, I'm more
relaxed than when

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm driving the car when
I'm laying on the couch

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.083 align:middle line:90%
or when I'm doing my meditation.

00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You're speaking on
this boundless, unlimited,

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
beautiful-- some people call it
source or love energy or force

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.304 align:middle line:90%
But that flows through us.

00:23:17.304 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: And we're it.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.473 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: And we
have to be careful.

00:23:20.473 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Because if you ask what
the soul is, for instance,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
or if you ask what
vital energy is,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you ask 10 different people, you
get 10 different definitions.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm always real careful
about defining these things.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't define what
has no boundaries,

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
so it's indefinable
to begin with.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's really ridiculous
for me to talk about it,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:90%
but here we are.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Here's a good analogy
to give you an idea.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
When we did the little look
at your hands thing where

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
you look at one and you
find a gap in between,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that pure awareness there, when
I teach this-- and by the way,

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:84%
you can learn this just by
reading one of my books.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It's so natural that you don't
have to go to a workshop.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.090 align:middle line:90%
You can just read the book.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're translated into
so many different languages.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.769 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: What has been the
bestseller of all of them?

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well, the bestseller
is what we call "The Secret

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:90%
of Instant Healing."

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, where
it kicked off, it

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.010 align:middle line:90%
was called "Quantum Healing."

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because it kicked off
really well in Germany, huh?

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes, yes.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:84%
When we published
the book in Germany,

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.852 align:middle line:84%
"Quantum Healing," there was
only one book in their Amazon

00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
dot Germany, there
was only one book

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:90%
with the word quantum in it.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Now there are hundreds,
and it was all

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
based on the success
of this one book.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.105 align:middle line:90%
Germany is a unique country.

00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability
to be very flexible

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and think in the abstract,
yet they're very orderly.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is the coming
together of the two worlds.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:90%
In Japan, it's the other way.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
They're very industrial,
and yet they're

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:84%
very used to being open to
the unbounded, to no mind.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And so QE just fits right into
that philosophy very well.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every
country we've been in,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
unique orientation.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.905 align:middle line:84%
But that's because this
perception is not Frank's.

00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It is simply that
I discovered a way

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to cut through all of
the years of training

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to simply experience
what is your essence.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because it's pretty
cool to go from chiropractic--

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and I interview so many
former chiropractors.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
This is so common, it
seems, for chiropractors

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to go into this healing,
whatever the technique is.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about this shift.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
You talked about it, that you
made this shift, but shall

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.142 align:middle line:84%
we say more the shift that we
can all make in the process?

00:25:52.142 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Well, yeah.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
The shift, of
course, is learning

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:90%
QE, Quantum Entrainment.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And that just
packages it for you.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And it says, OK, now we're
going to do something.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you wait to see
what's going to be done,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happens.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:90%
And then you say, oh, I'm there.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.214 align:middle line:84%
Now do you mean how
I made that shift?

00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I threw
everything out.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So we
can learn from you.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.548 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yeah.

00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I went through
basically 40 years

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of trying and failing,
trying to get hold of it.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And finally, when I said,
well, I'm done trying,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.114 align:middle line:90%
it was peaceful.

00:26:31.114 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, wait a minute.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is it.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Now I've heard that before.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But then it was
always how to not try,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
which is doing something,
and it never works.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So all of the techniques, if
they don't eliminate themselves

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.110 align:middle line:84%
as a technique very
quickly within seconds,

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:90%
then you're into the doing.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So many people will
experience this exalted state,

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.329 align:middle line:84%
but they'll say, oh, I didn't
do it right, or I liked it,

00:26:56.329 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:90%
but how do I do it again?

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.453 align:middle line:90%
How do I make it stronger?

00:26:58.453 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:90%
How do I make it last longer?

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not the point.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.020 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter
whether it's overwhelming you

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're rolling on
the ground in ecstasy

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.080 align:middle line:84%
or you just have this beautiful,
simple little fullness there.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
One is as good as the other.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the mind that gets in
there and says, no, I want more,

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I want more.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:84%
That's also beautiful
in its essence,

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're not
caught up in that.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So the technique doesn't say,
OK, let's stop doing this

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
or let's start doing that.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.034 align:middle line:90%
It just says, pay attention.

00:27:34.034 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
you pay attention.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.177 align:middle line:90%
You perceive.

00:27:37.177 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't get your
intellect involved.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't get your
emotions involved.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
breathe a certain way.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You simply perceive
in a certain way

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:90%
from the level of Eufeeling.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Now that stop
thinking exercise, we

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
could call that pure awareness.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have a prism and you
shine a white light through it,

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
it breaks up into colors,
orange, indigo, violet, yellow,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.800 align:middle line:90%
red, blue, green.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
When you have pure awareness
and it hits the prism,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:90%
the prism is Eufeeling.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Creation takes place.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
is peace, joy, love.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So when we perceive
Eufeeling, we

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
are perceiving the
foundation of creation.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we come from.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:90%
We are first this unbounded--

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Eufeeling is unique
in all of creation.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the only thing that is
unbounded, but undifferentiated

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and has boundaries.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go
to Eufeeling, when

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
we allow our perception
to lay on Eufeeling,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
then we have this
seat, this seat

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.740 align:middle line:84%
where we can watch
creation take place.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when we
have somebody come to us

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and they're in some pain
and we say, OK, we'll do QE,

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:84%
we're not doing
something to that person.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming simply
full of joy, full of love.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what heals.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
The heart is fully open.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.251 align:middle line:84%
Immediately it opens when we
become aware of Eufeeling.

00:29:18.251 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what heals.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing
something to them.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:84%
We're just inviting them
to enjoy what we enjoy.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.530 align:middle line:90%
And they heal all by themselves.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So it seems
both, like self-healing,

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.210 align:middle line:84%
doing it to ourselves, but
it's also teaching practitioner

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
to give that kind
of healing modality.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well, we teach the
participants of the workshops,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
for instance, how to
experience Eufeeling.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:84%
What happens after
that is up to them.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If they want to come
in close proximity--

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if you had a
stiff neck and we were to do QE,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I'd experience Eufeeling.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.666 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't do anything to you.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But because you're there and
because your body already

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
knows how to heal,
it just needs what?

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the universal
healer is rest.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:84%
The principle is the deeper the
rest, the deeper the healing.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this is an
interesting thing.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The deepest rest that we
can experience in activity

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.760 align:middle line:90%
is awareness of Eufeeling.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
In 1970, Dr. Robert
Keith Wallace

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:84%
published a paper that
showed us that awareness

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.470 align:middle line:84%
of pure awareness
elicits a deeper

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
rest than even deep
sleep, certainly

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:90%
dreaming and activity.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So that allows us
then to, in activity,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.130 align:middle line:90%
be very deeply rested.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:90%
That means we're healing.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.626 align:middle line:84%
And when something
comes in, it goes out.

00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Now that doesn't mean
that we don't get sick.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.249 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
we don't get angry.

00:30:46.249 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that life
doesn't have its ups and downs.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of life.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's when you fight that, when
you say, I want to stay up,

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.650 align:middle line:90%
you're on the ocean.

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay on top
of the wave, right?

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.220 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this perception
of Eufeeling

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:84%
allows us to throw out
an anchor to the depths

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.560 align:middle line:84%
so that we can enjoy
it but we're not

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:84%
thrown all over the
ocean by the waves.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.523 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.523 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: It's hard to grasp
when we're listening to it.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I like in my interviews to
really get to the core of it

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.039 align:middle line:84%
so we can really
feel it already.

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when we feel something--
and we can start to feel it.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel it when
you talked about the prism.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's getting
closer to the Eufeeling

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
that you're describing,
but I'm not quite

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:90%
getting all the details.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well, that's because
the more abstract something is,

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.461 align:middle line:84%
the less definite it
is, by definition.

00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.530 align:middle line:84%
This is completely abstract,
so you can't define it.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.209 align:middle line:84%
The mind says-- and
this is the problem.

00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You know
how to explain it.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Well,
I can explain it.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we're doing is
communicating in what?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Boundaries, language.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And something that has
boundaries cannot reflect

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.040 align:middle line:90%
the unbounded.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.960 align:middle line:84%
You see a tree, but is that
the creator of the tree?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the creation, but
it's not the full--

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So the mind says-- and you
have a good sharp mind,

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:84%
one that wants to get in
there and look at everything.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
When you have that, to
experience Eufeeling

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
that just goes away.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a process, as I said.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-step
process, very simple

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and immediately effective.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:84%
But trying to
understand something

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.685 align:middle line:84%
that has no boundaries
is trying to pick up air.

00:32:34.685 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: But
intuitively, you know it.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively, you were
there as a child.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And from time to time, maybe
you're doing a practice,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
you're doing some
meditation, oh my gosh,

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the bliss, the joy, I feel
one with the universe.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, oh, it was the
meditation that did that.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It was your perception.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.807 align:middle line:84%
You finally stopped
trying at one point.

00:32:58.807 --> 00:33:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's when many
meditations start

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
working or become successful
is when you forget them

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.232 align:middle line:84%
and your mind just
goes into this neutral.

00:33:07.232 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Or when
a painter paints.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Or when an interviewer that
loves interviewing interviews,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.912 align:middle line:84%
there's this moment
of pure bliss.

00:33:13.912 --> 00:33:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yeah.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.357 align:middle line:84%
And they're in what
is called the flow.

00:33:19.357 --> 00:33:21.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a book, and
I can't pronounce this

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.944 align:middle line:90%
fellow's-- Csikszentmihalyi.

00:33:23.944 --> 00:33:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I blew that.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But the author wrote
the book "Flow,"

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about
this state inactivity.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what we
call QE awareness,

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and that simply is
becoming aware of Eufeeling

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.100 align:middle line:90%
as we're active.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We're more familiar
with Maslow's work,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.640 align:middle line:90%
his hierarchy of needs.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we fulfill our needs,
at the top of his pyramid

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:90%
is the self-actualization.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And that self-actualization
is the same thing

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:90%
as awareness of Eufeeling.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We human beings are
not done evolving.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And we just struggle,
because we think,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.069 align:middle line:84%
oh, I need to make
things better than it is.

00:34:06.069 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect as it is.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:90%
We just need to realize that.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And the philosophy is
not how we realize it.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not an emotional thing.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:21.320 align:middle line:84%
It is a perceptual thing, that
once you perceive perfection,

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:90%
you're done.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere to
go, nothing to do.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
George Land, who's
a systems scientist,

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:84%
developed the
transformation theory,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.544 align:middle line:90%
theory of transformation.

00:34:33.544 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
every system goes

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:90%
through three phases of growth.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:84%
There's the survival phase,
there's the expansion phase,

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the phase--
he didn't call it this.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:46.600 align:middle line:84%
He called it something else,
but I call it the love of phase.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to know
that I define love

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.239 align:middle line:90%
in a scientific way.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Love is when two
systems come together

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:90%
to create greater harmony.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So two atoms can come
together to create a molecule.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Two people come together
to create a relationship.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Two businesses come
together, or what have you.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Any time two things
come together

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
for greater harmony,
that's love.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Now look at us as a species.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
We started out as
hunter-gatherers.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.430 align:middle line:84%
That was a survival
phase for us.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And all we did, we
had this small group

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that we interacted with
to help us survive.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Then we got it.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We got this idea that, well,
we could cultivate crops.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:90%
We could domesticate animals.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
We had a language, we
developed it, and here we are.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Now we're through this phase.

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, each
phase has its own laws.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can't use the laws
for one phase for another.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:90%
They won't work.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
that we are, as a species,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:84%
in this phase two,
this expansion phase.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's now time
for us to move on

00:35:54.990 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to the love phase, the coming
together for a greater harmony.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're still stuck
in the second phase,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the expansion phase, where we're
in competition, where we're

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.950 align:middle line:84%
driven by more, grow,
grow, grow, grow.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I need more and more.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can only grow
so far, and then you die.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.810 align:middle line:90%
You can't keep growing.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn now how to
interact with the environment.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So what QE does is it allows
us to make the transition that

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is natural for a human being
now to make it for a species

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:90%
or for a relationship.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if we
had a relationship,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
or, let's say, any two
people get together,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
early in their relationship,
they're in a survival mode.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a great
time for a couple,

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's a romantic
relationship, for instance.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.340 align:middle line:84%
They get together,
and they have fun.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And they just love
being with each other,

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and time drags when they're
not together, right?

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.952 align:middle line:84%
And he just loves the way
she's just-- oh, when she eats,

00:36:58.952 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
she makes a little smacking--

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's so cute.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh, he
takes care of himself,

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:90%
and that manly smell.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they get
into the second phase

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.400 align:middle line:84%
where they're growing
and expanding,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:84%
now they cohabitate,
they start a family,

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
they get a house and a
dog, the usual things.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But then there comes a
time in that relationship

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.980 align:middle line:90%
when it kind of gets stale.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Here in the United States,
our lives just separate.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.250 align:middle line:84%
We're working so hard to
realize the American Dream

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:90%
that we lose ourselves.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
At that point, we say,
I want to go back and do

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.769 align:middle line:84%
what we used to do, because
we're falling apart.

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so they go
dancing like they used

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to and all these other
things, but it doesn't work.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Because not-- going
back won't work.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Staying where you
are won't work.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They now have to move
into the real love phase.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Now at this time, this
is when they might say,

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:84%
well-- they either go
outside their relationship

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
for another relationship, or
they just say, this is it.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll just live the
rest of my life

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.510 align:middle line:84%
in this sort of cohabitation
kind of a thing.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And things irritate each other.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.081 align:middle line:84%
Now he says about her, god,
when she eats, I can't stand it.

00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:84%
[MAKES SMACKING SOUND]
all the time.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Ew.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.889 align:middle line:84%
And she says about
him, he's so vain.

00:38:16.889 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
He's always looking at
himself in a mirror.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.096 align:middle line:84%
And I wish he would just take
a shower every now and then,

00:38:21.096 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:90%
that smell.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.310 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
he says about her,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%
oh, god I could just eat her up.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:84%
In the second phase
when they're bumping up

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
against-- he says to himself,
god, I wish I had eaten her up.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bruce Lipton, too,
that you probably know,

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:41.054 align:middle line:84%
wrote about this
honeymoon effect.

00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's phase one
moving to phase two.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we move there
pretty naturally,

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.440 align:middle line:84%
although we have
a lot of failure.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
You might date many people
before you settle down

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.140 align:middle line:90%
with a partner.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's the phase three
that we're focusing on.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And phase one to
phase two, transition

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
is very simple, very easy,
and it's done seamlessly.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But phase two to phase three
takes quite a bit more,

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and we won't go into it here.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:84%
But it requires that you come
together on the level of unity.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to become fully human.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to express
what you are.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know what
that is, you're doomed.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So you must know what
your foundation is,

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
what the basis is, and
then work from there.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.954 align:middle line:84%
And the other
person must too, so

00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:84%
that you have two
people coming together

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.250 align:middle line:84%
from the level of
Eufeeling or, as Maslow

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:84%
would say, from
self-actualized functioning.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
He calls those
people transcenders.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're out there.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.950 align:middle line:84%
He says there's 0.5% to
2% of the population-- 2%

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:84%
is pretty conservative--
that naturally are living

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:57.660 align:middle line:84%
this aware of Eufeeling or in
QE awareness that we call it.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But my effort here is to
wake people up to the idea

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that there's nowhere to
go and nothing to do.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You just settle down,
stop, pay attention.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Now you can come out and do.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And your life is
fine just like it is.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.696 align:middle line:84%
The things that need to
change will, automatically.

00:40:16.696 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And the things
that don't, you'll

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:84%
appreciate them
for what they are.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have now is you
falling in love with yourself.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The outer self
and the inner self

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:84%
come together for
greater harmony.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And now you as a
whole human being

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.949 align:middle line:84%
can interact with others
on the same level.

00:40:35.949 --> 00:40:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you come together,
and you're not competing.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying to steal.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.680 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying to manipulate.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
conversation with someone

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:84%
else who's self-actualized, what
happens is two people-- here,

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:84%
most communication, two
people come together in,

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
let's say, phase two or in this
common consciousness 98% of us

00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:90%
are in.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.491 align:middle line:84%
They come together
and they're always

00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:03.150 align:middle line:90%
looking to take something.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd like a
compliment, or I

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:84%
want to tell them about my
weekend so that they'll know

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and they'll feel better,
so on and so forth.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So if two people come together
with the idea of taking,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.106 align:middle line:90%
they walk away unfulfilled.

00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:19.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And we see this
in the workshops.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you learn
QE, the atmosphere,

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:90%
the environment shifts.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It becomes softer.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.599 align:middle line:90%
It becomes more alive.

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:90%
It becomes more like you.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening
is you experience Eufeeling

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and you start recognizing
it, perceiving it

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in the objects around you.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what actually
happens is you

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.750 align:middle line:84%
start falling in love
with your environment.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.929 align:middle line:84%
You start moving into
phase three functioning.

00:41:46.929 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And then we're not in
front of people that have all

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:84%
those expectations and
those strings attached.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Most of us no longer want this.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.105 align:middle line:84%
It feels so good to be part of
something that is unconditional

00:42:01.105 --> 00:42:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and that we're really just there
showing up because we want to.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yes.

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's unconditional.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:84%
That's unbounded
within the boundaries.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
you can have it.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So we keep thinking-- and here's
the problem-- that where we are

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is not good enough.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.514 align:middle line:84%
So if I just do
this, I'll be there.

00:42:19.514 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm there,
I'll be happy.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I mentioned that earlier.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But what's actually happening
is we're creating a goal,

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.085 align:middle line:90%
and a goal means two.

00:42:27.085 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It means where you are and where
you want to be, in your mind.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So now as soon as you
have two, we already

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.750 align:middle line:90%
know that you can't have one.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So where you are
is where you are.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:90%
You have to admit that.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Is there any better place to be?

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, the mind may say yes,
but you are where you are.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.150 align:middle line:84%
You might as well
enjoy the fullness

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.850 align:middle line:84%
of where you are, not from an
intellectual or emotional point

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.970 align:middle line:90%
of view but simply a perception.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, it's
so simple and so easy.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm just amazed at this.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like I had some
great training or anything.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:08.140 align:middle line:90%
I just sort of stumbled on this.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And when it happened
to me, I said,

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if I can teach this.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I taught
it, and it worked.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I wonder
if I can write it down.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.347 align:middle line:84%
I wrote it down, people
read it, and it worked.

00:43:22.347 --> 00:43:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I said, great.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.090 align:middle line:90%
We can put it in books.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not limited to
me just teaching it.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Then it got translated
first into German,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and now it's around the world.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.389 align:middle line:84%
And we've only been doing
this, I think, five years now.

00:43:34.389 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You call it
"The Kinslow System."

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.245 align:middle line:90%
That's your last book.

00:43:37.245 --> 00:43:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: "The
Kinslow System."

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.474 align:middle line:90%
That's my last name, Kinslow.

00:43:40.474 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The Kinslow System involves
the Quantum Entrainment,

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
but there are a number
of techniques in there--

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and I've just perceived a more
refined level of Eufeeling

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
called Pure Eufeeling--
and then how to apply that,

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:90%
for instance, if you get angry.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're angry and you're
being swept along by this anger,

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Count to 10 or say,
I shouldn't be angry?

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
None of that works.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I've developed a technique
to take that anger away,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to allow it to dissipate very,
very quickly, very quickly

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and allow us to reestablish
awareness of Eufeeling.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:24.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's done not by
getting rid of anger.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not the goal.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.069 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as you have a
goal of getting rid of anger,

00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:90%
you now have a goal, don't you?

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360 align:middle line:90%
And you have two things.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Where I am is angry, and where
I want to be is not right?

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So what this does,
it's the coin reality.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of us say that positive
is what we want and negative

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:90%
is what we don't want.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
conducive to inner peace.

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a coin,
let's say a gold coin,

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's clean,
flat, and you stamp

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:84%
on one side a P for positive
and on the other side an N

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.170 align:middle line:90%
for negative.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you know, well, OK, that's
positive, that's negative.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:90%
So I don't want the negative.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I want the positive.

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:07.820 align:middle line:90%
This is what the mind says.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:90%
So now we have a goal, right?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful thing is
that positive and negative

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:17.980 align:middle line:84%
are imprints of the
gold in the coin.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So my question is, if there's
a positive and a negative,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.700 align:middle line:90%
what are they?

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:90%
What is positive and negative?

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.270 align:middle line:90%
What is the essence of them?

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the coin made of?

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:90%
You have two sides of a coin.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.650 align:middle line:90%
What is the coin?

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And the mind says,
oh, I have no idea.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Where do I start?

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:90%
How do I know what the coin is?

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The answer is the coin is
indefinable but perceivable

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.400 align:middle line:90%
through Eufeeling.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So Eufeeling is the coin,
and from Eufeeling comes

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.690 align:middle line:84%
everything negative
and positive.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
When you perceive that, when
you say life is the coin

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and it has negative
and positive,

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:84%
when your perception is on
the coin not one or the other,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.970 align:middle line:90%
now the whole coin has value.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not, I just want heads.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:90%
I just want P. You see?

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:84%
That is the new technique or, I
should say, the new expression

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of this technique that
I'm writing about now

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be teaching very soon.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.415 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And how are
you going to call that?

00:46:19.415 --> 00:46:20.816 align:middle line:90%
That's the pure Eufeeling, no?

00:46:20.816 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: No.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a realization
of pure Eufeeling.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:24.545 align:middle line:84%
The way I do that,
there's a book

00:46:24.545 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:84%
called "Eufeeling" that I
wrote that introduces you

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:28.990 align:middle line:90%
to pure Eufeeling.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Now it's how to perceive
it in everyday life,

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to see the unity, so
not just to perceive

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.210 align:middle line:84%
it inside but now
perceive it in everything.

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So as I look at you and I see
the palm trees and the sky,

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:46.240 align:middle line:84%
all of that is one thing,
and I'm perceiving that now.

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.442 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm going to teach.

00:46:48.442 --> 00:46:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Well, thank
you so much, Frank,

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:90%
for this delicious interview.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> KINSLOW: Oh, this
has been so much fun.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And the climate and
the weather couldn't be any

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:56.650 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:57.441 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: No, no.

00:46:57.441 --> 00:46:59.102 align:middle line:84%
I really love the
excuse of being here.

00:46:59.102 --> 00:47:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I live on the
other side of the state

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:90%
where it's nice and quiet.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Sarasota, huh?

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right on the bay.

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm familiar
with this, but this

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.667 align:middle line:84%
is a nice change of pace,
these crazy Miamians.

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Beautiful.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And my delicious co-creators,
if you've watched this video

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and enjoyed it, please
share it and put

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the comments underneath
the video, and then let's

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.510 align:middle line:90%
get the conversation rolling.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.362 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:47:22.362 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> KINSLOW: Absolutely.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Big, big
kisses to all of you.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:37.767 align:middle line:90%
