-Hello.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.690 align:middle line:90%
This is Lilou for Gaiam TV.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.701 align:middle line:10%
Today I'm in Glasgow,
Scotland with Anita Moorjani.

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.410 align:middle line:10%
Hello.
-Hello, Lilou.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.890 align:middle line:10%
It's so nice to
be here with you.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:90%
I love Anita's story.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:84%
You probably have
seen her on the web.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed her
many times and this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
is the first time that we're
meeting in person-- so good.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:90%
It's really exciting.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to see you.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
You had a near-death
experience,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
an NDE, a major one, one
of the most relevant ones

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:84%
that exists right now
in your reporting.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So many beautiful
things, so many

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
lessons that we're going to
talk about in this interview.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about 40-48
minute interview

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
here, because you're one of
the speakers of the I Can Do It

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
conference, organized
by Hay House.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to share
the stage with Dr.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer that introduced
us when I was back in Maui.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that was a
long time ago, back

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
before my book even came out.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I'm really excited I'm
going to be on stage tomorrow

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
really exciting.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And your story-- near-death
experiences in general right

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
now, this is a big topic.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
speak about it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and I feel very-- I feel it's
an important topic to share,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot
of beautiful lessons

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
about our relationship with
time, is there life after life,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
as Dr. Raymond Moody talked
about in his book back in 1975.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
You went through this experience
after a cancer, a huge cancer.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It was a lymphoma grade 4B?
-That's right.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It was lymphoma grade 4B.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had cancer for
four years until my body

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:90%
completely broke down.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time I had
the cancer four years,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:90%
my body deteriorated.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And so my muscles were
all completely wasted

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and I had tumors
all over my body,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
like all over my
neck and my underarms

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and chest and abdomen.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
covered with tumors.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had fluid in my
lungs, open skin lesions.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was breathing
with the aid of oxygen.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And then my organs shut down.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
went into a coma.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that time that I
had the near death experience,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
because the doctors
told my family

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that these were my final
hours and that I was dying.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
That was in 2002 you were
diagnosed, and then in 2006

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.160 align:middle line:84%
that's when you went
into the coma state.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's exactly right.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was diagnosed
in April, 2002.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was February the second,
2006 that I went into a coma.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And even though I
was in a coma though,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of everything
that was happening around me.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It was as though I was more
awake or alert than normal.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Did it go in and out, in and
out before you completely went

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
into this experience?

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.665 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, interestingly it was.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It started out as though--
I felt as though I was--

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
drifting in and out

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, because
I was aware of what

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:90%
was happening on this side.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I was aware of
things on the other side.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Like I encountered my
father, who had passed away

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:90%
about 10 years before that.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I encountered my
best friend who had

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:90%
passed away two years before.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I was aware
of everything that

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:90%
was happening in this side.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it felt
like I was drifting

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
in and out, in and out.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But much later, after I came
out of the coma completely,

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I found out from doctors and
family that I was in the coma

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
I was like not here
the whole time.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Your heart was
actually stopped or not?

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.240 align:middle line:90%
No, my heart was still beating.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But my breathing was
aided with the machine.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was breathing with the
aid of the oxygen machine.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And my heart was still beating
and there were the machines

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and Danny was watching the
machine the whole night just--

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Danny, your husband?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Danny my husband--
just to make sure

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't stop breathing.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And basically, my family
were waiting, thinking

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:90%
that these were my last hours.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
The skeptic, of
course-- there's

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that are skeptic
about near-death experience.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They speak out, the
drugs could induce

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:90%
those kind of experience.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you think it was your case?

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that there
will always be skeptics.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction is
that I'm actually

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
not trying to convince
anyone of anything,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:90%
because I have nothing.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to sell
anything or convince anyone.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm only sharing
what happened to me.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
I have proof for

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that my cancer,
the healing from my cancer

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:90%
was dramatic.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's no way to prove
that what I experienced

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
in the other realm
was real or whether it

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
was the drugs or anything.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to prove that.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows that
I was in the hospital,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:90%
that I was unconscious.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The medical records show
that I was unconscious.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows I was
supposed to die that night.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what the records show.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And the records show
that I came out of it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
and I healed very quickly.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
conversation that happened.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You even saw your brother
flying in to come and see you.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
You felt what they
felt. You heard them.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
You felt them.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about this omnipresent
type of experience.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Oh it was like-- it
was an incredible,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:90%
incredible experience.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like my consciousness--
it was like I was no

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
longer restrained by my body.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I just
expanded beyond my body

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and I was feeling really light
and free and no longer in pain,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
no longer encumbered
by the cancer.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
It was just such an
amazing, amazing feeling.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I just expanded
and I felt like I was loved.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I use the word "loved," but it's
not exactly what describes it.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like I was
unconditionally loved,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
like I didn't have
to prove myself

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:90%
or work hard at being loved.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
work at being worthy.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I was just loved, just
because I existed.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was just the
most amazing feeling.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Even though if you were
feeling the fear and the pain

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of other people around
and even the doctors,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you could hear a conversation
in a different room.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So you would hear
what was happening,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:90%
but you felt nothing but love.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I felt nothing but
love for myself, and for them.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I was able to hear
the conversations

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
and every single
thing the doctors did.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of every procedure,
of them poking needles

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
into my veins and removing
fluid from my lungs,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:84%
because my lungs were
filled with fluid

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.150 align:middle line:90%
and I was choking on my fluid.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors were putting
a needle in through my back

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and removing the fluid.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of everything
they were doing,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
conversations they were having,
even conversations that took

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
place outside the room, which
I was able to relate to them

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
after, which really
shocked them.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The doctor was really
shocked when I came out

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
of the coma, when I actually
told him that you had come

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
into my room at about 4:00
or 5:00 AM in the morning

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
and you took fluid
out of my lungs.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And he was really surprised.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, but you
were unconscious.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:90%
How would you know that?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I felt everything.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I saw it all.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I felt everything
they were feeling.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like as though we
share one consciousness.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So I could feel what
my family was feeling.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I could feel what every
doctor and nurse was feeling.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But even though I could feel
what they were feeling--

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I could feel their
fear or their anxiety,

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:84%
I could feel my
family's sadness.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
All I felt for
them, all of them,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
was just unconditional
love and empathy.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I could just feel-- I was
just emphasizing with them.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if people around
you felt a similar experience?

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Because more and more now,
we talk about shared NDEs.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes people
in the room could feel

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:90%
that something is happening.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Did they have any idea what
you were going through,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
or you had to report
it once you came back?

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The people around me,
they didn't have any idea

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
what I was going through.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is,
my brother, who was in India,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:84%
even before my mother
called him to say

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that I had gone into a coma
and he should come here,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:90%
he felt something.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So even before my mother
or husband called them,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
he just felt something
was wrong that morning

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:90%
when I went into a coma.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately went to
get on a flight to Hong Kong.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't get a flight
in the town that he was in.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
He drove four hours out of
his town to the next town

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
to get on a flight to come
to Hong Kong to see me.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was while he was in
the car going to that airport

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that he got the phone
call from a family member

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:84%
to tell him to
hurry up and come.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, I'm
already on my way.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I sensed something was wrong.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So during my
near-death experience,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.410 align:middle line:84%
I was connecting
with my brother.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:90%
And he felt it.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
He actually felt something
to rush and come to see me.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was a part of me that
was already connecting with him

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and not wanting to die until he
came, because I didn't want him

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to come and feel really sad
or guilty that it was too

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:90%
late, that I'd already gone.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to wait
until he got here.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was like he sensed that.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.905 align:middle line:84%
So you were thinking that, or
you wanted him to think that,

00:10:34.905 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or how did you actually
communicate it from that way,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%
from your state to his?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember
I was thinking it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I wasn't thinking it
with the intention of sending

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:90%
it to him, but he got it.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking it
for myself, to myself.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, I
mustn't die yet.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I must wait until my
brother gets here,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
because he will feel
terrible if he gets here

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:90%
and I'm already gone.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I clearly remember thinking
that, that I must wait.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
And something compelled him.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And my thinking that caused
him to head out earlier.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And you were told that
you needed to come back,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%
or you had the choice.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Was it a choice,
or was it, no, you

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
go back because you
have something to do

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and you will be healed?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
I had the choice of
whether to come back or not.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But my first instinct
was not to come back,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
because my body was so sick.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I don't want to
come back to this sick body.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my family's
suffering because I'm sick.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I would continue to suffer.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:90%
There was just no point.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But then I understood why I got
the cancer in the first place.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And also because I
met my father, who

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:90%
had passed away 10 years ago.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And I met my best friend, who
had passed away two years ago.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:84%
They also-- well,
actually, my father

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
impressed upon me that even
though you have a choice,

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:90%
it's not your time.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:90%
You can still go back.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%
But that place was so amazing.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It was so hard to
leave that realm.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But then I started
to understand why

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I got the cancer, why
everything that had happened,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:90%
happened to me.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
I had this incredible-- like
it was a clarity, that I knew

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly what it was that had
led me to that point in time

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I knew why everything, all the
decisions I had made in my life

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:84%
up to that point had brought
me to that moment in time.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I
could see it all.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.080 align:middle line:90%
I understood it.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And from that understanding,
I knew that if I went back,

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that now that I understood
what caused my cancer,

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I would no longer
have the cancer.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And I understood
that we as humans,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that I was an amazing human
being, that we all are.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.370 align:middle line:84%
We are all amazing
spiritual beings.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
But I had never allowed my
magnificence to flow through.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
I had always suppressed
it out of fear.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that all I
had to do was to come back

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and to allow myself to be
the magnificence that I am.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And that was all I had to
do and my body would heal.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Just showing up.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Just showing up-- and
that's all we all have to do,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is to just show up and just be
true to who we, be authentic.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And it feels much
better, doesn't it?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like out of prison.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.
It is.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:90%
More than one way for you.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it really is.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:90%
It's like being out of prison.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:90%
It so is.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was after I had got
that understanding while still

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:84%
in the other realm, that was
when my father and my best

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
friend, it was like
they confirmed,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:84%
they impressed upon
me, now that you know

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:84%
the truth of who you
really are, go back

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:90%
and live your life fearlessly.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Your dad, you had a good
relationship with your dad

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
while growing up?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
raised in Hong Kong?

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was raised
in Hong Kong.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
My parents are Hindu,
Indian by race.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And my father and I had
a turbulent relationship,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
because he had very
traditional Hindu values.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
British school where I

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:90%
adopted very different values.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So my father and
I, we constantly

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
clashed, because he wanted me
to have an arranged marriage.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me
to be more homely.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want that at all.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to work.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to travel.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want an
arranged marriage.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So we used to
clash all the time.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And we had very different ideas.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
is, when I was in that realm,

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in that near-death realm,
and when I encountered him,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
because we were both without
our culture, without our bodies,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
without our race--
there was nothing

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
physical, nothing
biological about us

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.430 align:middle line:90%
at all, no ego no culture.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
We were just pure spirit,
pure consciousness.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And all I could
feel from him was

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
unconditional
love-- nothing else,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.540 align:middle line:90%
just pure unconditional love.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that actually,
that's all he ever had

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:90%
for me was unconditional love.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we express ourselves
through our physical bodies,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
our biology, our culture,
our beliefs, our values,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
it kind of filters that love.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And so my father had
loved me in the best way

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
he knew how through
his cultural filters.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that he
didn't love me unconditionally.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
He was just showing it in
the only way he knew how.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I completely understood
it from that realm.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you understood it very
quickly, because it's not

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.900 align:middle line:90%
like-- how long was the coma?

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The coma was only
about 30 hours.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my goodness,
30 hours, only.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Ooh la la, that's a long one.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But I understood a lot
of things in that time,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
because it's not linear
time in that realm.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like again, when
we're without our biology,

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't feel like
time runs linear.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like everything's
happening simultaneously.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So everything with
my father, it's

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
not like we're
having a conversation

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:90%
like we're doing now.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm stringing the words
together to form a sentence

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're processing
in linear time.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Over there, it's immediate.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I just knew what
my father wanted

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%
me to know-- instantaneous.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just impressed upon you.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
And you've never forgotten.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:84%
How can you forget
such a moment?

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:90%
You can't forget.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
It becomes you.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's everything-- everything
that happened with my father,

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:84%
with my friend, with myself,
with my own realization,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:84%
my understanding of my own
disease, the cancer, how I got

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:90%
it-- it just becomes imprinted.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And it changes who you
are, in an instant.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not like going
to school and learning

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or going through courses
or even self-help courses

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:90%
or reading books.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like, instant.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine, not even
like listening to an audio CD

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:90%
or reading a book.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.645 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if you
put an audio CD--

00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
or imagine if you just
held it and you absorbed

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.680 align:middle line:90%
all the information in it.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It's that quick.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.069 align:middle line:84%
It's like that.
-Boom.

00:17:53.069 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, boom.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's this knowing
because you woke up

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and you felt-- you probably
were aching a little bit.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But then rapidly, your
body healed and you knew.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And now you feel invincible.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly right.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up, at first I
was feeling a little bit--

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
my body was physically aching
and it was still very weak

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and I still had the
open skin lesions.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So my physical body needed
a little time to recover.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But inside, I was euphoric,
because I knew I was healed.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I am
actually healed,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.922 align:middle line:84%
but my body just
needs to catch up.

00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even a
hope or a belief

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
or I'm putting it out there.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I just knew.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%
I knew that, oh, I'm invincible.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm already healed.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.440 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm back.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm awake.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And where do you
think this feeling

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
of being invisible comes from?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:90%
It comes from an inner knowing.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we get in
touch with our consciousness,

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:06.320 align:middle line:84%
with our truth, with our heart,
what's in there, and if we get

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that and
what we get from there,

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:90%
that comes from inner knowing.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:84%
When we get our
information from outside,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.820 align:middle line:84%
then that's when we can
lose ourselves and like,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:90%
should I do this?

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Should I do that?

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Or is this going to happen
or is that going to happen?

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't know.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all very shaky.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:90%
We never feel invincible.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.681 align:middle line:84%
When it comes from
here, it's invincible.

00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It's truth.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like, when you know
it here, it will happen.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It will definitely happen.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is, you know here.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you think you invoked that?

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we
can bring that in?

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is it we need some
kind of powerful event

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to really feel it on such a
DNA level and molecule level?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I know all your
atoms, everything

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
is vibrating that now.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that it's something
that we can do without having

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:90%
to go through an NDE.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually my
intention of sharing my story.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
My only intention is
so that other people

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
don't have to go through such
a dramatic thing like I did.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't want other people
to have to go that far

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.175 align:middle line:84%
and to nearly die
or to have an NDE.

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:21.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
This is my intention
of sharing my story,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:84%
hoping that at some level, you
can start to-- actually start

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to stop giving your power
away to external elements,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
external things that brainwash
us-- things like fears

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of inadequacy
and so on, and start

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
taking your power back
and listening to yourself,

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.050 align:middle line:90%
silencing your mind.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
When you silence your
mind, it means silencing

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%
the input that's coming in.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we are being
bombarded with information.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So it means silencing
that for awhile so

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you can get in touch
with this and start

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
living from this place
of who you really are.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And it means living more
from the place of joy,

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because who you are
in here is somebody

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
who is desperate to feel
joyful and to let it out,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:90%
a magnificent being.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And once you can get
in touch with that--

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and it means doing what makes
you feel good about yourself,

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:90%
it means loving yourself.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It means allowing
yourself to be yourself.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It means stop forsaking
yourself for other people,

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
being a doormat
for other people,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
worrying about not
being good enough,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:84%
worrying about
pleasing other people.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.090 align:middle line:90%
It means stopping all that.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start
to feel invincible.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It feels like nearly
scary to just know that,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
because of like, who am I,
then the question comes.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a big question
that people ask is,

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, under all that, who am I?

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
The clue is to look for
what makes you really happy,

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
what makes your heart sing.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you just even ask
yourself this question,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
because I always say,
it's really important

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
to love yourself.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And people say, how do I
even start to love yourself?

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:90%
So ask yourself this question.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
If I loved myself, what
would I do right now?

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
When I wake up in the morning,
what would I spend my time

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
doing if I was someone
that really, really

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
loved, valued, treasured,
and respected myself,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.280 align:middle line:90%
what would I be doing?

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
question to answer.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's your clue as
to who you really are.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And then allowing within that,
because a lot of people as you

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
saying, are searching
for their purpose,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
would love to contribute,
would love to be on target

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:90%
and have things flowing.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But within that,
it's also allowing.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely is allowing.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Because again, if we feel
the need to go pursuing,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
chasing aggressively going after
what we want, again, what we're

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:84%
doing is we're even sending
ourselves the message

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
good enough and we

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
need to work really hard to
compete with everyone else

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and to aggressively
pursue what we want.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, you deserve
and you are worthy

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and you deserve to have
everything that is yours.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So all you have to
do is if you love

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
yourself, what is
yours-- you will

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:90%
actually attract what is yours.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So you know how
many of us believe

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts attract
our reality or are

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:90%
thoughts create our reality?

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
I would go one step
further and to say,

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
it's our thoughts
about ourselves

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:90%
that create our reality.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:84%
The more you love
yourself, the more

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:90%
other people will love you.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The more you hate yourself for
disrespect yourself or treat

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
yourself badly, the more
other people will also

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.790 align:middle line:90%
not respect you or trod on you.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's your thoughts
about yourself

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:90%
that's really important.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about this lady
that you had on the radio

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and you spoke of unconditional
love and relationship.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into this,
because I feel

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
it's really aligned with
where we're at right now

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:90%
in this conversation.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Sure, I'd love to.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this started
out as a message

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
for a specific person
who was having a problem

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:90%
in their relationship.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to do was I
wanted to share the difference

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
between the kind of love that
normally we as physical humans

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
have in a relationship,
versus unconditional love.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Normally in a
human relationship,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.670 align:middle line:84%
we expect a lot
of loyalty and we

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
sign contracts such as legal,
marital contracts and so on.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of like
there's an expectation.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
This is what I call
the conditional love.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And I will stay with you out
of loyalty, out of obligation,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and so on, even
when we get older.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, true unconditional
love is-- oh,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and also the other thing
is, very often when we meet

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:84%
somebody that we
want to marry or we

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
want to spend the rest
of our lives with,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.440 align:middle line:84%
it's because that person
makes us feel good.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And when a person leaves
us and we want them back,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:90%
it's because we feel good.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It makes us feel good
to have them back.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
When you truly love
somebody unconditionally,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
you want for them
what they want.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.530 align:middle line:84%
When you don't love
someone unconditionally,

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and when you only
want-- when you only

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
love someone because
it's what you want,

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:90%
you think you love them.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But actually, you are not
loving them unconditionally.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So true unconditional
love is when

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you want for the other person
what they want for themselves.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody wants
to leave a relationship

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but you still want them
in the relationship,

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's a problem, what
I would like to see people do

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is to actually have a
dialogue where you can say

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to the other person, where
you can say to your partner

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:90%
that I love you unconditionally.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to have for
yourself what you want.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, if what
you want is something that

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:84%
doesn't resonate with
me-- in other words,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.420 align:middle line:84%
you cannot have another
partner and still

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:90%
expect me to hang around.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I love myself enough that if
I can't accept what you want,

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I love myself enough to
leave the relationship,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to not hang around
and be mistreated.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And you think we should
have those conversations

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:90%
in relationships?

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that if it's a
problematical relationship,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
if there is some problems, I
think that if two people really

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:84%
want to get honest and
real with each other,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:25.320 align:middle line:84%
they need to be brave enough to
actually say to their partner

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that I want to know what you
want in the relationship.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Because currently,
what we're doing

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and why very often we have
problematic relationships

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
is because at the
moment, it's about what

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I want in the relationship
and I'm not getting it met.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, I'm not happy.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to ask
each other and to listen

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:50.840 align:middle line:84%
is, I want to know what you
want in the relationship.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I love you enough for
you to actually achieve it.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:90%
But it has to be mutual.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the partner has to say
that to you-- what do you want,

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and I love you
enough to make sure

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:90%
that you get what you want.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
if two people really

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.650 align:middle line:84%
love each other unconditionally
in a relationship,

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:84%
my part in your relationship is
to allow you to be you so you

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.670 align:middle line:90%
can achieve what you want.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Your part is to allow me
to be me with no judgment,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:90%
so I can achieve what I want.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.807 align:middle line:84%
And that's true
unconditional love.

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It feels like it
takes a lot to have

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:90%
two people on that same level.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but I feel that's the
relationship of the future.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Because today, so
many relationships

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:90%
are crumbling, so many.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Or not even meant
to be, I feel.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, not even meant to be.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
relationship of the future

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:84%
truly will be based
on this level of love,

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
where I want to be
with you because I

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:90%
love you for who you are.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And my being with
you will always

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:90%
allow you to be who you are.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of valid for
everything in our life, at work

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.300 align:middle line:84%
but also with our health and
the kind of food that we eat.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many things
that we're expecting

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.370 align:middle line:84%
or we want in life, but
then we're not really

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
stepping in fully
and daring to have

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.410 align:middle line:84%
those authentic conversations
and daring to speak our truth.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Or we're waiting for
others to do their part

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and to be the leaders
and transform this world.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But really, your message
in its essence is, wake up.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.280 align:middle line:90%
This your time.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to shine
and live fully and love.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It's daring to actually
take charge of your life.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I think many of us are
very ready to blame people.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We blame our parents
for how we turned out.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We blame our relationships,
our partners, our spouses.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I mean, is that
if your partner does not allow

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
you to be who you
are, you need to love

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
yourself enough also to not
be treated like a doormat.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's really daring
to take charge.

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Stop blaming.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Even stop blaming all
the big corporates,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.390 align:middle line:84%
because we support those big
corporates by buying into them.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Stop blaming them and
stop buying into it.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I say.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:27.490 align:middle line:84%
The big message is that when
you love yourself enough,

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
you will not control
other people.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
But you will also not allow
other people to control you.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:90%
So dare to be yourself.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:90%
This is a big lesson.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
living this truth

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and you must be
thrilled to see how

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:84%
your life is unfolding
in a much bigger way

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.430 align:middle line:90%
than you could even expect.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
You knew coming back that
something will happen

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and something will
be taking care

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of, but you had no idea this
would be such a dream, fully

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
stepping in the
dream, fully stepping

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:90%
on the heaven on earth, huh?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Gosh, no.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this has
become-- I could not have

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.350 align:middle line:90%
scripted something like this.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.400 align:middle line:84%
This has just become so
much bigger than anything

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I could ever have imagined
or dreamed of, ever.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.035 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.035 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I know you're sharing the
stage here with Wayne Dyer.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But your book is selling
like little pancakes.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is just for you,
but for you the main thing

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.540 align:middle line:84%
is just being yourself,
sharing wherever it goes, even

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:84%
if-- I'm sure we'll
see you very soon

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.170 align:middle line:90%
on the "Oprah Winfrey Show."

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different
things that when the ego is not

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:90%
attached can unfold naturally.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, I think
that people who identify too

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:01.350 align:middle line:84%
strongly with the ego, I think
that it just comes from a place

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%
of fear, and that's all.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And once we help people release
their fear, it's totally fine.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Because once you trust, then you
don't have to chase anything.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And right now--
and life is so much

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.340 align:middle line:90%
more fun when you just allow.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really
just allowing.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:90%
It's much more relaxing.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel as
tired or as drained

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
because you just have
to show up and just

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:90%
be yourself, be authentic.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
authentic, you will always

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.640 align:middle line:90%
attract whatever's truly yours.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The real gifts will come to
you when you allow yourself

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and when you dare
to be authentic.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Most of us think out of fear.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We think we have to cover
up who we are and try

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and be someone else and
try and be better or try

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and be like somebody else.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But that just means,
again, that we're

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.820 align:middle line:84%
sending ourselves the
message that we're

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
not good enough as we are.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But once you are
authentic and yourself,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:84%
life actually
becomes much easier.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, for me,
it's so not about selling

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
books or anything.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't care if nobody
bought a single book,

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
because I was sharing my
message on the internet

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:90%
even before that.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
with the flow,

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:90%
just seeing where it takes me.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there even--
because a lot of people

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:90%
spoke of different practices.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Of course, lot of us
seen the secret at

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
with the law of attraction.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And this has evolved
since the secret.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I think we have brought
different pieces

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:84%
about the feeling
and the allowing.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But from what I'm hearing, it's
not anymore about the vision

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:90%
board or dreaming big.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Or do you actually
pray or declare or see

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:84%
things or have images, or you're
just really in the allowing?

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's interesting.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I hate to
admit it, but I'm not

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
big into visioning or
goal setting or creating

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:90%
or into prayer or intent.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't set my intentions.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:90%
I actually don't do any of that.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'm
afraid to admit that,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.469 align:middle line:84%
but I actually
don't do any of it.

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I just live in the moment.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I have dreams, but
to me dreams are

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.159 align:middle line:84%
different from what we call
goal setting or intention

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:90%
setting or anything.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Because dreams come
from the heart.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And dreams are something--
they just come.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you
can be daydreaming.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:90%
You can be still in your mind.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:84%
And then you will feel
these amazing dreams

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.120 align:middle line:84%
just coming that just
pull at the heart strings.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh my God.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.409 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be amazing
to be like that?

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
But I don't set any kind of
timeline or goal or anything.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe
that the past--

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing as
the past because it's gone.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.750 align:middle line:90%
The future hasn't come yet.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:84%
My only obligation is to make
the best of the present moment.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:02.210 align:middle line:84%
If I can find joy-- my only
obligation really is to find

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.310 align:middle line:90%
joy in the present moment.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry about the
vision coming true or the goal.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
worry about a thing.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can be
happy in this moment

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and just find something
to be really happy about

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:84%
and laugh and have
joy in this moment,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:84%
if my only focus is this
moment, then my future

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.710 align:middle line:90%
is automatically taken care of.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Because what is your future but
a collection of present moments

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
going forward?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So our only
obligation is to find

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.940 align:middle line:84%
joy in this present
moment, and nothing more.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And your future
is taken care of.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:84%
There is a bad news,
a challenging news,

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:84%
how do you react now or how
would you like to react?

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I would have to take it in.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And life is what it is, and
we do deal with challenges.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And I will allow
myself to feel whatever

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel, whether it's sadness,
whether I need to grieve.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I will grieve.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.841 align:middle line:84%
I will allow myself to
feel everything and not

00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:90%
judge myself.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Holding back from
whatever emotion is there.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't hold back
from many emotion.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I tend not to feel things
like guilt and regret.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if we live life to
the fullest in every moment,

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.190 align:middle line:90%
we have nothing to regret.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm feeling sad,
I allow it to pass.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel that when
we feel that our thoughts

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
create our reality,
we tend to suppress

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.350 align:middle line:90%
the thoughts we don't like.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't suppress anything.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.160 align:middle line:90%
If I feel sad, I will feel sad.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I may not go out and
meet people and show

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:47.190 align:middle line:84%
them I'm feeling lousy, but I
will allow myself to feel it.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.611 align:middle line:84%
And when you allow your
feelings, they pass.

00:36:50.611 --> 00:36:52.170 align:middle line:84%
-Really fast.
-Yeah, they do.

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And the sun comes out again.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you suppress them and
you try and convince yourself

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.680 align:middle line:84%
you're not having
those feelings,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.140 align:middle line:84%
they linger for a long time,
because they're pushing back.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're pushing them down
and they're pushing back.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So you get into this
kind of entanglement,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.030 align:middle line:90%
this battle with your feelings.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't battle them.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't judge them.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I just allow them.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just a part of life.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a facet of who I
am, and it will pass.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Those are great, great lessons
there that you're giving us.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And it feels right.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It feels so right to say that,
even regarding the practices.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just saying
it to myself.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.610 align:middle line:84%
The more throughout my journey
as I started opening my heart

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the love, this
is what's the most important

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.070 align:middle line:90%
in the end.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.610 align:middle line:84%
The meditation, all of
that-- we do that when we're

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment anyway.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And we enjoy what we do.
-Yes.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Every time when you're actually
feeling joyful, when you're

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
in that feeling,
that feeling place,

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you're actually creating
the future already.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:84%
That is the feeling
that keeps you-- that

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is your only obligation is
to find that feeling that

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.940 align:middle line:90%
brings you joy.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you just do that, just
make the best of every moment.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Live your life to the fullest,
even if it means drinking

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:90%
champagne and eating chocolate.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing I want people
to know is that a lot of people

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:84%
think that certain things
more spiritual than others.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.270 align:middle line:90%
You are a spiritual being.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.020 align:middle line:90%
You cannot not be.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.990 align:middle line:90%
We just are we.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to work
hard at being spiritual.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
I used to fear.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I used to think I had to
work hard at being spiritual.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%
I now realize I don't.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:90%
We are spiritual beings.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Being yourself and
being spiritual

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:37.510 align:middle line:90%
is one and the same thing.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Lilou, who travels around the
world interviewing people,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.500 align:middle line:84%
you are a beautiful, spiritual
being for doing that.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's who you are.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy it.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy being who you are.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And whether you are a
scientist or a Mother Teresa

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:84%
or a monk on a mountaintop,
we're all spiritual.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We're all equal.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's less about
the rituals rules

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
or even-- where you
religious in the past?

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with
parents who taught me

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:90%
many Hindu rituals and things.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of rituals.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are
a lot of rituals.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, because I had such
a mixed cultural upbringing,

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.200 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things brought
me a lot of fear,

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:84%
because I learned
many Chinese things.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I learned many Western things,
like Western religious things.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:84%
I was in a Catholic school
for a very short time.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things
contradict each other.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's what caused
a lot of fear in me,

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is that you cannot
spend your whole

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:84%
life just doing rituals of every
possible religion and culture.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you're exposed to
so many, what do you do?

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you follow?

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that pure state
that I was in that I realized

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.280 align:middle line:84%
no matter what, even
if I don't follow

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.070 align:middle line:84%
a single ritual for
the rest of my life,

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:90%
I am still a spiritual being.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm still a divine,
magnificent spiritual being who

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.740 align:middle line:90%
deserves to live a joyful life.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:90%
And that was the discovery.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.860 align:middle line:84%
In Hindu traditions,
there's a lot of the karma.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.840 align:middle line:90%
You speak a lot of the karma.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Did you think at some point
that you had this because

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.540 align:middle line:84%
of your karma, because
you had been a bad girl

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:84%
in this life and past lives?
-Yeah.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:90%
I had thought many things.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I partly believed it
was because of my karma.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hated that
feeling, because when

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:84%
you feel it's your
karma, you feel there's

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:90%
nothing you can do about it.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I deserve it because
of something I

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
did in a past life, which
I don't even remember,

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.760 align:middle line:90%
but I deserve it.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I had different people
tell me different things.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.080 align:middle line:84%
There were people that
said, oh, you created it.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Your thoughts created it.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And that made me really
scared of my thoughts.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, my God.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:90%
My thoughts created this?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So I started to get really
scared of my thoughts.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there were all these
things that really scared me.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And in that awake state was
when I realized that all

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.090 align:middle line:90%
I have to do is love myself.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not my thoughts
about cancer and so on.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.496 align:middle line:84%
But it starts from first,
how do I feel about myself?

00:41:20.496 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Do I love and respect myself
that I don't allow other people

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to abuse me, or do I
forsake myself or do

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I treat myself like a doormat?

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's that.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing yourself to be
the magnificence that you are.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:84%
What I find amazing and
I've witnessed quite often

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:84%
in what I do is that when we
give ourselves the permission

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.080 align:middle line:84%
to do something, or, oh,
today I deserve a massage,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.280 align:middle line:84%
or today I deserve this, and
you really treat yourself

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:57.030 align:middle line:84%
with love, then there
is this instantaneous--

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I would receive a check or
something to compensate that,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.380 align:middle line:84%
like immediately the
universe saying, yeah.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.910 align:middle line:90%
But you did the first step.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.131 align:middle line:84%
The universe confirms
to you that you--

00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:10.570 align:middle line:84%
-Once you do it.
-Yeah.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.269 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:11.269 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Because first you have to kind
of say, I'm worthy of this.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the
universe will confirm

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:90%
that to you, that you are.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But if you say, oh,
I'm not worthy of it--

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for a sign.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm waiting for a sign.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to come,
because if you're waiting

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.710 align:middle line:84%
it means you don't
feel you're worthy.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.460 align:middle line:84%
You want something from
the outside to show you

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:90%
you're worthy.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:35.061 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel it and know
it and know it from in here.

00:42:35.061 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:90%
You're worthy.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you
exist-- life is a gift.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:90%
It's an absolute gift.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
you have this gift,

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.305 align:middle line:84%
you are one lucky,
magnificent human being.

00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
treat it that way.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And so just live
life to the fullest.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do that
and find that place of joy,

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the universe will
actually match it.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:90%
It'll confirm it to you.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've been living
the other way around.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.660 align:middle line:84%
We've been doing, doing,
doing, in order to have

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and then be one day happy.
-Yes.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is the problem.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we do
a lot of the rituals

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.344 align:middle line:84%
and when we say, oh,
if I do this, or maybe

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I have to pray harder,
or maybe I have

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:90%
to do more of these rituals--

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:90%
More, more, more, more, more.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.640 align:middle line:90%
More, more, more, yeah.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's not happening.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:24.125 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do more this.

00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Just stop.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Stop everything.

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Just say, I deserve it.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.299 align:middle line:84%
I exist.
I deserve it.

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start by
doing it for myself.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
giving myself.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And then just watch.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I love that you're
wearing you're little eye.

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.770 align:middle line:84%
This is my Turkish
evil eye, my magic eye.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:45.420 align:middle line:90%
So you're still superstition?

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.480 align:middle line:90%
You know, yes and no.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I love it because of
the color and the shape.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'll tell you the
most interesting thing.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like a reminder.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The day I got the
email from Hay House

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to say that Wayne
Dyer had read my story

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to publish my
book was my birthday last year.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.110 align:middle line:90%
It arrived on my birthday.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was the day
I got this as well.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of always
takes me back to that day.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.980 align:middle line:84%
That day, I burst out
crying and I thought, wow.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.740 align:middle line:90%
This is the purpose I came back.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.340 align:middle line:90%
This is the reason.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And this always just
reminds me of my purpose

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.540 align:middle line:90%
here and why I've come back.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Those are not so much--
because before that, I

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.900 align:middle line:84%
feel like we used to have things
because it was protecting us

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.830 align:middle line:84%
or because it was
still again outside.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's more
reminders to just remind

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:84%
us of those beautiful stories,
of those beautiful moments,

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of how life can be magnificent
instead of fear-based.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, if this
was a superstitious,

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:84%
fear-based thing, if I took
it off I would feel fearful.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I would feel fearful
and unprotected.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the case,
because a couple of times when

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to wear
another necklace,

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I do for an occasion
or something.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This is usually the
one I have on mostly.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But every now and
then, I'll take

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:90%
it off and wear something else.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a couple of
friends actually comment

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.145 align:middle line:84%
and say, you're not
wearing the eye,

00:45:16.145 --> 00:45:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and don't you feel unprotected?

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they think that
because of the things

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that have happened
with the book and all,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:90%
that I need to protect myself.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I say no, that's got
nothing to do with it.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You do not need
anymore outside gurus?

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.590 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't need outside gurus.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:84%
There will always be,
I will say, teachers.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There will always be
people, different people,

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.600 align:middle line:84%
who will come into my
life who will say what

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I need to hear in that moment.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't make anybody
more superior than you.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
When you have somebody, you
see-- the fact that the person

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is still here in the
physical, in this world,

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.810 align:middle line:84%
it means they still
have some work to do.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:05.790 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:90%
We're all here.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.230 align:middle line:90%
We're all in it together.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We're all evolving
the planet together.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.200 align:middle line:90%
We're all in it together.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're at the final minutes
of this beautiful interview.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants this
interview to end.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to finish on
this high note about this--

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:27.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever your message is
about this magnificent life

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.130 align:middle line:84%
possibilities that we can
live, that you have lived,

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:33.421 align:middle line:90%
that you felt, that you know.

00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I would actually want
everybody to know that you are

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.980 align:middle line:90%
an amazing, magnificent being.

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.350 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what you
believe, that many of us

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:84%
feel we have to work hard to be
better, to be more spiritual.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know that
you already are everything

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.490 align:middle line:90%
you are trying to attain.

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to be yourself,
go out, and live your life

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:90%
joyfully and with abandon.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid
to be who you are.

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:10.230 align:middle line:84%
-Just relax, breathe, be, smile.
-Smile.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Smile, breathe, be.

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Laugh, and learn to laugh.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.640 align:middle line:84%
It's important to have
a good sense of humor.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Laugh at life and
laugh at yourself.

and wanting to live

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:84%
life more fully each day.
