00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello my
delicious co-creators.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here-- I'm in England, in
London, with the British expert

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:84%
on happiness and love because
your latest book is not

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:90%
on happiness this time.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that you
wrote many of them

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and they were truly an
international success.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw you even on
Oprah-- oh my goodness.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, a lot of
writers dream about that one.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
What an experience, huh?

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.833 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBERT HOLDEN: Yeah,
it was a great experience.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I have to say Oprah
is-- she's amazing.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean she encourages all
of us to live our best life.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's about.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:90%
That's what she does.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was a thrill to be
on her show, definitely.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So you're one of
the big Hay House authors.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And you dealt with the
topic of happiness,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and that we can cover, of
course, and that's part,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.218 align:middle line:84%
I think, of what we
are all looking for--

00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to be happy in life,
to live fulfilled life,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to live juicy lives,
as I like to call it.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
But you wrote your latest book,
the one that is actually out,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:90%
"Lovability," is on love.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%
What is love?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Is love the purpose of life?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Tell us everything.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Are we love machines?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: That's so
good-- a are we machines?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are Lilou.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:90%
We are love machines.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's all
about ultimately.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Look, I created a
Happiness Project

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
all the way back in 1992.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So I've been looking at
happiness for that long.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I created a project called
Success Intelligence way back

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
in 1996-- two big meditations,
a meditation on happiness

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and a meditation on success.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And guess what we
kept coming back to?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:90%
We kept coming back to love.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Love is the heart of happiness.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Love is the heart of success.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So it just made sense eventually
just to put my focus on love.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So I created a project
called "Lovability"--

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
knowing how to love and be
loved-- both sides of the coin.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And "Lovability" actually
is a three day program.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's the sort
of program I would

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
have loved to have gone
on as a teenager in my 20s

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and in my 30s.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I would have loved to have had
a program like that where we can

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.900 align:middle line:84%
actually just talk about love,
get clear about what love is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and what it isn't
because fundamentally I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
do believe that your
relationship to love

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
influences every other
relationship in your life.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So your relationship to love
influences your relationship

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.805 align:middle line:84%
to your body, to your soul, to
sugar, to money, to everything.

00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
clearer about love,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
then I think it just
clears your life up.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So what is
it and what it is not?

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:90%
What isn't love?

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: That's a good place
to start actually because love,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
being the nature that it
is, you can't define it

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
because it's too big
for a definition.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
But what you can say is we know
that love isn't a word, even

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:90%
though you can speak about it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I love the story
of your daughter that says,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.547 align:middle line:90%
daddy that can be just it.

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: I know, that's right.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:84%
My daughter Bo, she was
4 and 1/2 at the time,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
she heard I was
writing a book on love.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
She ran all the way up
the stairs up to my office

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the house--
daddy, daddy I want to write.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to write.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said, great, let's start.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.498 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to learn?

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'd like to
learn how to write love.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:90%
So we did.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We sat down on the floor, and we
did it for the very first time.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
We did the L, and the
O, and the V, and the E.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sweetheart,
there it is.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.483 align:middle line:90%
That's love.

00:03:42.483 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:90%
And she said, really?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.895 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And she was so excited she
got up and she was cheering.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.324 align:middle line:90%
And I cheered with her.

00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, she
looked back at the word,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and she said, daddy, daddy,
are you sure that's love?

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.246 align:middle line:84%
And I went, yeah,
yeah, that's it.

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
no-- are you sure?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.694 align:middle line:84%
And I went, sweetheart,
you've done it.

00:03:58.694 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
daddy, that's not love.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%
That's just a word.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And the look she gave me
was like I was looking

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
into the eyes of a
Zen master, you know?

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.127 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- that's just a word.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:12.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:90%
You have to get past the word.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You know there's 6,909
languages on the planet-- I've

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:90%
done my research.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And all of those languages
have different words for love.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have to remember that
love is more than just a word.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We also have to understand that
love is more than just an idea.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
You can think about it,
but you can't get your head

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:90%
around love.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
If you try to get
your head around love,

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
you'll just end
up with a headache

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
put your heart into it.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Love has an energy about it, but
it's more than just an energy.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, if we
were to cut to the quick,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I would just say
that I think love

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:90%
is our original state of mind.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's us when
we're not being neurotic.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's us when we know
we're connected to everything.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
It's us when we're
not judging ourselves,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
when we're not afraid.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So this love is much, much
more than just an emotion,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:90%
an idea, and a word.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you really go for
it and you put yourself

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle of
love, you find yourself,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:84%
you find out who you
are, what's important,

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly,
you also have

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
something that now
can help you to grow.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I do think
love is our destiny.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I think-- and by that
I mean that not only

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that we will find love,
but actually that we

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
have to embrace love in
order to fulfill our destiny.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
How can you be truly
successful without love?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.049 align:middle line:84%
How can you be truly happy
without love or truly abundant

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
without love?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
So "Lovability" is just this
great meditation on love.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I got to write the
book about it finally,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm really
pleased that I did.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it's out now.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Could we say that
as human beings when we have

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.230 align:middle line:84%
suffering, it's directly
related to how much love,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.360 align:middle line:84%
or how much compassion, or how
much we can just be in that

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:90%
moment just embracing?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Because there seems to be
like this general awakening

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
happening on Earth, and
it's directly related

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to the opening of
the heart somehow.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering what
relationship is there

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
between the love
and the suffering

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that humanity is
experiencing right now?

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.795 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Well,
listening to you,

00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of Caroline
Myss who has-- I mean,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Caroline speaks
beautifully on love.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know, we were
actually at a conference

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
last year on love,
magic, and miracles.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I heard her say
that your suffering is

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
a direct result of the
fact that you do not

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.287 align:middle line:90%
let yourself love enough.

00:06:56.287 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, how about that?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:90%
That's quite a statement.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
truth in it, I really do.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's actually
when we withdraw from love,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
it's when we step
away from love,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it's when we become
afraid of love

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that we actually suffer
more and that actually

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
the key to our
healing, our happiness,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and to our
flourishing is somehow

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:84%
is to put life right in the
center of our life, you know?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We have to put love
right there and not just

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
see it as an extra
thing in our life,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but actually that it is
the heart of our life.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And actually to let--
I think it's Lilou,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
it's to let love
be as big as it is.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: It's scary.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Well, it's-- I tell
you, it's scary to the ego.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It's scary to our self-images,
our self-images that

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:90%
are not made of love.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But what I would
say is that I think

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
to our heart and the
truth of who we are,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
it's a blessed relief
when we finally

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
admit to ourselves
how important love is,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're not embarrassed
to talk about it,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and that we will take love
into any conversation anywhere.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's been the
great joy of my work

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is I worked with for instance
Dove and the Real Beauty

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Campaign.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I was the coach of the last
two presidents of Dove.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.994 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
conversation on love.

00:08:20.994 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And look what we
did in the world.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:90%
We created a beautiful program.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with
the conversation

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
about love in many businesses,
many organizations,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
in politics, in
education, in health care.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:38.250 align:middle line:84%
When you put love on the agenda,
things happen, and you do well.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
time for all of us

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
who are leaders in
the world to feel OK

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
about a conversation about
love and get going with it.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.685 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: We often
think of love--

00:08:50.685 --> 00:08:54.767 align:middle line:84%
or some people out there
might feel this fluffy, lovey,

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But love is so
powerful isn't it?

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Love can say no.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Love is
ultimately, again,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
our true power.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I often say that
actually nobody really

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:90%
will survive love.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is that no self-image

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:90%
is going to survive love.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is your
neuroses won't survive love,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
your old stories
won't survive love,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
holding on to your wounds,
your self-judgments,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:90%
your self-criticism.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Love is honestly just going
to blow all of that away.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:90%
No wonder we're scared of love.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:84%
The good news is though as
it blows all of that away,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.645 align:middle line:90%
it reveals who we really are.

00:09:35.645 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's important for
us to be able to do that.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.485 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Can we
say that love is God?

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: Yes, definitely.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a tradition in Hinduism
called Bhakti Yoga-- Bhakti

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, the yogi of devotion
actually said, straight up,

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.750 align:middle line:84%
look, just love is
God and God is love.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Jesus said the same thing.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Ramanna has said the same thing.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Marvin Gaye has said
the same thing, yay.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Ram Dass.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: Ram Dass, absolutely.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah I mean I
think honestly when

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
you-- this is what
inquiry is for.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Inquiry is to go past the word.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So when you go
past the word, when

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
you see what the word
love is pointing to

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and you see what the word God is
pointing to, and you feel it--

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I think they're pointing to
the same thing ultimately.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's a
wonderful thing for us to do.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And part of the conversation
about love at the moment

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
has to be, I
believe, that we stop

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
peddling a fearful god
in the world, you know,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
a god that we're all afraid of.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
The universe, on some level,
is held up, and created,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and supported by love.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.580 align:middle line:90%
That seems to be the case.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Underneath that periodic
table of all those elements

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and everything else,
right there is love.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we tune
into that, then we

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
find out more about who
we are, what creation is.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:90%
There's an intelligence there.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
This is what I love
the most Lilou,

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
is that love is intelligent.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
When you tune into love, love
will show you how to love.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Love will show you how to live.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Love will show
you how to create.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I
mean by the idea

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that I think love is
like our true nature.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
It's our real mind
minus the neuroses.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It's intelligent,
and you can ask love

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
how to guide you, and
inspire you, and bless you

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.949 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
same as praying to God.

00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can pray to
god, you can pray

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
to love-- I think you're
praying to the same thing.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So when we're kids, we
love, we love, we run, we fall,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
we raise -- rise. we just
naturally play with life.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So at which moment
do we lose that

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and how can we go back to it?

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it a matter of healing?

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.865 align:middle line:90%
Is it a matter of praying?

00:11:51.865 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Well,
in "Lovability,"

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:90%
I talk about the basic drama.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And the basic drama is
between the basic truth

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and the basic fear.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The basic truth is
what our soul believes,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and the basic truth is I am
lovable and you are lovable.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is not only lovable,
but it's like made of love.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So St. Francis of
Assisi would call

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:90%
this your eternal loveliness.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Merton would call
it your secret beauty.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:90%
This is your loveliness.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that basic truth
is obscured by a basic doubt.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The basic doubt
is, am I lovable?

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
That then becomes the basic
fear-- I'm not lovable.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
The moment I think I'm not
lovable, the myth of inadequacy

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And the myth of inadequacy
is I'm not good enough,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not beautiful enough,
I'm not smart enough,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not strong enough,
I'm not successful enough.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.330 align:middle line:84%
But it all comes, I
believe, from the basic fear

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
that we're not lovable.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So fundamentally my work
is about saying that,

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
actually, if you can
heal that basic fear--

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and part of the healing is to
know that it's only a fear.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: How do you see fear?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember Jack Canfield
saying its false evidence

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
appearing real.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah, I think
that's pretty good.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
fear fundamentally

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
comes from the separated state.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning
Lilou, when we arrived,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
we felt like we were
part of everything.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
We felt like we were
part of the whole show.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in there,
we experienced

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
what Einstein calls
the optical delusion.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
We started to think we were
separate from everything.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle line:84%
In the separation, we experience
the fall from grace, you know?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
That fall from
grace-- just that fall

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
from that state of
loveliness, you know?

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And somehow from
the separation, I

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:90%
think that's when we get afraid.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's when we
start to go, oh my God.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Am I on my own here?

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Does anybody care?

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Can anybody see who I am?

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.474 align:middle line:90%
Is anybody going to love me?

00:13:58.474 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
what we do, instead

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
of realizing the
we're lovable, we

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
try to make ourselves lovable.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes the most
exhausting project of our life

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.994 align:middle line:84%
is trying to make
ourselves lovable.

00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when you try to
make yourself lovable,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you have to sign up
for self-improvement.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And everybody who's ever
done self-improvement

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
knows that it's exhausting, and
that it doesn't really work,

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're always left feeling
like there's more to improve.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So my work is about
helping people

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to give up self-improvement
for self-acceptance.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And self-acceptance
starts with the idea

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that whilst your self-image
doesn't necessarily

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
feel lovable, the
essence of who you are

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:90%
knows it is made of love.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:90%
That's the beginning.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So how do we deal with
that in day to day life when we

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
encounter a problem,
a challenge,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:84%
a situation that we so know
there's an immediate reaction.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:90%
How can you just disconnect?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear of
meditation and interviewing

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:84%
neuroscientists-- you
know-- Joe Dispenza,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:84%
he'll tell you that
neuroplasticity--

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
little by little, your
brain will rewire.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But how do you get to
that point where you can--

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah, sure-- I mean
if we talk about self-love

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
for a moment because that's
a huge subject isn't it?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Self-love, most often
in my experience,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
begins as a conversation
with what can I

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
do that's good for me?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
What can I do
that's nice for me?

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So self-love could be
visiting your yoga mat.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
It could be doing meditation.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It could be being in nature.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be having a bubble
bath, organic chocolate--

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
you know, that's good.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's not really where
I think self-love actually

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:90%
starts.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
That's where
self-love is a verb.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It's something I'm
doing for myself.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that
self-love ultimately

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
is an awareness that
you're made of love.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And Lilou, if you feel that
for a moment, if that's true--

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
not just an idea,
but true-- then

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
that must mean
that our real self

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
loves us very much already.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
learn to love ourselves.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
All we have to
do, ultimately, is

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to remember that our
soul, our essence

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:90%
already loves us deeply.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if our soul
already loves us deeply,

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
then it would stand to reason
that our soul is trying

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to guide us, and inspire us,
and bless us every single day.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately
what we have to do

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is to try to find a
way to tune into that.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
meditation is for.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
walk in nature is

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
for or visiting the
yoga mat is for.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Our essence loves us.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And it wants to guide us.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It wants to support us.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, I
think it starts almost

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
with an act of
listening and noticing

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
that voice for fear,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that voice of judgment
in our head if you like,

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
versus also this voice for
love, which it might sound

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
like a quiet voice
at first, but that's

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:84%
only because we haven't been
listening to it very much.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.834 align:middle line:84%
As we listen to that voice
more, it becomes so clear

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
that you know when you're
following love or following

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.880 align:middle line:90%
something else after a while.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:90%
You feel it in your belly.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You feel it here.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
You get tense if
you don't follow it.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
That voice is clear,
really-- especially when

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:90%
we pay attention to it.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: And at the
beginning of the beginning,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
how can we get a proof like
for the more rational minds?

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
How can we really know for
sure that that's our essence?

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's
such a trauma,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:84%
it's nearly impossible
to get there.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Or every time there's something,
we just disconnect to it

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:90%
and go back?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
We are talking here
of real life change.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Completely-- and you
probably wouldn't be able to do

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that on your own, because,
again, you have those traumas.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Those traumas come from
the separated state.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So my feeling is that
nobody really heals alone.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I think what happens
is that bit by bit,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
you put a new mirror
in front of you.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You find a great book, and
you read something in it.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds like the truth.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is by
the way, when something sounds

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:84%
like the truth,
it's not really new.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're
remembering something.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like an old song
or an old language.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And you're going, I know this.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I know this is true.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe you meet somebody
or maybe you go on a seminar

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:90%
or you go in a workshop.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And bit by bit, you
recreate your mirror.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you recreate
your mirror, I

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.804 align:middle line:84%
think what happens is
you have the confidence

00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
to accept the possibility that
you're not the odd one out.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
That this could all be
true for everybody else,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.950 align:middle line:84%
but what if it isn't
true for me, you know?

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody has that
what "A Course in Miracles"

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
calls the special guilt,
the special unworthiness.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's made of
love, except for me.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm the exception to that.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%
So we're afraid.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We've lost our
trust, if you like,

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:84%
that we could listen
to that voice,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:90%
that we could let love guide us.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, bit by bit-- and
it is a journey-- we come home.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:90%
We come home to ourselves.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And, hey, whatever
works-- whether it's

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
reading one of my
books, whether it's

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
watching your interviews--
that's why we do this isn't it?

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.869 align:middle line:90%
To help each other come home.

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: A lot of people
are looking for their purpose

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Do we really need to
be specific for you

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
as soon as we are loving and
loving ourselves, and accepting

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.607 align:middle line:90%
ourselves, we are on purpose?

00:19:55.607 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Oh, purpose is a
great conversation isn't it?

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You know my feeling is that
when people explore purpose,

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
they often jump into
purpose too quickly.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing to do is
leave the word purpose alone

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is you step
back from that word

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and try and look at
it in another way.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, at
the Happiness Project,

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
following your joy.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Happiness
Project essentially

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
helps people to give up
the search for happiness

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and to start
following their joy.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
So you can start there.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.870 align:middle line:90%
What really brings me joy?

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:90%
When am I at my happiest?

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, that would be clue
as to your purpose.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Similarly with
"Lovability," when

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.770 align:middle line:84%
you let yourself, as Rumi
said, be drawn by love,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
be pulled by love, what is
it that I truly, truly love?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, that will give
you an idea of what maybe

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
your purpose really is.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
You could look at
it another way.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
On success intelligence,
we look at aliveness.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell
said, people are not

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.360 align:middle line:84%
looking for the meaning
of life, what they're

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.501 align:middle line:84%
looking for is an
experience of aliveness.

00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:90%
I think that's so good.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.385 align:middle line:84%
And so to ask
yourself a question

00:21:20.385 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
like, when do I really feel
alive-- I mean truly alive?

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.152 align:middle line:84%
When like that
just energy is just

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
coursing through
my body and my body

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is big I want to sing an opera
even if I can't because I'm

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:90%
that alive.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That will give you an idea
of what your purpose is.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
If you don't connect to
joy, love, and aliveness,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and go straight for
purpose, usually I

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
think what happens is it becomes
just an intellectual exercise

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.006 align:middle line:84%
where you get lost in your
fear of not having a purpose.

00:21:50.006 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
for some people it

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
takes so long for them
to find a purpose.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So since you wrote
many books on happiness,

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.434 align:middle line:84%
you know and the shift,
and "Shift Happens."

00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: "Shift Happens"--
yeah, I wrote "Shift Happens"

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in 1999, right on the verge of
the Millennium when I wanted

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to look at really how are
we being called to grow.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:84%
That was the point
behind "Shift Happens."

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got a new book coming
out now called "Holy Shift,"

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.834 align:middle line:90%
so 11 years later--

00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So the one you're
writing with Louise Hay?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: No, no this one--

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Another one.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.729 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: No, "Holy
Shift"-- yeah, "Holy Shift"

00:22:24.729 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
is actually my homage to
"A Course in Miracles."

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been a student of "A Course
in Miracles" for 20 years.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I've done the lessons
daily for 20 years.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:90%
It's my desert island book.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So "Holy Shift"
is 365 meditations

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:90%
from "A Course in Miracles."

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
"A Course in Miracles"
describes a shift in perception

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.184 align:middle line:84%
from fear to love
as being the miracle

00:22:48.184 --> 00:22:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
experience in our lives.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:51.390 align:middle line:90%
So there's that one.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
The book with Louise Hay is
one that I'm writing absolutely

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Life Loves You."

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.921 align:middle line:84%
I'm super excited to be
writing that with her.

00:22:59.921 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So we're very much
around the topic of love.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Its interesting that you
started from the happiness

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and now that you're
at the love, do

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:84%
you feel that's really the
conversation to have right now

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all
opening up to it?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean why is it coming now?

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's quite interesting since
a lot of people are saying,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
this planet is shifting.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us are
experiencing and want

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to experience more
at a time where

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.464 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of suffering.

00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think the key is-- I'm
a big fan really of inquiry

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:90%
and conversation.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
can think for yourself

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and you can get involved
in conversations,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that's a wonderful,
wonderful thing.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I think we evolve
through conversations.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully that's
what happens to us

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:90%
when we're speaking.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.036 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully that's
what happens when

00:23:43.036 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
people are watching us speak
or watching your interviews.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Literally, we evolve through the
conversations we dare to have.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We're held back by the
conversations we won't have.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So the conversation is
the important thing.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:84%
When I created the
Happiness Project in 1992

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.260 align:middle line:84%
on the National Health Service
in the UK, very few of us

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:90%
were talking about happiness.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the mission statement
was simply, talk happiness.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Come on everybody, let's
start talking about it

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.520 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't do that,
where are we going to go?

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Similarly with
Success Intelligence,

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create
a project where

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:90%
we could talk about success.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
My experience was
that a lot of us

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
were working hard
at success, but we

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
hadn't worked out
what success is.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Similarly with love--
I mean my great hope

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
would be that we could
be able to engage

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in conversations about loving
classrooms at school, where we

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
could get children to
draw love, to paint love,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
to act out love
in a play, or just

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel as if they
could talk about it, you know?

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, I
would like love to be

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.990 align:middle line:90%
on the syllabus in psychiatry.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I would like love to be on
the syllabus in medicine,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:84%
in politics,
everywhere because we

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:90%
need to talk about these things.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:05.049 align:middle line:84%
If we're afraid to
talk about them,

00:25:05.049 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
make any progress.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.135 align:middle line:84%
So the conversation's
the key really.

00:25:10.135 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Yeah, it's like I
just came back from Barcelona

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to make some lovely
interviews with some artist.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And he translated it
so well in his picture.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Just instead of running
after the love, to just be

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.180 align:middle line:90%
love ourselves.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And the rest doesn't
really matter.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.022 align:middle line:84%
Just being in a loving
moment-- that's the core.

00:25:27.022 --> 00:25:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: I love
that, absolutely.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I begin "Lovability"
by sharing a conversation

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I had with one of my clients
who was looking for love.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
looking for love really

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
is hell because when
you're looking for love,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:90%
you're acting cool.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.200 align:middle line:84%
But also when you're
looking for love,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
you have essentially placed
love outside of yourself.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the conversation with
my client, I was saying,

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
really make a shift

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
from looking for love
to actually being

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
a more loving person.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And the goal I gave
her was I said, look,

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.070 align:middle line:84%
if you really want
to love someone,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
you have to start by being
willing to love everyone.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great conversation
because she said, well,

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:90%
so do you mean date everyone.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, no, not date
everyone-- love everybody.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the nature of love.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Love doesn't pick and
choose between us--

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:84%
not when it's the big
love, not when we're

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
talking about love that's
more than just romance.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Love comes from oneness.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
That means love loves everybody.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:84%
When we commit to being a more
loving person in the world,

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:84%
when we commit to loving
everybody just a little bit

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:44.400 align:middle line:84%
more, that's when romance shows
up and romance stands a chance.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're not interested in
loving anybody particularly,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
but you're looking for
one person to love,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.487 align:middle line:84%
I mean, frankly, romance
is going to show up.

00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
honeymoon period that

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
will last from somewhere between
three months and three minutes,

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and it all goes to hell.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that story.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's had that experience.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Romance--

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Bruce Lipton speaks
a lot of that beautiful book--

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Honeymoon Effect.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah,
absolutely beautiful.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Bruce-- and I'm a huge
fan of Bruce's work.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And gorgeous man
as well isn't he?

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:90%
He's just terrific.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And I love how he
speaks about love.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But that's the point,
that fundamentally when

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.500 align:middle line:84%
we're willing to
love everybody more,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.474 align:middle line:84%
that's what will help
us to love somebody.

00:27:29.474 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But at the same time,
it feels like there's some

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:37.160 align:middle line:84%
people that we meet that are
off-- it could feel like off.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we decide not
to encounter or not take

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the chance in that relationship,
that friendship, that business

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
part of the no also

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
fully experience it.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So how do we deal with
saying no to somebody

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and being OK with that?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:28:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean still time feels limited
in some ways in this lifetime.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah,
well, love can--

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.885 align:middle line:84%
if you were to have a
decision in front of you,

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:84%
you could meditate
on that decision.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You could ask love, hey,
what should I do here?

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think love, many
times, can say, well, bless

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:90%
that person and say no.

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean that's fine, you know?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I think the big thing is
when we love ourselves,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:84%
our decisions come
from love rather than

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
from pleasing people,
from trying to be nice.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I mean?

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:34.610 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think love is
where our true strength is

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and our true power is.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think love would have us
bless everybody in our life,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean we have
to go to lunch with everybody.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we
have to give our phone

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:90%
number to everybody.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean we have
to work with everybody-- not

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Love is discerning.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Very different from
the peace and love movement.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:51.701 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:51.701 --> 00:28:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But the peace and
love movement was

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I think also just an attempt
to get clearer about love

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and to put the
conversation out there.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And it did.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
It did do that, didn't it?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it just
raised the conversation

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.635 align:middle line:90%
let's talk more about love.

00:29:11.635 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Any other aspect
that you would like to mention

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
as part of "Lovability" or
living from this place on a day

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.210 align:middle line:90%
to day basis?

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Well, on
the three day program--

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.970 align:middle line:84%
which we've just
run one in New York.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.700 align:middle line:90%
That was great fun.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that comes
up a lot is forgiveness.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.230 align:middle line:90%
We have to talk about that.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
fundamentally most of us

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
have been put off by
love for one reason

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.900 align:middle line:90%
or another in our life.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I tried to show in
"Lovability" and in my work

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:90%
is that love has never hurt us.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not love that hurts.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the unloving things
that we do to ourselves

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:90%
in the name of love that hurts.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
that without forgiveness, we

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:90%
will be afraid of love.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we
will search for love,

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
or we'll say we're
searching for love,

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go 10 years
without a relationship.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you have
to wonder, well, why is that?

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking for and not
finding it, what's happening?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
What's often happening-- not
always-- but what's happening

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
is that, actually,
I'm afraid to find it

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because I associate
it with a fear.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I associate it with a wound.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.415 align:middle line:84%
When we can see through
the eyes of forgiveness

00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that love has never
hurt us, that's

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:84%
enormous because
that can help us

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to see that really
love isn't something

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.952 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid of as such.

00:30:42.952 --> 00:30:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect that we
look at with forgiveness

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that there's no
such thing as a broken heart.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Now again, that's something
that forgiveness can show us.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not an intellectual idea.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:84%
That's an experience
you have when

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.210 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see
over time that it

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
wasn't your heart
that got broken.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Expectations got broken.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:90%
Hopes got broken.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Great dreams of the
future got broken.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Promises got broken.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Things that we identified
with, but fundamentally

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:90%
that it wasn't us that broke.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the heart
that got broken.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's incredibly
important to get

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:84%
because when you can see that
the essence of who you are

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.110 align:middle line:84%
doesn't break, that's what can
help you return to that place,

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and come into the present
again, and saying,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.820 align:middle line:90%
hello love, here I am again.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to
give it another go.

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But it seems
that it's addictive.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.451 align:middle line:84%
There's part of this love,
like in a relationship, when

00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
stops that we miss.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
more this thing--

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
that's what we cry for isn't it?

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Can we be addicted to it or
does that mean that's not really

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:90%
love?

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.461 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: Well, it isn't love.

00:31:58.461 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not love.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a tragic relationship to
something that looks like love.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:04.940 align:middle line:90%
But that's not love.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:90%
That's not how love works.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Love would have no interest
in causing any pain.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's just not how it is.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I think what
happens is though is

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:90%
we create an image of ourselves.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And that image of
ourselves becomes familiar.

00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we have our story,
and our story becomes us.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things about
healing and particularly about

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
love is that sometimes you
have to give up your story.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.785 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
willing to say, look,

00:32:35.785 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that happened to me in my past.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
That's something to be
honored, but it's not me.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not my whole story.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think at some point, you
may find that you have a choice

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to make between the sweet
tragedy of wounded romances,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
which you can hold onto and
maybe write some good love

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.850 align:middle line:84%
songs about and some good
poems about, which is fine.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But even then, it's still really
only a phase of your life.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
At some point, I
think we're asked

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.780 align:middle line:84%
to let go, and step into a
new chapter into our life,

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.342 align:middle line:84%
and create a new story
in our life as well.

00:33:17.342 --> 00:33:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So what is the
best way to create a miracle

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
or to witness a miracle--
to be part of it?

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.294 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Good question-- I
suppose there's maybe a context

00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:90%
for all of that.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
starting point is

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to remember that we're lovable.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
When you remember that, then
you can start to let life

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.940 align:middle line:84%
love you, which is what we're
looking at really, Louise

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and I, in this book.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The whole point
of life loves you,

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.570 align:middle line:84%
which is one of Louise's
great affirmations,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:84%
is to consider the possibility
that life accepts you,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that life affirms you,
that that which created

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:84%
you wants you to
live your best life.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:90%
That's quite an idea.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the same conclusion that
Einstein came to when he said,

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
all of my work
has been exploring

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:90%
is the universe friendly or not?

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Is it a friendly universe?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Does life support us?

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's such a
shift in conversation.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:84%
That's exact shift
we were talking

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:84%
about earlier between
fear and love.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Totally,
totally-- it's a massive one.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
For most of us, we
think of ourselves

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.760 align:middle line:84%
as independent
entities in the world.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:84%
So we become self-reliant,
self-sufficient,

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and we try to do
life by ourselves.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have varying
degrees of success with that.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.659 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
our independence

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:90%
is the block to success.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the block to happiness.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the block to love.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to
give up the independence.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's counter-cultural.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Right now, independence is
meant to be the great new power,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.435 align:middle line:84%
the great new strength--
everybody be independent.

00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:06.560 align:middle line:90%
That's not what I'm saying.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying you've
got to find a way

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to be interdependent
with something.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you've
got to find a way

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:84%
to be dependent on something
greater than your own ego.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's often the independence
that holds us back.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And part of it
that holds us back

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is forgetting that maybe
life is on our side.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe life wants
the best for us.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And if we were just to
tune in and just listen

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
for the messages, and the
signs, and the synchronicities,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
that happen around us,

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe we would see that there
is a bigger plan than our own,

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that there is a kindness in the
design, as my friend Michael

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Neal says, and that there
is an intelligence afoot

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.476 align:middle line:84%
that wants us to
live a good life.

00:35:52.476 --> 00:35:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Then miracles
pop everywhere.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Then the
miracles happen.

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The miracles therefore
being those moments

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
when we see things
differently or when we just

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.010 align:middle line:84%
get given that help from
what Joseph Campbell called

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
the unseen hands,
which happen, too.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Delicious-- thank you
so much for this conversation.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.571 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to
read "Lovability."

00:36:17.571 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> HOLDEN: Good, I'm
pleased, I'm pleased.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It was a thrill to
write that book.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.370 align:middle line:84%
When I finished that book,
I just felt, OK, it's done.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very much how I felt
after "Happiness Now."

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.900 align:middle line:84%
If I've contributed to the
conversation about love

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in some way, I feel
I'm on purpose.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully that's what's
happened with "Lovability."

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Thank
you so much Robert.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And to all delicious
co-creators watching this video,

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:42.400 align:middle line:90%
please comment, please share.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We send you much, much love
from London, delicious London.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.359 align:middle line:90%
>> HOLDEN: City of Love.

00:36:48.359 --> 00:36:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I wasn't seeing it
like that when I had those

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
suffering moments
four years ago,
