00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.100 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLE]

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my delicious
co-creaters.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here on the
magnificent island of Kauai,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the garden island, the magical
island of Kauai for Gaiam TV.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Here with Francesco.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Lilou.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me today.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:90%
What a blessing.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
How beautiful is this
to be in this moment,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
sitting here at the footsteps
of this beautiful mountain,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:90%
the sacred mountain?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is Makaleha.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And the Hawaiians
call this Makaleha.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Makaleha means "to
wander aimlessly,"

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
but in a good way aimlessly.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Not with a purpose,
and an intention,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
and a force, but to wander,
you know, just joyfully.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's something
about this Makaleha Mountain

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:90%
that is great for us today.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're five kilometers from
the wettest spot on the planet.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a blue sky and
absolute, incredible, clear day

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
And the rooster.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:90%
In the background.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
There's always roosters here.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen to
the roosters carefully,

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
they're not saying
cock-a-doodle-do,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:90%
they're saying Makaleha.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
It is really strange.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
energy of a place.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The energy of a place creates
a vibration that everything

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:90%
seems to resonate with.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.502 align:middle line:84%
Next on Gaiam TV, Lilou
interviews a rooster.

00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:32.060 align:middle line:84%
A Hawaiian rooster, not only a
Hawaiian, a Kauaiian rooster.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I feel so really blessed.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I've been in Europe right now.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And to be here in Hawaii
and just sit back down

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:84%
into this beautiful vibration,
this beautiful energy,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:90%
is such a blessing.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful island.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And beauty, spirit just shows
up in such a strong way here.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:90%
We all need ways to rejuvenate.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we go on
holiday to rejuvenate.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we go to
that little sacred place

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that's around the corner
from our house to rejuvenate.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, we have to go inside.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And to me, Qigong is a
way to go on holiday,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.805 align:middle line:90%
a five-minute holiday sometime.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And people think
I'm crazy that way.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot of people
who practice Qigong discover

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
that it's a way to take
those 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and just turn the world
down a little bit,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
turn that volume
down of the world.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And find out and remember
that we are really generating

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:90%
this dream of this world.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And that if we don't go inside
and work on that mechanism

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.734 align:middle line:84%
inside of us that
generates this dreaming,

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
then what's the dreaming
going to look like?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
A bunch of chaos that we seem
to be running after rather

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
than a world that we are
actually participating

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:90%
in from the inside out.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why we need to go

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
on those holidays every day,
a few minutes every day,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to go inside, readjust,
and then watch what happens

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
to the world around you.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:90%
So you're a Qigong instructor.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I know you have made
quite a lot of DVDs,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.461 align:middle line:84%
actually, on Gaiam TV that
is available for you guys

00:02:57.461 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to see it.
It's fantastic.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So much source resource
there on this website.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So how do you describe
Qigong, first of all?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the basics.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Or does that even
maybe-- has this evolved?

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think Qigong
is an evolving thing.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
I studied with masters in China.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in China
for years and had

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
hear other people's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:90%
perspectives of Qigong.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
realize that in my travels

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
in Italy, I heard

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
some old monks talk a
lot about this thing

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:90%
that looked like Qigong.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in Thailand,
and I studied

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%
something called Falun Gong.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds a
lot like Qigong.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're in India, and I
studied different things,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.154 align:middle line:90%
something called [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, that
looked like Qigong.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
realize Qigong really

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of
this universal thing

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that we all do in every
culture, all throughout time.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine the breath,
and when you combine body

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
movements or dance, when you
combine that mental clarity,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, and focus
the Chinese called yi,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:90%
you have Qigong.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.561 align:middle line:84%
So those three
elements make Qigong.

00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
travel around the world,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
you realize that pattern is
reflected in every culture.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to ancient times,
any place, in ancient Rome,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
they had these systems.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.329 align:middle line:84%
So I love Qigong because
it's got a good handle on it

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:90%
from a Chinese perspective.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But I want us all
to remember how

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
it brings us back to the
core of whatever culture

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:90%
we have inside us.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese just packaged
it in a really smart way.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So you mean that
when you travel,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
or if you're doing
Qigong here in Hawaii,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:84%
or over there, or in Italy,
it would look different?

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:90%
It would feel different?

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.130 align:middle line:90%
I think it should.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
If you practice
Qigong from the heart,

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
then wherever you practice
it, you'll be like a rooster

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:90%
singing Makaleha.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
If you check the roosters
out down the road,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:90%
they don't say Makaleha.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Ask any local person.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:90%
It's the funniest thing.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So the vibration of an
area you're in affects you.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.470 align:middle line:84%
You're in Hawaii,
you feel happy.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You're in New York City,
you want to be intense.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
When you're in LA, you
want to listen to music.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it happens to
be, there's logic of why

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
a local vibe sets you off.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But I like to get
people to start

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
thinking, what is it like if you
set that resonance inside you?

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead of reacting to an
externality generated reality,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
suppose you had an
internally generated vibe.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you connected
from a sensitive place

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to what was really
happening in that locale.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.530 align:middle line:90%
So it changes the way you look.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't just become-- I
don't want to say victim--

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
but you don't become an
effect of that place.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
You participate more.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
creates a more empowered

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
way of looking at life.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So tell us more
about how we can

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
feel this because this
world feels chaotic.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are so
much messages or TV.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going right,
left, and more or less

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
living the life of somebody
else instead of our own

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really,
really interested.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everybody
listening is really interested.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.080 align:middle line:84%
How can we get to this place
where, wherever we are,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
whatever's happening on
the outside, we're there,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
we're present,
we're in our hearts?

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that what we all want?

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:90%
It's juicy.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:90%
But it's juicy.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I think the key is
it's about identity.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
If Qigong has done
anything for me

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in these years of
practicing it is

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
to really go back into a
place of redefining who I am.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So if I have a definition
that I am in this world,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and I've got to make
it in this world,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got to fight for my
little piece of the pie.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.385 align:middle line:84%
So it means I fight--
that's effort--

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
for a piece-- that's scarcity.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So there's force and scarcity.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
That is a worldview
that most of us live by.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that I am
this contained body, that I have

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
a certain, finite
amount of years

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, a certain,
finite amount of energy,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I have to get a
certain amount of sleep

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
every night-- all these
rules that I've set up.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we're forgetting is
that we are an energy body,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that at the core
of this whole thing

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:90%
is this fluid, dynamic energy.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And science has been talking
about this more and more.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And right now in 2012, we're
coming to the end of this year,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:84%
there's been so
much great science

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
coming out that is reminding
us on an absolute scientific

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
level-- from
astrophysics to quantum

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:84%
physics-- that are telling
us, hey, we are just energy.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just energy.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
All the problems we've had
with explaining anything

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific level
has been because we've

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
been looking at the
stuff and not looking

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:90%
at the energetic aspect of it.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So it goes back to identity.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:84%
If I can really understand
myself as an energy being,

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
as a light being,
whatever kind of new age

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
label you want to put it,
or go right to science

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and say that I am this fluid,
dynamic field of energy.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And that I have influence
with every thought

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:90%
over that energetic field.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just this
body, I'm this field.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.102 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese call it
the Wei Qi field.

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:90%
That I affect this field.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I go through life, not
just as me against the world,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.770 align:middle line:84%
fighting for that
little piece of the pie,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a field of
energy that integrates

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:90%
with the energy around me.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And that if I can set the tone
of this energy with whatever

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
kind of personal practice I do,
some way to keep reorienting

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that from the inside-out
so that the world around me

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:90%
will change.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole different
vibe from saying manifesting.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to manifest this.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
It drives me crazy when
people talk about that.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Because they get into trouble.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
Ask anybody who has this
manifesting way of thinking,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.847 align:middle line:90%
they're never better than 50%.

00:08:42.847 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody could say, well,
I always get a parking space.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
when you don't?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So you're putting yourself into
a big, troublesome place when

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
you think about manifesting.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you come back to a
place of saying influence,

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:84%
it's a little gentler, and
you flow nicer with it.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Instead of focusing on
one thing out there,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
you start from inside by
setting up this influence

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
vibe of saying, I am
not just this body

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:90%
looking for a parking space.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
In a car, looking
for a parking space,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:90%
setting up that bizarre duality.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.360 align:middle line:90%
But people do it all the time.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I hear people talking
this way all the time.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it's an
evolution, I feel.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.115 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
But from that, let's move.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's move
to another place.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a step, it's an
important step to say

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.090 align:middle line:90%
that I can manifest something.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And we do, in a way.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's changing
words a little bit.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:84%
This is not about creating
an argument around it.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It's about saying like you
said, let's keep taking it up.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
We're in 2012
right now, somebody

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:84%
might be watching this
video in 2015 or some point,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and look at how
things have changed.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.885 align:middle line:84%
So let's put ourselves
into that timeless place

00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:90%
of reorienting our identity.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then say, if I am energy,
and I influence every atom

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
in my body with the
thoughts I have,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and that energy
field of these atoms

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:84%
creates this field
around me, how far out

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:84%
can that field go to ripple, to
influence the world around me?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, how far do
you think it can go?

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.329 align:middle line:84%
Oh.
Infinite.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Because we see it all the time.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
you really shifted

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
a healing inside yourself?

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Like an angry feeling
about a person

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.774 align:middle line:84%
you've carried for
years or something,

00:10:24.774 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and you finally just
said, you know what?

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let it go.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I really send that
person a good thought.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And then a few minutes
later, you get a phone call

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
from them or somebody
else, and you

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
hear something good about it.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And you think,
how'd that happen?

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We all have those
kinds of things.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:42.240 align:middle line:84%
We all have those
experiences of seeing

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
a breakdown of time
and space, where time

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:90%
and space no longer influence.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
That thing that happened in the
past no longer was the past.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:90%
That spatial difference.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
How many times do you
send a text to somebody,

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and they go, oh my god, I
was just thinking of you.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:90%
That happens all the time.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
We're so lucky to have this
technology to bring us back

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
to the Qigong ideas
that we are immersed

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:90%
in an infinite field of energy.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And if we get that idea, then
immersion in this energy field

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
says that we're
connected to everything.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what science
is showing all the time.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Beyond this planet.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Beyond this planet, our
influence, we have no idea.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing right
now in this conversation,

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
with you and me, and with your
listening to this conversation,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
we're creating a field
just by the intention.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
What do the quantum
physics experiments

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:90%
all take into account?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:90%
The observer effect.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Every quantum
physicist has to take

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
into account the people who
are watching the experiment.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The observer effect, just
people watching affect

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:90%
the outcome of the science.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take
responsibility

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.990 align:middle line:84%
for this fact that
we're in a time

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
right now that's
moving really fast.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The energy and the consciousness
is at a really beautiful

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And that we can
influence this world

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:90%
in a deeper and deeper way.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
In ways that your ego doesn't
want to really get a hold on,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.470 align:middle line:90%
it's scary.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it means you have
to take responsibility

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
for what you eat, how you
think, who you hang around with,

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
your attitude toward life.
And guess what?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the language that
the biophysicists are looking

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
at in the world of epigenetics.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is this new
study right now that moves away

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.370 align:middle line:84%
from what actual genes do, but
what the influence of genes

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
have and the influence the
world has on those genes.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.696 align:middle line:84%
And it's talking
about gene expression.

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
You might have read
about gene expression.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the coolest thing.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:90%
No, I haven't.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about
the gene expression.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the coolest thing.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is science,
but it's Qigong.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's the ancient
and the modern coming

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
together in a really cool way.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
bridging those two

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and having the
scientific conversation

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:90%
as part of this too.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
I think you can't discount it.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
But before, we used to.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
We used to separate all of this.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So now it's beautiful to have
this holistic conversation.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be because we
have a new generation of kids.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
These amazing young people are
coming up that I talk with all

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:90%
the time, and they get it.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't know a separation.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a duality
around science, or math,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
or playing music, or swimming
in the ocean, or socializing.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.955 align:middle line:84%
Everything mixes
altogether for them.

00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So we need to come into
that holistic place

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:84%
where the right brain and
the left brain mix together.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The intellectual left brain
and the playful right brain

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
need to converse.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is
this world of looking

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
at how our genes
express themselves

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and how our attitudes
about people,

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and food, and attitude,
and things that we are

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
involved in every
day, affect the way

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:90%
your genes express themselves.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So mostly, what genes do
is they produce proteins.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
And proteins are hormones.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Proteins are part of
our endocrine system.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Proteins are everything.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Our saliva, everything
in our body, pretty much,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is some protein-related
function.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So that means my
life is some level

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
of protein-related muscles
to how the stomach works.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that there
is an influence

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
you have on how the genes
that produce those proteins

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:90%
do their job.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
This is epigenetics.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:90%
"Epi" means "around."

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're not just talking
about the science of genetics,

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
which everybody's been
looking at so hard,

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and trying to study that
specific little gene

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and what does it do.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we're into the
energy field around the gene.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, your thoughts

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
can emplace protein
and different kinds

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
of organic matter
on top of the gene.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So just like putting a
sheath over your eyes,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
you can't see very well-- that's
what epigenetics is about.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The gene can't
express itself and do

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
its job because of
this emplaced protein,

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:90%
emplaced organic matter.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:90%
But guess how you get it away.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.200 align:middle line:90%
You change the way you think.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So attitudes, and
thoughts, and the energy

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
we carry in our everyday
is affecting your body.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Not on a deeply genetic
level, but just on this

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
emplaced organic matter that
sits on top of your genes.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems so crazy,
but it's science.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And what it points
to so beautifully

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:90%
is that we can change this.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't really think
about my genes too much.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's complex.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:90%
But I can think about thinking.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I can affect
a positive energy.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I can change my
definition of myself.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I can look at my identity
as an energy being,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and look at this energy flow in
this body, and see it moving,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.551 align:middle line:84%
see my body healthy, hold those
positive thoughts about body.

00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That affects that organic matter
emplacement on your genes,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and your genes start
to do their job better.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And that may be a
window into healing.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a different thing.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not going in
and doing surgery.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not putting medication in.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
It's saying that I
have an absolute effect

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:90%
on the function of my body.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I am perfect health.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
I am perfect health.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in that DNA is the
image of that perfect body.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
They just came just this
last week, actually,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
a scientific
journal just came up

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
with some amazing information
that seems so insane.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But it points to the arrogance
we've had about our science.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
They said all the
junk DNA-- junk DNA?

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of stuff
they couldn't explain

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
in the DNA strings, all
these big, long strings

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:90%
in genes and DNA.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Like 97%.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they said it
doesn't do anything.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've always thought, since
a kid, the arrogance that we can

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
think that something
in this perfect nature

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have an effect.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying
some plant doesn't

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
have a medicinal
quality, it's a weed.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Then you find the
lapaʻau, Hawaiian

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
medicinal herb experts pick up
that weed and say, do you know?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:84%
If you boil this and
then use it as a compost,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
it will heal your broken
bone faster than anything.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And you go, I thought
that was a weed.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So same thing in science.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
These junk strings of
genetic information

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be switching
mechanisms that

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.800 align:middle line:90%
switch proteins on and off.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
direct function,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
but they influence
how a cell looks.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So every cell in your body has
the same bit of information.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But why does one cell look like
a liver cell and another one

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:90%
looks like hemoglobin?

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Why does one look
like a bone cell,

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:90%
one looks like a lung cell?

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that junk DNA, that
useless field of energy

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
has been holding the
perfect picture of your body

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and knows when a
cell needs to be

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
made into a liver
cell, when it needs

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
to be made into a lung cell.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
This is science,
and it's beautiful.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And it says that I can influence
that process with the thoughts

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.150 align:middle line:90%
that I carry.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So if I start taking
a more positive view--

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's just
positive or negative.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It's more about learning
to hold that picture.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
That picture exists inside
every cell in our body.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So if the perfect image isn't
just some new age thought,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's fact, it's the
science of every cell,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's why it's even
come out in our thinking.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we're carrying
it in our body,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.890 align:middle line:90%
and we just haven't listened.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
thoughts that we carry?

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting old.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
My back hurts.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I got a headache.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I have a blah.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And all the game that
we play is creating

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
the picture that epigenetically
blocks those genes

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:90%
from doing their job.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.964 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a body
that's getting old.

00:18:40.964 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:90%
And we have a headache.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And our back ache persists.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And all the chronic
problems continue

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
because we have, consciously
or unconsciously,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:90%
propagated that reality.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We are reality generators in
a beautiful, dynamic dream.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how much
more we need convincing,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.747 align:middle line:84%
but we live in a
great time of science

00:18:58.747 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:90%
where we keep getting it.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:90%
So we're lucky.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so through practices
like visualization too,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and Qigong, we what?

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it like a muscle
that we strengthen?

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Are we talking
neuroplasticity here?

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:10%
What are we talking about that
actually makes it so that then

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:10%
effortlessly, we
become those "I am

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:10%
perfect health" human beings?

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about breaking the
patterns, these insane patterns

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that have been set in our system
from government, and church,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and family, and
all your education,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:84%
has placed you in a world that
you are a victim of that world.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And none of those people would
ever say, we would never--

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:90%
it's not a victim mentality.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, break it down.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It's taking the
empowerment away from us.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's no judgment.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just simply saying, it's
time to take back our power.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It's time to say
that I can think

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:90%
about my body in a healthy way.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I can visualize qi flow or
energy flow through my body.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
I can do little
things incrementally

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to set up a new pattern.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think we can
ever stop an old pattern,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's smoking,
or drinking, or thinking

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.660 align:middle line:84%
about yourself as a
human getting older

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:90%
and moving into entropy.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:90%
You can't change those.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But you can set
up a new pattern.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And with these new empowered
patterns that we set up,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
slowly, the old
ones are displaced.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think the best
thing we can do

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is take on a practice like
yoga, or Qigong, or something,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're really
using the mind part

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how it influences

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:90%
your body in such a deep way.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And that we rewire the brain
with every new thought.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
sustain that thought

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and sustain that habit, that's
the plasticity of the brain,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
is that those ganglion set
up actual hardwired pathways.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And they become real, and
easier, and easier, and easier.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So for anybody who's having
trouble in their life

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and really feeling
the challenge,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I say, read a little bit
about this brain stuff

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:90%
if you want some confidence.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Or otherwise, just trust
that if you stay on it,

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and you stay with it,
and you stay confident,

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and you really come
from your heart,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that engagement
of heart and mind

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.490 align:middle line:84%
become this new
rewired mechanism that

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:90%
will make it easier and easier.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start to see
the changes in your body.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it so many times.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:10%
People who are challenged
with so many different disease

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:10%
states or chronic issues,
they cry sometimes,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:10%
because they say,
all I've been doing

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:10%
is this Qigong over
and over again.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And I really have
stayed diligent with it.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.875 align:middle line:90%
And this is the results.

00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
But it also depends on
the level of consciousness

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
at which you practice also.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
No matter what we do, no
matter how you are in life,

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
or even when you do Qigong, I
guess there's different levels

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in which then you really
integrate, or go deeper,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.255 align:middle line:90%
or absorb more the flow.

00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
we have to stay on it.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I always call Qigong
a sensitivity training

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
because as you practice it,
you get more and more subtly

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
engaged in your
body's functioning,

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world's
function around you.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:84%
The sensitivity,
you can see a person

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:90%
and feel them a little more.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to not
react so much to a person

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.600 align:middle line:84%
because your sensitivity
got to a point

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to say, wow, they're just
going through something,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and what they said
to me isn't about me.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So now all of a sudden, these
micro adjustments in your life.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, so it does take practice.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.605 align:middle line:84%
And to undo those old
patterns, destructive patterns,

00:22:31.605 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
it takes undoing
the inner chatter

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:90%
that we have about our bodies.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.997 align:middle line:84%
Because somebody might be
a real positive person,

00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
but you get to talk
to them for a while,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:84%
you find out they may
have a little bit of stuff

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that they say about
their body that is

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:90%
propagating that chronic issue.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, you go deeper.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And this work is
about going deeper.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a time right
now where we're supported

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
by amazing energy
astrologically,

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening
with these alignments

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:90%
of our Earth body right now.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You feel it?

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's science that's
showing what's happening

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:90%
on a deep level inside of us.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's for
everybody to really find out

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
how these influences affect
us, and then go with it,

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.115 align:middle line:90%
and trust, and have the courage.

00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:19.591 align:middle line:84%
Because courage comes
from heart, right?

00:23:19.591 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Coeur.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.571 align:middle line:84%
How do you say in
French, "heart"?

00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Coeur.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Coeur, that's the
heart-- courage.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be able
to have that courage

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.380 align:middle line:84%
to be able to face those things
that are challenging and say,

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I am dreaming this dream.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And that I can
influence this dream.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
I do influence this dream.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of practice about
seeing your body as energy,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
seeing the world as
energy, moving through it,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
adjusting that resonance that
we hold our body to sing at.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
What's the music
you want to carry?

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.635 align:middle line:84%
What is that tone that
you want to carry?

00:23:49.635 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
That's going to influence
the world around you.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the practices
or way of being every day,

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:90%
daily, that we could take on?

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I think the easiest thing
is just conscious breathing.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So if the three aspects
of Qigong are breathing,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
movement, and the yi,
or the mental stuff,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
than just a few minutes
of conscious breathing.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Because our breath changes
with our attitudes.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we get angry, our
breath gets short and deep.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
If we get fearful, our
breath goes like this.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:84%
If we're happy, our
breathing slows down.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We see how our breath is
affected by the outside world.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So in Qigong, I like to get
people to think about how

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to affect the breath
from inside-out

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than a
reactionary breath.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So do some slow, conscious
breathing, really deep,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
abdominal breaths,
squeezing the belly, really

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.770 align:middle line:90%
getting a full breath out.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And then use that breath as a
symbol of this kind of image

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that I am receiving
from the infinite.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Every inhale is opening myself
up to this infinite receiving.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And every exhale is a letting
go of what doesn't serve me.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, something
as simple as your breath

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
becomes the most
intense spiritual lesson

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:90%
you could have of the day.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So I think breath is
a great way to start.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And if people can
just slow down,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:90%
take five minutes to breathe.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a really busy
life, and you get in your car,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and you found yourself
rushing in the car,

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
putting your key in the
ignition, stop in that moment.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Turn the engine off, take
one minute to slow down

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and breathe before you drive.

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Little pattern breakers.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:90%
I think this is key.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And in nature, what is
your relationship to nature?

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I'm naked most
of the time in this beautiful.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
To me, rejuvenating
in nature is key.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:36.862 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to redefine
our relationship with nature.

00:25:36.862 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
In that breath, part
of that breath lesson

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.265 align:middle line:84%
could be the inhaling
of this beautiful oxygen

00:25:43.265 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
that we take in, and
remembering that oxygen comes

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
from all these trees
around us, and remembering

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that that oxygen is the
exhale of those trees.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And that my exhale, my waste,
what no longer serves me

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
in the exhale, is
the food, the carbon

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:90%
dioxide, that the trees need.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So there is another
spiritual lesson right there.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
That what is junk for
him is food for me.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden now, you
should be able to put yourself

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in this place of this
engagement of breath that says,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:90%
there's no good or bad.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.365 align:middle line:84%
What I release out
may feed somebody,

00:26:21.365 --> 00:26:23.730 align:middle line:84%
so I need to
continue to release.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no judgment
around that release.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:84%
What doesn't serve me
may actually be feeding

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and helping somebody else.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So we want to keep
that releasing going,

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and take in as much
as we can, and open up

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.500 align:middle line:84%
into this infinite
sense of self.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think breath is one
of the greatest ways.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I just love it
because sometimes,

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you feel guilty
for doing something

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.760 align:middle line:90%
or even for releasing.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt it, like releasing
the negative thoughts,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.980 align:middle line:84%
you're like, where
are those going?

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, what
am I doing with it?

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:90%
But I love the recycling part.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It's so freeing.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the matter
is it's only negative for you.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I hear people all
the time saying, oh,

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.220 align:middle line:90%
that person was so negative.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And the world is so negative.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this negative vibe.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
You're the one who's
creating that negativity.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a really hard
one for people to get.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's really unpleasant
because the ego really

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:84%
likes to have the definition
around the judgments of who

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
knows what's good
and bad in my life.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
matter is whatever

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
negative energy field
you're in can just

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
simply be a resource for you.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I go into situations with
sick people all the time,

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that person with
pneumonia as an adversary

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.580 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
They're not creating
something negative for me.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I hold the space of clarity
where I can go in there

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and not get sick.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it with lots
of people, not just me.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:90%
It's what you define.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It's back to that identity.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the key of
this energy work,

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
is redefining who you
are in this dream.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
If I am a field of energy, and
there's no good or bad, then

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
if I go into a
negative situation,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I can go in with that
absolute martial clarity

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and not be affected by it.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So what's the game
that you're playing?

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
What's the drama that
you're propagating

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.800 align:middle line:84%
in your negative world
around negative people

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
or negative relationships?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's all about energy.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all about going back
in and taking responsibility

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and say, what kind of
world do I want to dream?

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:28.910 align:middle line:84%
What do I want
this to look like?

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Why am I propagating this
victimization mentality?

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's me and
my body relationship,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or me and somebody
else, or me and money,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.710 align:middle line:84%
or me and health--
whatever it happens to be,

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:90%
it's all the same.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about that--
I guess it's not even

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.180 align:middle line:84%
a transmutation, but being with
that seemingly negative energy,

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:84%
or in those conversation
or situation,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and is that something that you
learned through martial arts

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:90%
or even Qigong?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.190 align:middle line:90%
How do you flip that?

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you turn that around?

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:90%
How do you enter that?

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
My first real master
was in Hawaii, actually,

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:90%
when I was 18 years old.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And he plucked me
out of university.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had a full
scholarship to be a doctor.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
weren't very happy

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:90%
when I left medical training.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
But he was a doctor himself,
an 81-year-old wizard.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing work.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:84%
That was the first
place where I really

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.740 align:middle line:84%
got what I knew intuitively
laid out in a structure

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
about understanding that
this is really a dream,

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and that everything is energy.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:90%
His word was "translate."

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
He was from England and
a real interesting guy.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And he would translate
what you held

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
as the language about your
reality in that moment

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and translate it into
its essential place.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very interesting
kind of energy work.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Takes you to a
place of when you're

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:00.150 align:middle line:84%
in a situation of scarcity,
or anger, or loss,

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
or grief, whatever
it happens to be,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.920 align:middle line:84%
how to translate that
into its essential place.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So over these 40 years, I've
been studying Chinese medicine

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how the TCM
or Traditional Chinese Medicine

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
mentality was
always about getting

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
your emotions, the
five core emotions,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and learning how
to control them.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:84%
How to take your anger
and control that anger.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your liver function
is out of balance,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:84%
so we want to bring it back
into balance so your anger

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.430 align:middle line:90%
comes into balance.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, taking with that old
master I studied with 40 years

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
go, learning
through that system,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:84%
more and more, I find
myself now sharing

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
that it's about
taking that anger

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and not controlling the
anger, but transforming it,

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
like you said, transmuting
it, converting that sleeping

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
state into a waking state.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Take the anger and
understand that at the core

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.920 align:middle line:90%
is a powerful energy.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And that if I work
with that energy,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I can take what the
expression of anger is

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into a waking
state of discernment.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And each of the
five emotions, I can

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:84%
see what their sleeping state is
and what their waking state is.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think part of
this identity shift,

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
understanding
ourselves as energy,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:84%
is to understand how to
stay awake in this dream.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:84%
How to see the things that you
do from a sleeping state where

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
they express themselves as
anger, or grief, or fear,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
or some base level, animal
sleeping state, and say,

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I have the opportunity
to shift that,

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
to transmute that up into a
higher state, a waking state.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Because really, it's
a sleeping state.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.689 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we feel sometimes,
so alive when we're angry.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:90%
We're like rawr!

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it's addictive.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us are just really
addicted to this stress,

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:90%
and this fear, and this anger.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
And because we feel alive.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You come back and you
tell your partner,

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.225 align:middle line:84%
you tell your
friend or something,

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I just got
angry at that person,

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and I told them what for.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Rawr, rawr, rawr.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:90%
You win.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:90%
The ego wins.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.030 align:middle line:90%
The ego is the sleeping state.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:90%
The ego is that duality state.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the state of scarcity.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the state of keeping those
emotions in that sleeping state

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.215 align:middle line:90%
so we feel like we're alive.

00:32:14.215 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're not alive,
and we're not awake.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the magic that happens
when you stop that anger

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.390 align:middle line:84%
reaction, or the fear
reaction, whatever

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
it happens to be for
your game, your dreaming,

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and you make that flip,
something incredible happens.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.810 align:middle line:84%
When you don't play that game,
when you stop it for a moment,

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
instead of getting
angry at a person

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.794 align:middle line:84%
and seeing somebody
for who they are-- I've

00:32:37.794 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
seen it many times--
that person might

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.160 align:middle line:90%
just break down and hug you.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
whole battle that's been

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.550 align:middle line:90%
going on for months is over.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people do
it at a distance.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with my mom
on a particular situation

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that I won't go into
completely here.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But it was an incredible story
that when she shifted inside,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and she went back to work
that following Monday,

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:90%
there was flowers on her desk.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And the person that
she was in battle mode

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:84%
for for months and
months, all of a sudden,

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:84%
wrote a little note to say
how much she loved her.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was no communication
between the Friday workday

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:90%
insanity and the Monday.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But my mom did that
shift inside her.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And she's not a person to
believe this sort of thing.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that was, for her, a real
turning point of understanding

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.060 align:middle line:84%
the power of our
thoughts, and the power

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:90%
of working with energy and qi.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Because when you see it
happen on a personal level,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
you realize, wow, it has
nothing to do with me explaining

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:90%
to that other person.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with me
shifting something physical

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.970 align:middle line:90%
because it's all energy.

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I can
take responsibility

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:44.470 align:middle line:84%
for and shift this field, who
knows what's going to happen?

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we shift,
our relationships

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
change as well because there's
this womb-to-womb relationship.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.971 align:middle line:84%
Have you come across that, or
explain it, or work on that?

00:33:53.971 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't describe it
necessarily that way,

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.460 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's a
beautiful model too.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I go back to science
because of my nature,

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and I see how atoms
are all tied together.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:84%
I see these experiments
where you can link one atom

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and magnetically spin it,
and then have another atom

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.580 align:middle line:90%
next to it and spin it.

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And then move those atoms
into two lead boxes,

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.880 align:middle line:84%
move those lead boxes
to different rooms.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And now change the
magnetic spin on this one,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.312 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
to the other one?

00:34:25.312 --> 00:34:26.620 align:middle line:90%
It changes its spin.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's no physical
way it happens,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and it happens faster
than the speed of light.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So we see replicable
scientific experiments

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:90%
that show us how tied we are.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you and I
get into a rhythm,

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:90%
we become intricately linked.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Something happens.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.275 align:middle line:84%
-Quantum entanglement.
-Yeah.

00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.590 align:middle line:90%
So we have to remember that.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the case, then any
issue you have with somebody,

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.855 align:middle line:84%
you have an absolute
responsibility

00:34:54.855 --> 00:34:59.722 align:middle line:84%
to shift it inside yourself to
help them change their spin.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So as we transform
ourselves, the world

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:84%
changes, our relationship
changes, or the people

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.660 align:middle line:90%
transform, shift.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The work is here.
-It has to.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And so take it into a practical
level, I think, is what I love.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
How do you take it into a
real, meat and potatoes,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:90%
everyday experience?

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
really becomes the work.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:84%
If it just stays in your little
spiritual Qigong practice,

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.829 align:middle line:84%
if it just stays in your
little altar at home,

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:26.995 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
back into the world

00:35:26.995 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're complaining
all the time,

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you're
really doing your work.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
The work is when you could
put it into action every day.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.856 align:middle line:84%
And then that becomes
the miracle of this life.

00:35:39.856 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even pushing
this from the inside-out,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
it's just this
beingness is way bigger.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:90%
The out is already inside.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:90%
So why waste time?

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Why think that
that's outside there?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:90%
It already exists in here.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Mapped inside my energy field
is the whole of the universe.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.866 align:middle line:90%
Has to be.

00:36:01.866 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Has to be.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So I have to take
absolute responsibility

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
not in the manifestation
of what happens out there,

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:84%
but in the influence I
have in this dreaming.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.490 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.980 align:middle line:84%
People go around and say, I
created this, I created that.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.660 align:middle line:84%
How could I have
created that mountain?

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But maybe what I did influence
is the dreaming of engaging

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
me into being here right now.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.380 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So take it more in a
gentle place, I think,

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:90%
is much more practical.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then watch how your
influences unfold and ripple

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:84%
out, and how you change
the vibe of this resonance,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and it opens up other people
to resonate in a similar way.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.316 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:36:41.316 --> 00:36:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
this amazing conversation.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I wondered if there is something
else that is on your mind

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.820 align:middle line:84%
or in your heart that you
would love to share here.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Just maybe listening to
what Makaleha's message is,

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and just really know
that sitting behind us

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is this amazing, blessed
mountain being, creature.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And that this idea of
wandering aimlessly

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.070 align:middle line:84%
may be a good
thing for all of us

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:84%
to remember to do
once in a while.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.270 align:middle line:84%
That we're so
focused on some path

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of getting some thing done, and
moving towards some end result,

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and just remember that
wisdom that we all know

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:90%
that it's about the journey.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's about wandering
aimlessly and trusting

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.690 align:middle line:84%
in that intelligence
that's inside

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.910 align:middle line:84%
of us, that's inside
that field that we're

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:90%
in in the world around us.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And trust that intelligence
that will guide us.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We're exactly on the
path we need to be.

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And she's got our back.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.960 align:middle line:90%
We're not alone at all.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Francesco.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.320 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
this conversation.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.341 align:middle line:84%
Every time, you have this
just magnificent presence

00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom.
Thank you.

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.486 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
sharing today, Lilou.

00:37:49.486 --> 00:37:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Much love, my
delicious co-creators.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
watching this video.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I send you much love from
beautiful, magical Hawaii

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.410 align:middle line:90%
with Makaleha.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Makaleha.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Makaleha.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Makaleha.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Aloha.
