00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.913 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.316 align:middle line:84%
I'm in England in London, in
the United Kingdom with Derek.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.084 align:middle line:90%
Hello Derek!

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:17.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Derek Mills: Hi Lilou.

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.553 align:middle line:90%
Great to have you here.

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:21.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Last time we saw
each other was in Windsor

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.456 align:middle line:90%
and now we're in London.

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Derek Mills: Yes, indeed.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.093 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Another parts of the
world, you know, same energy.

00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:27.961 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And I love
so much your energy.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.931 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring
another show about you

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.267 align:middle line:84%
or at least your teachings
and what you have to share

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.636 align:middle line:84%
on the Gaiam TV because
I'm doing this show called

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.038 align:middle line:90%
"Lilou on the Road".

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.908 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm traveling, I'm having
all those amazing conversation

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.946 align:middle line:84%
and I'm especially inspired by
who you are for many reasons.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.682 align:middle line:84%
For those of you that
have not seen this video,

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:84%
there's really-- we go into
details about your own story.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.224 align:middle line:84%
But basically, you wrote
"The 10-Second Philosophy",

00:00:57.224 --> 00:01:00.794 align:middle line:84%
which is your story after
a big kind of awakening.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.998 align:middle line:84%
And you live in the city here
in London and you're surrounded

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
by business people
and you coach people

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.169 align:middle line:84%
and there is a big
money conversation

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.704 align:middle line:90%
to have here I think.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.408 align:middle line:84%
'Cause there is some
misconceptions and so,

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.911 align:middle line:84%
this is a very useful topic
for all of you that are kind

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.049 align:middle line:84%
of not understanding the--
you know, I'm spiritual.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing everything right
and yet there's this thing

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.519 align:middle line:90%
about money that is not working.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.922 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
in this situation, no?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Derek Mills: Absolutely.

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the challenges
that I have faced myself

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:90%
of those is around money.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.965 align:middle line:84%
That was the first three
quarters of my adult life.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.001 align:middle line:84%
And it was then when I was
have to change my perception

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:46.072 align:middle line:84%
around money and who I am and
the space held for other people.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.642 align:middle line:84%
The thing around money began to
shift for me and it shifted as,

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:90%
you know, an enormous way.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.212 align:middle line:90%
But that's started on the inside

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.181 align:middle line:84%
and that's I think why it's
worth taking the journey

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.682 align:middle line:90%
down that path today.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: OK.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to get in
there because I'm ready.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:02.222 align:middle line:90%
We're all ready to hear this.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:84%
Can you summarize what
happen and what were--

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:09.328 align:middle line:84%
were you were at money
and how you see money now?

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:13.133 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: You know part of
my stories that's at least

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.069 align:middle line:84%
about eight or nine years
ago, I was totally broke.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.239 align:middle line:84%
I was not working, having
worked for d18 years on--

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: How old are you?

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: I'm 48 now.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:25.112 align:middle line:84%
And so for the first--
well, as an adult,

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:27.781 align:middle line:84%
so I was 38 years
old, 38 in a bit.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.817 align:middle line:84%
I was really just working
on a commission only

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.687 align:middle line:84%
or self-employed only
running my own business.

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:37.858 align:middle line:90%
And at age 38, I'm broke.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm depressed.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.061 align:middle line:90%
Not depressed 'cause I'm broke.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.729 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I'm happened
to be depressed.

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.432 align:middle line:84%
But never diagnosed and
refused to go to the doctors.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
But I just-- I knew where I was.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
What happened for me at that
point was I got to an evening

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.041 align:middle line:84%
in my life where I recognize
that I wasn't going to go

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.079 align:middle line:84%
on any further as the old--
what I call the non-self.

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.148 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the non-self
and the philosophy.

00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.951 align:middle line:84%
And the non-self is how
the world constructs makes

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.219 align:middle line:90%
us behave.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:84%
And this non-self isn't
who we really are.

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The true self is the essence
of what we came here as

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.058 align:middle line:90%
and who we really are.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:15.595 align:middle line:84%
So the non-self isn't able
to access our true gifts

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle line:84%
and our true abilities, and how
genius and through the conduits

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.668 align:middle line:84%
through everything
else that's around us.

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.038 align:middle line:84%
When we reconnect with our
true self, the truth is

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.474 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually bring
that gift and that genius

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to the benefit of the world
for our [inaudible] journey.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle line:84%
We can also use it
in our businesses.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle line:84%
'Cause one of things that
struck me is I get meeting

00:03:36.383 --> 00:03:39.786 align:middle line:84%
around the world now and I
still do meet some wonderfully

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:84%
amazingly spiritual,
enlightened, gorgeous people

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.894 align:middle line:84%
who then after spending some
time without telling me, well,

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:49.996 align:middle line:84%
financially, they're
not doing very well.

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:53.166 align:middle line:84%
And I'll-- well,
how would that be

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:56.202 align:middle line:84%
because these are amazing
enlightened people.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.604 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well,
business is tough

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.372 align:middle line:90%
and this isn't going very well."

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:03.343 align:middle line:84%
And it began to challenge me
so I have to go back inside

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:08.248 align:middle line:84%
to my own genius, to my own gift
and say, so what does that mean?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.984 align:middle line:84%
What I've began to cover the
people did have essentially

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.987 align:middle line:84%
when they were enlightened
and awareness being part

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:17.056 align:middle line:84%
of the oneness and being
part of everything else.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.058 align:middle line:84%
But if you're part
of the oneness,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:19.960 align:middle line:90%
some of the questions might be,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.162 align:middle line:84%
isn't the oneness
in all of your life?

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:23.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.531 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: If you're part
of the oneness, it's--

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:26.032 align:middle line:84%
isn't it part of intelligence
energy, part of God,

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.401 align:middle line:84%
part of the souls
whatever people believe,

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
light energy, everything
being one.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.973 align:middle line:84%
Why would that stop
nine to five?

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:35.742 align:middle line:84%
Why would that suddenly
stopping your business?

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.545 align:middle line:84%
Why would you be a wonderful,
amazing, creative genius

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:90%
in one part of your life?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.215 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in all of your
life apart from that nine

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.950 align:middle line:90%
to five, what was missing?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.252 align:middle line:90%
And once you got something

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that was missing 'cause you
weren't allowing yourself

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.757 align:middle line:84%
to bring your true
oneness into that space

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.392 align:middle line:84%
where you're essentially
blocking yourself.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.395 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And also, I began to
explore what are the kind

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.031 align:middle line:84%
of things that I did
when I literally woke

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.233 align:middle line:90%
up those few short years ago.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.769 align:middle line:84%
And why did I bring in
to my business and bring

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
in to my life, not just be a
coach, and a mentor, and a guide

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.477 align:middle line:84%
or a counselor for the
people, but actually to be OK

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.245 align:middle line:90%
around making money out of that.

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:84%
Because it's your
thoughts about that I had.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.183 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking very recently
to a mind, body, spirit event

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.552 align:middle line:84%
and there're some beautiful
people, some coaches

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.354 align:middle line:90%
and mentors in the room.

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.591 align:middle line:84%
And having had a couple of
conversations beforehand,

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:28.228 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted [inaudible]
business wise and financially

00:05:28.228 --> 00:05:30.764 align:middle line:84%
and not great, not
doing that great.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:33.133 align:middle line:84%
But they were great people
and they had great energy,

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.435 align:middle line:84%
and great spirit
but not doing great.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.137 align:middle line:84%
And one young lady
in particular,

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:40.173 align:middle line:84%
I recognized had a challenge
around money with she wants

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.176 align:middle line:84%
to change the world, tell
everyone to be the light

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.711 align:middle line:90%
and energy, and love and caring

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.247 align:middle line:84%
and trust me she is
all of those things.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:50.583 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't really appreciate
that there was a part of her

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.986 align:middle line:84%
that was-- that she
was blocking.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:54.354 align:middle line:90%
It was around money.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.222 align:middle line:84%
It was around-- she felt she
had to give, give, give, give,

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:58.958 align:middle line:84%
give love and light and caring
and sharing, but didn't want

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.228 align:middle line:84%
to receive for herself, and
was refusing to receiving it.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:05.398 align:middle line:84%
When we make judgments about
what we're allowed to receive,

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:08.201 align:middle line:84%
that causes challenges
and causes blocks.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.837 align:middle line:84%
So I said-- so I wasn't
particularly [inaudible]

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:13.873 align:middle line:84%
talking, I just said,
you know, 2000 years ago,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.543 align:middle line:84%
regardless of your faith is--
for example, 2000 years ago,

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:19.579 align:middle line:84%
you know, Jesus walks
around on the earth.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:90%
Some people, son of God,

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to other people,
no, a great prophet.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.019 align:middle line:84%
By the way, most people
accept that walked

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:27.987 align:middle line:84%
around a couple thousand
years go on the planet.

00:06:27.987 --> 00:06:31.291 align:middle line:84%
And I was told when I was
at school that Jesus was--

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.694 align:middle line:84%
his trade was he was a
carpenter until he was 30.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I was also told that
Mary, his mother,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.135 align:middle line:84%
his Mary's earthly husband,
Joseph, was also a carpenter.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.271 align:middle line:84%
And I got to thinking that it
didn't actually say anywhere

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.575 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible that they were--

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.909 align:middle line:84%
they were [inaudible]
the charity.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.713 align:middle line:84%
What actually said was-- said
that they were carpenters

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:54.881 align:middle line:90%
and I began to understand

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.449 align:middle line:84%
that they were professional
carpenters, right?

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.119 align:middle line:90%
They did that for a living.

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:01.321 align:middle line:84%
Did they actually make the
chairs and tables and cupboards

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:03.523 align:middle line:84%
and wonderful furniture
and did they stand it all

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:07.127 align:middle line:84%
and give it all away for
nothing, being absolute martyrs

00:07:07.127 --> 00:07:09.963 align:middle line:84%
in their service or did they
say, actually it's OK for us

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:12.766 align:middle line:84%
to create and spend our time
doing this and to use our gifts

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:90%
for the benefit of others.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.669 align:middle line:84%
It's actually OK to
receive something back.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.738 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, it doesn't
say anywhere in the Bible,

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.407 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mention in the
Bible, I kind of believe

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.509 align:middle line:84%
that they are professional
carpenters,

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.145 align:middle line:84%
which means they allowed
themselves to receive money

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:26.913 align:middle line:84%
for that which they
gave to the world.

00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:30.183 align:middle line:84%
They may have traded, I don't
know, a chair for a goat.

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.452 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but they allowed
that transaction to happen.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.154 align:middle line:90%
And clearly, no way does it say

00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.189 align:middle line:84%
that they were uncomfortable
with that.

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:40.994 align:middle line:84%
So my belief is around actually
good enough for Jesus to receive

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:42.462 align:middle line:90%
for that which he gave.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Good enough for you,
good enough for me,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.131 align:middle line:90%
good enough for all of us.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.133 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
saying I accept this,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that I can give value in to the
world and I can get value back.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.308 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that came to me
was around, if we're all part

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
of the oneness and we
are enlightened beings

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.847 align:middle line:84%
in our relationships and in
our health and with our friends

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:84%
and the family and
we want to help

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.184 align:middle line:84%
and change the world
helping the people,

00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:08.421 align:middle line:84%
what part of that oneness would
certainly stop when you got

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.223 align:middle line:84%
to the office at
nine in the morning?

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.258 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why would that be?

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.594 align:middle line:84%
Why would it stop
between nine to five, so,

00:08:14.594 --> 00:08:16.729 align:middle line:84%
I began to meet more people who
said, "Well, this provide you

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:19.532 align:middle line:84%
for living Derek and it's just
not going very well at all."

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.534 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "Well, OK,
so how is that working?

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:24.337 align:middle line:90%
Well, these are my goals.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.372 align:middle line:84%
And you know, part
of what I talk

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:28.942 align:middle line:90%
about is the goals that work.

00:08:28.942 --> 00:08:31.444 align:middle line:84%
If they work, then the world
will be a different place

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:32.778 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:36.516 align:middle line:84%
Goals really cause a disconnect
between who we really are,

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:90%
our true self and the oneness.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.656 align:middle line:84%
So, when I talk about stop
setting goals, and the--

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.757 align:middle line:90%
what it really say's is,

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
stop living your life
outside of yourself.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.795 align:middle line:84%
Stop putting your happiness
and your contentment

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.564 align:middle line:84%
into the future, and instead
bring that into your now

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.466 align:middle line:84%
about being present
and living in the now.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.069 align:middle line:84%
And here's why, because
we only have now.

00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.606 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: 'Cause when we attach
us ourselves to goals,

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:01.174 align:middle line:90%
we really ask-- what we attach

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
to the goals is actually
contentment and happiness.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.112 align:middle line:84%
You've been all around
the world, yup.

00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to people
of diverse, beliefs,

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.184 align:middle line:84%
and backgrounds, cultures,
colors, and creeds.

00:09:11.184 --> 00:09:14.988 align:middle line:84%
And, have you ever met
the person that said,

00:09:14.988 --> 00:09:17.457 align:middle line:84%
"I've set the goal
to be unhappy."

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:18.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: No.

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:19.125 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: No.

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.026 align:middle line:84%
Didn't think so,
and this is you.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.694 align:middle line:90%
And they've been everywhere.

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:23.129 align:middle line:84%
Well, neither have I
and I've traveled less

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.531 align:middle line:90%
but neither have I.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.268 align:middle line:84%
So, what I accept therefore when
people set goals, they set goals

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:32.138 align:middle line:84%
to be happy or happier
or more content.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.573 align:middle line:90%
So, that being said--

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Or richer.

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.075 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Or richer,
yeah, all those things.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:39.946 align:middle line:84%
And that richness gives them
happiness, often of contentment,

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:43.883 align:middle line:84%
or worthiness or self-esteem,
whatever, feelings of one end

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.251 align:middle line:90%
or the other happiness.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's the challenge because
the problem with the goal,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.289 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if it's next
week, next month, next year,

00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.824 align:middle line:84%
or three years, five years,
10 years, it's future based.

00:09:51.824 --> 00:09:54.627 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, what we tend
to do is attach our happiness

00:09:54.627 --> 00:09:56.729 align:middle line:84%
or the contentment
to the achievements

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:59.232 align:middle line:84%
of that future goal, and that's
where the happiness stays

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:00.733 align:middle line:90%
which means you're not present.

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.735 align:middle line:84%
The very act of setting
the goal, disconnects you

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:04.237 align:middle line:84%
from who you are
now from your truth,

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:06.105 align:middle line:90%
from your true self today.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.641 align:middle line:84%
So, you're on this
very, very long journey

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.944 align:middle line:84%
and you can skip seeing your
happiness into the future.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:14.981 align:middle line:84%
But that's an illusion because
happiness is a now experience.

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:16.015 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is not a thing--

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.483 align:middle line:84%
well, you can't be
happy in the future.

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:20.019 align:middle line:84%
We can only be happy now
because this is what we have.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.789 align:middle line:84%
So, when I begun to share
people about first begin to look

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
at the goals that
you're setting,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.326 align:middle line:84%
is it about setting
goals that bring you away

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:29.362 align:middle line:84%
from your own oneness bring
you away from your true self.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.097 align:middle line:90%
Is that a wise thing to do?

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:33.032 align:middle line:84%
And the question I mean,
sometimes tongue-in-cheek.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:35.368 align:middle line:84%
But I sometimes ask, well how
is it working out for you?

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:37.437 align:middle line:84%
You know, how many years
you've been setting goals for?

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.839 align:middle line:90%
Well, 10 or 30, you know.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle line:84%
So, after 10, 20,
30 years, well,

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.544 align:middle line:90%
how is that working out for you?

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:46.479 align:middle line:84%
How is it working out
for your community?

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.313 align:middle line:90%
For your business?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.781 align:middle line:90%
For the world?

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.751 align:middle line:84%
We've all been doing this
for a hundred or more years.

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.186 align:middle line:90%
But how is that working out?

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:55.788 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin to be really
honest with ourselves and say,

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:59.225 align:middle line:84%
maybe that our true self
doesn't get into the game.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:01.794 align:middle line:84%
Because setting our future
goals with this illusion

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:04.397 align:middle line:84%
about happiness in the
future pulls us out,

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.933 align:middle line:84%
cause that disconnect
and we cannot be present.

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.168 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't bring your
best game into your business,

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.504 align:middle line:84%
if you're not present in your
business, if your present

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.773 align:middle line:84%
in word but not in deed,
in energy, in spirit,

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:15.808 align:middle line:84%
'cause the best of you is
out there in some future,

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.977 align:middle line:84%
how are you going to
help your clients?

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.113 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
change the world really?

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:84%
So, people begun to
recognize the struggle

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:25.318 align:middle line:90%
with bringing their A game,

00:11:25.318 --> 00:11:27.387 align:middle line:84%
their true self into
their business.

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:30.256 align:middle line:84%
And so what we had to then do
was to discover there are ways

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.125 align:middle line:84%
of bringing your true self
into the business and that's

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.527 align:middle line:84%
by stop setting goals
'cause you people think

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.662 align:middle line:84%
if you have a business,
you must set goals.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, to have a business,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.999 align:middle line:84%
it means about what you
decide to give as a service.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.035 align:middle line:84%
What's the passion
[inaudible] inside of you

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.238 align:middle line:84%
and what are you going
to give as a service.

00:11:45.238 --> 00:11:47.907 align:middle line:84%
That brings us back to
we can keep ourselves--

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.742 align:middle line:84%
what can we do to
keep ourselves true

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.779 align:middle line:84%
in our self center
today, balance today?

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:56.582 align:middle line:84%
And if we can find that place
and travel with that place

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:59.652 align:middle line:84%
and energy inside of us and
bring it into the nine to five,

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:84%
we can change the whole of
our responses in the world.

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.624 align:middle line:90%
So, that was the first thing.

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:06.926 align:middle line:84%
What was the second thing,
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:07.627 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Second.

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:08.728 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Second thing now.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing that
came to me was that,

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.232 align:middle line:84%
you know when you
got this-- so I was--

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:16.369 align:middle line:84%
I've been busy now building
business for 27 years.

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:19.639 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with being busy
for those 27 years is 18 years

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.074 align:middle line:84%
that were awful that
was really worse

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.542 align:middle line:84%
and I was struggling
in business.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:25.078 align:middle line:84%
And-- man, this is
going to get my--

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.013 align:middle line:84%
so, as I'm struggling
in business,

00:12:27.013 --> 00:12:30.983 align:middle line:84%
what's actually happening
is that I'm trying

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:32.618 align:middle line:90%
to do the very best I can.

00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:36.856 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving everything I
can to customers, clients,

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:39.726 align:middle line:84%
potential customers,
potential clients.

00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
And as I do that,
they're winning.

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:46.666 align:middle line:84%
They're getting benefits
but I'm losing.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:48.067 align:middle line:90%
Over the time, I began to share

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:52.305 align:middle line:84%
and to experience myself was I
had to do what I call the A, B,

00:12:52.305 --> 00:12:56.209 align:middle line:84%
C, and C. Now, the A, B, C, and
C is just a really simple way

00:12:56.209 --> 00:12:59.278 align:middle line:84%
of saying, how'd you bring
your oneness into your business

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:02.048 align:middle line:84%
and whether it really
accelerates you potential

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:06.552 align:middle line:84%
to create wealth, to have more
money being your life 'cause you

00:13:06.552 --> 00:13:08.721 align:middle line:84%
can sit there attracting
but what are you going to do

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
to practically in your business
in the next meeting that you're

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.725 align:middle line:84%
in to make sure that
more money comes to you

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.628 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I call the A,
B, C, and C. And the A, B, C,

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.464 align:middle line:84%
and C is actually really
straightforward because it's

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
about bringing your
authentic self

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.102 align:middle line:84%
into that business
every single day.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:25.538 align:middle line:84%
So, going back for one
moment for the goals,

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.141 align:middle line:84%
if we detach ourselves
and put part of our self

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
into the future, it's difficult
to be our authentic self

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.345 align:middle line:84%
in the present with
people that we sit

00:13:32.345 --> 00:13:33.546 align:middle line:90%
down we're hoping to serve.

00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:36.048 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not being really
authentic in that place.

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:39.986 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the one that
people have first to recognize

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:44.389 align:middle line:84%
that they must be fully present
with those they wish to serve.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:47.593 align:middle line:84%
The second part was around--
or the B is around the balance.

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.796 align:middle line:84%
Because what was
instinct for me was that--

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:53.966 align:middle line:84%
especially I'm coaching people
who are in business as coaches

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.102 align:middle line:90%
and teachers and speakers.

00:13:56.102 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And I would just say,
wow, this is interesting

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.573 align:middle line:84%
because I think I love what you
do and I would say, you know,

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.876 align:middle line:84%
and I love what you do and
you should be making a fortune

00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:05.178 align:middle line:90%
because you're giving a fortune

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:06.813 align:middle line:84%
to the world through
what you do.

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:08.247 align:middle line:90%
So what's happening?

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:11.083 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered
where I came from.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:15.054 align:middle line:84%
Because the B in the A, B,
C, and C is not balance.

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.791 align:middle line:84%
See at one end, if we are
martyrs, if we give everything

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.727 align:middle line:84%
and give and give and give
and give in service and time

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:24.964 align:middle line:84%
and energy to people,
eventually, we dissipate

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:26.299 align:middle line:90%
that which we have, the gifts

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.569 align:middle line:84%
that we have become
reduced and reduced.

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:34.106 align:middle line:84%
And we can really help the
world, but it's about balance.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
The other end of that
scale of balance is greed.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.979 align:middle line:84%
And if you're greedy, and
you think about just you,

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.815 align:middle line:84%
what you can get, the money you
can make, then awfully that--

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:44.784 align:middle line:84%
you may seem to win in the
short term, but we all know

00:14:44.784 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that generates into you losing
the long term spiritually

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.055 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're greedy, you're
thinking about yourself

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.959 align:middle line:84%
and what you can get
and what you can charge

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.961 align:middle line:84%
and how much money you can
make, but you know what?

00:14:54.961 --> 00:14:58.231 align:middle line:84%
When you're greedy, the world
suffers, those around you

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.799 align:middle line:90%
and the world, they suffer.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.034 align:middle line:90%
But if we're martyrs, we suffer.

00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:03.569 align:middle line:90%
So, here's where we have to be.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.737 align:middle line:84%
We have to be here
in the middle.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.708 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to be a carpenter
and the son of God

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:11.878 align:middle line:84%
or a great prophet or a
wise person or a spiritual

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:15.982 align:middle line:84%
or a teacher, coach, mentor,
and to not be a martyr

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to the world and
to not be greedy.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.719 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to have that
balance in the middle,

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:23.522 align:middle line:84%
to accept that which is OK
for you to have accepted.

00:15:23.522 --> 00:15:25.925 align:middle line:84%
And when will that balance
placed, we [inaudible]

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.828 align:middle line:84%
from being a martyr, and
people, potential customers

00:15:28.828 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:84%
and clients pick up on
that energy and they go,

00:15:31.063 --> 00:15:32.531 align:middle line:90%
"I can't mess with this person.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.833 align:middle line:90%
I can't make them a martyr.

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:36.736 align:middle line:84%
I was a martyr for 18 years
in my business driving all

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:39.205 align:middle line:84%
over the UK for scraps of
business serving people

00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:41.007 align:middle line:90%
who woke up when they wanted."

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:43.409 align:middle line:84%
I was suffering in pain and
working six days a week,

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.544 align:middle line:84%
not until late into
the night as you know.

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:50.082 align:middle line:84%
And I was the martyr, that's
not why I came here to be.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.851 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't come
here to be a martyr

00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:53.152 align:middle line:90%
to dissipate my energy.

00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
It's fair for me to give
my service and my love

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.122 align:middle line:90%
and my light to others.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.823 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's OK for
me to have reward for myself

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:59.258 align:middle line:90%
so that for me was OK.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.726 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a martyr
and I'm not greedy.

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But then we have to look at
what's called the C in the A, B,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.367 align:middle line:84%
C and C. The C of this us that,
it's really interesting how

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:12.672 align:middle line:84%
when we're in business,
that if you hear about,

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:16.142 align:middle line:84%
you talk about energy and people
have heard you into before.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:20.346 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that you meet
people who are most energetic

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:90%
and enlightened and fun people.

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:24.717 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes when we're
in business

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:28.454 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't got the rapport
with those with whom we wish

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:34.327 align:middle line:84%
to serve, our high energy-- if
we're bouncing off the ceilings,

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.396 align:middle line:84%
that high energy can put off
our opportunity to serve.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.832 align:middle line:90%
People just go, yeah.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.669 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, but not for me,
well, thank you very much.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.671 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to recognize
where they are.

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:46.305 align:middle line:90%
It's not about us.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:47.707 align:middle line:90%
It's about them.

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:50.343 align:middle line:84%
And it's also about saying if
our energy isn't high enough,

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.546 align:middle line:84%
where enthusiasm isn't high
enough, we can also not--

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:56.115 align:middle line:84%
we have some absolute
gems of wisdom

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.817 align:middle line:84%
and really have the
ability to serve people,

00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:01.253 align:middle line:90%
have genius stuff inside of us.

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.588 align:middle line:84%
But if our energy
isn't high enough,

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.090 align:middle line:84%
or our [inaudible]
isn't high enough,

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.893 align:middle line:84%
we also do not get the
ability or the right to serve.

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.896 align:middle line:84%
So, when we look at the bouncing
off the walls and their energy,

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.566 align:middle line:84%
we have to come back to the
center 'cause at the center

00:17:13.566 --> 00:17:15.501 align:middle line:84%
of all of us, you're
looking at balance

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:17.570 align:middle line:90%
or looking at our energy.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.638 align:middle line:84%
We have to be balanced
and centered because back

00:17:19.638 --> 00:17:22.475 align:middle line:84%
to being the core, back to
being the true self 'cause

00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:90%
at the core, there's oneness.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.946 align:middle line:84%
At the core, there is the
oneness 'cause we're all part

00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:28.014 align:middle line:90%
of the oneness.

00:17:28.014 --> 00:17:30.149 align:middle line:84%
But also at the core
is our own oneness.

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.584 align:middle line:90%
It's the part of the universe.

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:35.688 align:middle line:84%
The part of the universe was
actually that came through me,

00:17:35.688 --> 00:17:38.524 align:middle line:84%
that came through you, that
come through each of us.

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the light energy
that later you said,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.728 align:middle line:90%
the part of the universe is you.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:45.231 align:middle line:84%
But here's your personality
on it.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.332 align:middle line:90%
It's called your life.

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:48.334 align:middle line:90%
A part of the universe is me.

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.069 align:middle line:90%
It is my personality on it.

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:90%
It's called my life.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.174 align:middle line:84%
So, it's being at our core
that helps us to be authentic,

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:56.409 align:middle line:90%
balanced and centered.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:59.512 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when the
magic happens 'cause me of--

00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:01.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Just finding
that space.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:03.315 align:middle line:84%
It's all about finding that
space and then the rest

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.184 align:middle line:90%
of the stuff, no goals, nothing.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:07.186 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: It's about finding
that space because remember,

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.421 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about there,

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.923 align:middle line:84%
how do we be a wonderful
spiritual enlightened selves

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.692 align:middle line:90%
and do OK be prosperous.

00:18:12.692 --> 00:18:13.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Abundant.

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:14.894 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Abundant in the world.

00:18:14.894 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
Great work, and how we-- part
of what we do here is we say

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:18.898 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves, it's OK.

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
So, let's be authentic,
balanced, centered,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.738 align:middle line:84%
and the magic that happens is we
get the connection with people

00:18:25.738 --> 00:18:28.674 align:middle line:84%
in a way that they
just go, you know what,

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I've seen other people in this
business, or coach or teachers

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.978 align:middle line:84%
or advisors, whatever,
or consultants,

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.814 align:middle line:90%
but they suddenly start saying,

00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:37.349 align:middle line:84%
this is the person
'cause everyone of us

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:40.753 align:middle line:84%
as you know is just looking
for in our lives somewhere

00:18:40.753 --> 00:18:43.789 align:middle line:84%
to plug back into, somewhere
that we recognize or resonate

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.658 align:middle line:84%
where we feel that
this is right.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:49.095 align:middle line:84%
And for most people in the
world who not may be enlightened

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:53.265 align:middle line:84%
or as spiritual as they might
be, they're still in that place

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
on the inside, that
oneness is still there.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.368 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't disappeared.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:00.039 align:middle line:84%
So, we-- it allows us to save
those people, I'm authentic,

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.574 align:middle line:90%
balanced, and centered.

00:19:01.574 --> 00:19:03.809 align:middle line:84%
And through that, they find
their connection with us.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.445 align:middle line:90%
So, in real business terms,

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.114 align:middle line:84%
if we want to accelerate
our business results

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:09.815 align:middle line:90%
and get abundance in our life,

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.785 align:middle line:84%
we have to become
abundantly authentic,

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:15.988 align:middle line:84%
abundantly balanced,
abundantly centered.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.058 align:middle line:84%
And then the connection with
others will blow you away

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:21.827 align:middle line:84%
when you do the A, B, C, and
C 'cause people that begin say

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.396 align:middle line:84%
to you, I will do
business with you.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.398 align:middle line:84%
You're the person
I want in my life.

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:29.101 align:middle line:84%
You're the person, your
chances are higher.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:32.004 align:middle line:84%
You live further away than
people who I've talked

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.739 align:middle line:90%
to you, but you're the one.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.375 align:middle line:84%
'Cause what they've
recognized is the authentic,

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.676 align:middle line:90%
balanced, centered self.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.979 align:middle line:84%
It's an unspoken language,
but it's there nonetheless,

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:42.448 align:middle line:84%
and then having got to be
enlightened to recognize that.

00:19:42.448 --> 00:19:46.819 align:middle line:84%
They cannot be enlightened
but still know that truth.

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:84%
In my business, from the
moment I woke up and began

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.224 align:middle line:84%
to be authentic,
balanced, centered linked on

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:56.228 align:middle line:84%
and connected, my business
results went through the roof,

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and part of my story is
that I went from being broke

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.398 align:middle line:90%
to being a millionaire

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.735 align:middle line:84%
within three years doing the
same business in the same office

00:20:02.735 --> 00:20:05.771 align:middle line:84%
with the same "service
and products".

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:09.341 align:middle line:84%
So, what happened is people
kept turning up in big numbers

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:12.444 align:middle line:84%
and I'm referring other people
to me saying, those are the guy.

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:14.547 align:middle line:84%
By the way, he's
the cleverest guy.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.515 align:middle line:90%
He's not the most academic guy.

00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
He hasn't got the
most experience

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.785 align:middle line:84%
in the business,
but he's the guy.

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.253 align:middle line:84%
You got to go meet
with this guy.

00:20:21.253 --> 00:20:22.555 align:middle line:84%
I meet these people
and they would refer me

00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.423 align:middle line:84%
to other wealthy
people and others,

00:20:24.423 --> 00:20:26.358 align:middle line:84%
the kind of clients
were approaching me

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.694 align:middle line:84%
that I would have dreamed of
having, wouldn't have, you know,

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.196 align:middle line:90%
given a small finger for.

00:20:30.196 --> 00:20:32.231 align:middle line:84%
You know, or at least
a small bit

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:34.066 align:middle line:90%
of the thing anyway years ago.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:38.737 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: But I became prosperous
by holding that space for others

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:42.675 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to see what
was there for them and for me

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
in that relationship and
this is what happened.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, it was not
the economy that was wrong.

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:48.314 align:middle line:90%
It was not the office.

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:50.382 align:middle line:84%
It was not the colleagues
or the clients,

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:52.418 align:middle line:84%
the skills were there
already though.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:55.254 align:middle line:84%
It was just you that
were not showing up.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.455 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Oh course,
yeah, because--

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:59.291 align:middle line:84%
that's a great question
because the economy before

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.194 align:middle line:84%
and after are the same products
and services about the same

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:04.296 align:middle line:84%
of the office, the
same office, OK,

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.298 align:middle line:84%
well it's not doing very well,
I share it with other people

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.168 align:middle line:84%
through the people so I've
even shared the office

00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:13.806 align:middle line:84%
when I then did better,
the office was just mine.

00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:17.009 align:middle line:84%
So, but the thing-- the key
thing about this is that, see,

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.511 align:middle line:84%
the prosperity is
already out there.

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.414 align:middle line:84%
See, it's floating
around as a leaf right now

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:26.151 align:middle line:84%
and prosperity comes through us
through our ability to open up

00:21:26.151 --> 00:21:27.386 align:middle line:84%
and allow other people
to open up

00:21:27.386 --> 00:21:29.622 align:middle line:84%
and connect-- to
connect with us.

00:21:29.622 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Skills or no skills?

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.424 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Well, what has--

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:34.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There's also people
looking for the business too.

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.228 align:middle line:90%
You have to know what you do--

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.163 align:middle line:84%
doing because you can't just
stay I'm authentic, balanced,

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:40.566 align:middle line:84%
center, connected, and I'm
going to be, I don't know,

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:44.003 align:middle line:84%
the best paid brain surgeon or
wealth manager, whatever it is.

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:45.137 align:middle line:90%
You have to know your stuff.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.306 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the-- you
know, the physical stuff

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:90%
and the real stuff of the world.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.376 align:middle line:90%
But the reality of it is--

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You have
to love what you do.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.212 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Of course, it
has to be your passion.

00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:84%
So, what can-- what quite
come through here is

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:58.751 align:middle line:84%
after you discover and we'd be
ourselves, the biggest thing

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.654 align:middle line:84%
around money is that
forget about the money.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:03.422 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: It's not about the money.

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.924 align:middle line:84%
It never has been
about the money.

00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:07.059 align:middle line:84%
It's around other
people are looking

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.861 align:middle line:84%
for authentic people
to deal with.

00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:10.562 align:middle line:84%
And here's why you
get the business.

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:11.964 align:middle line:84%
Here's why you expand
your business.

00:22:11.964 --> 00:22:13.732 align:middle line:84%
Here's why you create prosperity
for yourself and your finally

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:16.101 align:middle line:84%
and those that you love, is
because other people are looking

00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:18.871 align:middle line:84%
for some way to plug in,
that being around the world--

00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:21.073 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to other
counselors, teachers, advisors,

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:23.242 align:middle line:84%
and one of the businesses
sales people here in--

00:22:23.242 --> 00:22:24.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Healers.

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:26.745 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Healers, whatever,
and they go, "You know what,

00:22:26.745 --> 00:22:28.847 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find the
right place for me."

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:32.484 align:middle line:84%
So, when we hold this space
for them, they come and we say,

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:37.256 align:middle line:84%
this is a customized service
and that's OK, and they begin

00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:38.791 align:middle line:90%
to turn up in huge numbers.

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:84%
And when they turn up,
they become customers

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:43.662 align:middle line:84%
and clients 'cause they're
thinking I wasn't feeling

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:44.697 align:middle line:90%
this before.

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:45.764 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't getting this before.

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:47.266 align:middle line:90%
What are they getting?

00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:49.101 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the fee
that you're charging.

00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:50.269 align:middle line:90%
It's not even about the product.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:51.937 align:middle line:84%
It's about the space
that you create for them.

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So, when I sit down with-- I
tell you what, one of the things

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.241 align:middle line:84%
that I've written
about in the book.

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:58.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, no agenda really
when you're meeting a client,

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:00.512 align:middle line:90%
I mean no preparation.

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:01.914 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: None.

00:23:01.914 --> 00:23:02.982 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to-- you
have to have your intention--

00:23:02.982 --> 00:23:04.116 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:23:04.116 --> 00:23:04.883 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: -- about why am
in this building for,

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.585 align:middle line:90%
that's important to know.

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:10.155 align:middle line:84%
You're not there to pick
up lint off the floor.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.725 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's-- it is about
saying, I know what I'm here

00:23:12.725 --> 00:23:16.328 align:middle line:84%
to do, but if I'm in business,
those are what they have to do,

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:19.164 align:middle line:84%
but most businesses fail
or don't succeed is no--

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.833 align:middle line:90%
they're not wealth created.

00:23:20.833 --> 00:23:23.602 align:middle line:84%
So, it is about saying to
ourselves to hold that space

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:24.636 align:middle line:90%
and people will begin to turn.

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:27.139 align:middle line:84%
It's about what can
you be for others?

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:29.408 align:middle line:84%
So, it's almost detaching
from the outcome

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.843 align:middle line:90%
of what might happen there.

00:23:30.843 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Help them.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, I mentioned
that in my book

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:37.649 align:middle line:84%
about I have an awful lot in my
client side advise, particularly

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
on the financial side that I
advise who are accountants,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.523 align:middle line:84%
former accountants, FDs
or financial directors

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle line:84%
and retired financial
directors, people who you want

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.161 align:middle line:84%
to think are very logical,
very left brained, very--

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:51.196 align:middle line:84%
you know, very worldly,
and things that can weigh

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:52.664 align:middle line:90%
such measure and [inaudible].

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:57.136 align:middle line:84%
And that's the world they came
from and lived in for maybe 40,

00:23:57.136 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
50, or 60, or 70, or 80 years.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.006 align:middle line:90%
And they come to meet me,

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:05.878 align:middle line:84%
and I ask the question,
"Why are you here?"

00:24:05.878 --> 00:24:07.646 align:middle line:90%
'Cause what's led you here?

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:08.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: They don't know.

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: They don't know 'cause
that service that I give,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.819 align:middle line:84%
you know, the products,
the laws, the tax laws,

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:15.354 align:middle line:84%
the investment advisor,
if it's counseling

00:24:15.354 --> 00:24:17.356 align:middle line:84%
about personal development
or self-help

00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:19.291 align:middle line:84%
or revealing their
genius to themselves,

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.859 align:middle line:90%
they can get that anywhere.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:22.961 align:middle line:84%
So, I kind of think
you were supposed

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.229 align:middle line:90%
to know why you're here.

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:26.899 align:middle line:90%
And what I tend to find is

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.234 align:middle line:84%
that they [inaudible]
left-brained people.

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:31.136 align:middle line:90%
I opened a space for them.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:34.106 align:middle line:84%
And they just find that
space, and they go, "Wow!

00:24:34.106 --> 00:24:36.008 align:middle line:90%
I'm 72 years old."

00:24:36.008 --> 00:24:37.109 align:middle line:90%
They're not telling me this,

00:24:37.109 --> 00:24:38.343 align:middle line:84%
but I just know that's
what they're feeling

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:40.345 align:middle line:84%
but it's future conversations
in the first meeting

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:43.015 align:middle line:84%
where they're saying,
this is different.

00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:46.018 align:middle line:84%
The other people we've met they
talk about the returns, the this

00:24:46.018 --> 00:24:47.586 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom line
and the whatever.

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.788 align:middle line:84%
This guy is just saying,
actually we're talking

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:51.824 align:middle line:90%
about that part of the end.

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:55.194 align:middle line:84%
First, you want to explore
here is about you and beginning

00:24:55.194 --> 00:24:57.996 align:middle line:84%
to know you, not just your
values but your beliefs,

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:00.332 align:middle line:84%
your identity and what you're
all about, and the space,

00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:03.602 align:middle line:84%
whether the space we hold is OK,
'cause it's OK for us not to be

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:04.603 align:middle line:90%
in our lives together.

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:06.405 align:middle line:84%
And so, and if that's
not the case,

00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:08.373 align:middle line:90%
I can [inaudible] somebody else.

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:10.843 align:middle line:84%
And that's letting them know
right upfront that it's OK

00:25:10.843 --> 00:25:12.778 align:middle line:84%
if this doesn't work out
for us because, you know,

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:14.546 align:middle line:90%
it may not be for now.

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:16.849 align:middle line:84%
And they usually start
feeling something different

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
that they haven't felt before.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.854 align:middle line:84%
Here's where they were and
we are operating from here,

00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:23.622 align:middle line:84%
from the mind, from
the conscious sort

00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:90%
or they be from the ego.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:27.826 align:middle line:84%
We can often take in a way
off track after the true self.

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.595 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe move away
from the minds

00:25:29.595 --> 00:25:32.431 align:middle line:84%
and into the unconscious
spiritual beings that we are

00:25:32.431 --> 00:25:36.401 align:middle line:84%
and accepting that even for in
front of an accountant who is

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:41.507 align:middle line:84%
in 60 years of business, they
too have a spirit, have a soul,

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
have energy from the
source, a part of God,

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.377 align:middle line:90%
part of [inaudible] even

00:25:45.377 --> 00:25:47.579 align:middle line:84%
if you have no idea
what those words mean,

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.982 align:middle line:84%
they're still part
of the oneness.

00:25:49.982 --> 00:25:51.049 align:middle line:90%
So we--

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You've looked
through their soul

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:53.285 align:middle line:90%
so you're read-- that's how we--

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, that's how we do
it, and the reason why we do it

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.956 align:middle line:90%
because that's who we are.

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.292 align:middle line:84%
See, this isn't you
and this isn't me.

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.593 align:middle line:90%
It's what's inside of that.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:05.197 align:middle line:84%
This is the vessel that
carriers around our truth.

00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:07.399 align:middle line:84%
When we reveal our truth,
somebody else but I was saying,

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.835 align:middle line:84%
OK, no matter how I
sound in this meeting,

00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:12.704 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reveal my truth to
this person and hold the space

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:14.673 align:middle line:84%
to help them to reveal
their truth to me.

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.942 align:middle line:84%
And if we can meet
in that place,

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:19.411 align:middle line:84%
we both feel settled
and honored.

00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:20.512 align:middle line:90%
We get to do business.

00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
That's-- We happened
to do business.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.316 align:middle line:84%
That just like-- that
one's like a byproduct

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.285 align:middle line:84%
but we found this
connection, which is why

00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:29.288 align:middle line:84%
when I have clients
working with me,

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:31.523 align:middle line:84%
they often give the
same kind of feedback.

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:33.825 align:middle line:84%
And these people who are
not into their mind, bodies,

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:36.028 align:middle line:84%
spirit [inaudible] end
up saying things like,

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:39.331 align:middle line:84%
I felt this real connection
or haven't felt this way

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.732 align:middle line:84%
or I thought you're
really authentic

00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:90%
and we haven't felt this.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.136 align:middle line:84%
They begin to use the language
'cause it must be there.

00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:46.038 align:middle line:84%
It's not that knowledge,
that wisdom,

00:26:46.038 --> 00:26:48.774 align:middle line:84%
in a sagacity is already there
within them and they begin

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:51.843 align:middle line:84%
to reveal that as you
hold the space for them.

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:53.545 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about
you, it's about them.

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:54.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:55.247 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah.

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:56.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: No wonder
that-- no wonder you're--

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:59.017 align:middle line:84%
you've got such a vision
here in London, in the city

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:02.621 align:middle line:84%
and with all the bankers and
the traders and the money here

00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.156 align:middle line:90%
that circulates in London.

00:27:04.156 --> 00:27:09.361 align:middle line:84%
No wonder you're being chosen
to do this work, I love it.

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:12.831 align:middle line:84%
How shift-- it must shift
people totally and started--

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:14.132 align:middle line:90%
then they shift other people.

00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:15.434 align:middle line:90%
I mean again, it's beautiful.

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:18.403 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, it is about
shifting others because,

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:22.307 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the world today
it's not recognizing what we

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:26.511 align:middle line:84%
really are and this is
obvious to you and for all

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
of you listeners and viewers.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.084 align:middle line:84%
But it's obvious what we
really are, but it's obvious

00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to the most of the world
what we really are,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.189 align:middle line:90%
that we are spirit and oneness.

00:27:37.189 --> 00:27:39.691 align:middle line:84%
So let's act as if
it's not obvious.

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's be true and say,
"It's not obvious."

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.932 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm here, in my language,
in my communication with others,

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:49.334 align:middle line:84%
and let's say that
they are somewhere else

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.737 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even here and
their understanding.

00:27:51.737 --> 00:27:54.072 align:middle line:84%
If I keep speaking
here, I'm not going

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.975 align:middle line:84%
to engage those people
so here's a thing.

00:27:56.975 --> 00:28:00.912 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back to
if you don't mind, Jesus.

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:03.649 align:middle line:84%
2000 years ago, Jesus
walked on the earth.

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:07.452 align:middle line:84%
From my belief system,
son of God,

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:10.422 align:middle line:84%
real acknowledged wisdom
part of the universe,

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:12.958 align:middle line:90%
so, part of the creation.

00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:15.594 align:middle line:90%
Now, if you're the son of God,

00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:19.631 align:middle line:84%
I began to wonder,
he knew everything.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:22.868 align:middle line:84%
You really are part of-- even
at the beginning, you know.

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.736 align:middle line:84%
You went brief afterwards
you were told how this--

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:27.105 align:middle line:84%
it's all about this
and you know,

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:29.374 align:middle line:84%
you come to the earth
knowing everything, you know,

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:32.277 align:middle line:84%
every concept, every
idea, every thought,

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:33.912 align:middle line:84%
every ability, every
bit of wisdom.

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
you do not know,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.516 align:middle line:90%
every language, every content.

00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:40.619 align:middle line:84%
So, you can communicate at
the highest level beyond man.

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.156 align:middle line:84%
But here's a question
that came to me.

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:49.361 align:middle line:84%
If Jesus was God, why
did he speak in parables?

00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:55.033 align:middle line:84%
'Cause he was here, but
he spoke and he said,

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:59.104 align:middle line:84%
"There was a sower
sowing some seeds."

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, "There was a
man who had two sons,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.178 align:middle line:84%
one wants his fortune and he
went away and the prodigal son."

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:11.416 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke in parables
in simple stories,

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.685 align:middle line:84%
why did he do that,
being son of God,

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
he could have just
given us, you know,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.190 align:middle line:84%
we listen to wise people all
the time, you interview them.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:23.929 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is me actually,
you know, it reminds me of when

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, he gave a
sermon, a sermon on the mount

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.502 align:middle line:90%
and he talked to multitude

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:34.139 align:middle line:84%
of people barely stating the
scripture that, you know,

00:29:34.139 --> 00:29:36.108 align:middle line:90%
3000 were converted that day.

00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:39.111 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone so he
gave his truth.

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
He spoke his truth and
he made some sales.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.648 align:middle line:90%
He made some conversions.

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:44.883 align:middle line:84%
Some people looking
for converted.

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.284 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.787 align:middle line:84%
So even when we do this,
we have to recognize

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:51.123 align:middle line:84%
and everyone wouldn't actually
be aware of our message

00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:53.492 align:middle line:84%
but the most important
message that came across to me

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:56.394 align:middle line:84%
and that thing that kept coming
through again and again is

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:59.831 align:middle line:84%
that he spoken parables 'cause
he recognize that where he was

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.933 align:middle line:84%
in his awareness of his
enlightenment, of everything

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.136 align:middle line:90%
of the oneness, people he wanted

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:07.239 align:middle line:84%
to help the most were
not in that place.

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:09.174 align:middle line:84%
So he had to come down
and shift his language

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:11.743 align:middle line:84%
and just speak in
simple parables.

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.546 align:middle line:84%
What that mean for us as
teachers and leaders and coaches

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:19.284 align:middle line:84%
and guides and counselors, it
means that it's not about us.

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.653 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about what we know.

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.021 align:middle line:84%
It's about knowing
our intention,

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.222 align:middle line:90%
but it's about the other person.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:26.158 align:middle line:90%
So, I have to shift my language.

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:84%
The only way for me to
move someone is to go

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:31.062 align:middle line:90%
where they are so they can--

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: To meet
them where they are.

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:33.832 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: To meet them where
they are and to engage them

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:35.767 align:middle line:84%
where they are and
then begin bit by bit

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:39.337 align:middle line:84%
to have them be more
enlightened and more awake.

00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:42.574 align:middle line:90%
But here's what we don't do.

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:84%
We don't communicate with them
in such a way where they go.

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:49.481 align:middle line:84%
He is very wise,
but I don't get it.

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.349 align:middle line:90%
There's no connection there.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.717 align:middle line:84%
They're not feeling
the authenticity.

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.853 align:middle line:84%
They're not feeling the light
and the love and the energy

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:56.188 align:middle line:90%
that you already carry.

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So trust yourself.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.726 align:middle line:84%
As where there were coaches or
teachers or mentors or parents

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:04.129 align:middle line:84%
or friends, it's about
trusting ourselves.

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:08.934 align:middle line:84%
And when I counsel
people without our recall,

00:31:08.934 --> 00:31:11.336 align:middle line:84%
real problems, you know,
problems in their life,

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:14.539 align:middle line:84%
with their relationship with
their family, their business,

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.941 align:middle line:84%
you know, circum--
they're humans

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:18.777 align:middle line:84%
and problems arise
when you're human.

00:31:18.777 --> 00:31:21.146 align:middle line:84%
When I counsel people and
mentor and coach people,

00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:23.782 align:middle line:84%
I now then take time to
listen to their journey

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:26.351 align:middle line:84%
and how they got there
and the problems and often

00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:29.921 align:middle line:84%
if you know more than just one
[inaudible] and I often begin

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to really just to feel where
they are, recognize the space

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.632 align:middle line:84%
that they're in and what begins
to come through me was your lack

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:45.237 align:middle line:84%
of trust in yourself has led
you here, the lack of trust

00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.807 align:middle line:84%
in yourself, because it appears
that you've trusted the company,

00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:51.676 align:middle line:84%
the employer, the industry,
the media, the newspapers,

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.578 align:middle line:90%
other teacher and other leaders.

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.947 align:middle line:84%
Here's what you have
not done to this point.

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:57.816 align:middle line:84%
You have not trusted
yourself and part

00:31:57.816 --> 00:32:00.118 align:middle line:84%
of the universe is
in you as in them.

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:02.354 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of the
world, the guiding light,

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:04.756 align:middle line:84%
the intelligent energy
that you came here as part

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:05.857 align:middle line:90%
of the universe, part

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.926 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
expression came through you.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:12.364 align:middle line:84%
This light was given to you so
you are the wisest of the wise.

00:32:12.364 --> 00:32:16.902 align:middle line:84%
You are a servant [inaudible]
but when you don't believe that,

00:32:16.902 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't appear in your life.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.572 align:middle line:84%
It's about reconnecting
with that truth,

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:90%
often saying accepting it, OK?

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.744 align:middle line:84%
So when I say your lack of trust
in yourself has led you here,

00:32:25.744 --> 00:32:28.179 align:middle line:84%
what I mean is that problems
[inaudible] that they have seems

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:31.483 align:middle line:84%
to be the biggest challenge that
we have is going on the inside

00:32:31.483 --> 00:32:33.318 align:middle line:84%
and trusting what's
already there for them.

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:90%
So who knows you're the best.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.389 align:middle line:84%
This is great when we're
working with, you know,

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:39.724 align:middle line:84%
anyone that we're
counseling in particular.

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.526 align:middle line:84%
Because often, when
things go wrong,

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:44.296 align:middle line:84%
we start not believing
in ourselves.

00:32:44.296 --> 00:32:47.866 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing about the
true self, if you believe just,

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:50.468 align:middle line:84%
you know, a small amount,
the grain of a mustard seed,

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:52.337 align:middle line:84%
just give a bit of-- have a
bit of belief in yourself.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:54.673 align:middle line:84%
Begin to trust yourself
just a small amount.

00:32:54.673 --> 00:32:56.274 align:middle line:84%
As if that your true
self wakes up and says,

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, you trust me now."

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.212 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just, well,
do I turn left or right.

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:04.916 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got real strong feeling
to go right so I'll go right

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:08.887 align:middle line:84%
and your true self gets
simulated and that later on,

00:33:08.887 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
you begin to trust the true
self on, you have this person

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.892 align:middle line:84%
as a client, but you don't
have them as a client.

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:15.226 align:middle line:84%
You have this person
in your life

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:16.428 align:middle line:84%
which you have to
have that person.

00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:19.664 align:middle line:84%
So as you begin to trust
yourself on first small

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:22.133 align:middle line:84%
and then bigger things,
the relationship

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:25.737 align:middle line:84%
with your oneness develops
'cause once we are part

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:28.673 align:middle line:84%
of the oneness, there
is oneness within each

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.575 align:middle line:90%
of us so we are oneness.

00:33:30.575 --> 00:33:33.044 align:middle line:84%
So when that true self
begins to recognize

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:36.548 align:middle line:84%
that we are paying attention to
it and that we're trusting it,

00:33:36.548 --> 00:33:38.950 align:middle line:84%
it just think it
is really amazing.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.787 align:middle line:84%
It begins to trust us, so
it begins to lead us more

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:46.257 align:middle line:84%
and to guide us more and to
share and reveal much more to us

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.927 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to have
an incredible life

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to appear geniuses and
gurus ourselves 'cause each

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.165 align:middle line:90%
and everyone of us is a genius.

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:56.401 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of us is a
guru 'cause that seems that--

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:57.369 align:middle line:90%
we know this to be true.

00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:58.770 align:middle line:84%
It's inside each
and everyone of us.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.272 align:middle line:84%
So when you don't appear
guru like in your own life,

00:34:01.272 --> 00:34:04.476 align:middle line:84%
it's about pausing and going
back inside and beginning

00:34:04.476 --> 00:34:07.946 align:middle line:84%
to trust yourself and follow
the messages and the guidance

00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:09.881 align:middle line:90%
that come from that place.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.149 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:15.754 align:middle line:84%
I am-- aren't we totally--
I get it, there is this--

00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:19.157 align:middle line:84%
this thing that's just
created by your words

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:20.925 align:middle line:90%
and your beingness [phonetic].

00:34:20.925 --> 00:34:23.795 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- that's
exactly what you're teaching

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:29.501 align:middle line:84%
but you're putting it right now
in place like we can feel it.

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:33.604 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for-- 'cause
that's the main thing,

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:36.441 align:middle line:90%
is that you're embodying it,

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:38.809 align:middle line:84%
so it's like not just
you're talking it

00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:84%
but you're embodying
it so we're getting it

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:42.479 align:middle line:90%
and that's how we get it.

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:47.318 align:middle line:84%
I am very, very grateful
for this conversation.

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:49.888 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: More of a
soliloquy, really wasn't it?

00:34:49.888 --> 00:34:50.854 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: The what?

00:34:50.854 --> 00:34:51.789 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: There's more
of a soliloquy.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:52.724 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What is
that in English?

00:34:52.724 --> 00:34:53.557 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, I don't
know that word.

00:34:53.557 --> 00:34:55.959 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:34:55.959 --> 00:34:57.095 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: A solo conversation.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:35:00.131 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But there is
so much and it's so--

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.934 align:middle line:84%
it's so, so beautiful,
and there is--

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.503 align:middle line:84%
of course there is a lot of
things that we could talk about

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:08.206 align:middle line:84%
and knowing exactly what our
purpose is and all of that,

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:11.810 align:middle line:84%
but it comes always back to
them, to just beingness anyway,

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:13.144 align:middle line:90%
whether we know it or not.

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.379 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Yeah, and of course

00:35:14.379 --> 00:35:16.781 align:middle line:84%
because we are spiritual
beings, I think we get this.

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:18.983 align:middle line:84%
If you watch these conversation
and you probably get that,

00:35:18.983 --> 00:35:22.353 align:middle line:84%
but here's the thing, you
know, this being that we are,

00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:23.521 align:middle line:84%
this part of the
universe, this energy,

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:26.157 align:middle line:90%
this spirit chose to be here.

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:30.995 align:middle line:84%
So, when we have this amazing
god-like quality of being part

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:34.199 align:middle line:84%
of the source, being part of
God, and part of the energy,

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:37.235 align:middle line:84%
what is it about us that
often blocks ourselves

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:40.071 align:middle line:90%
to the prosperity available

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:43.274 align:middle line:84%
in this physical world
'cause we chose to be--

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:47.312 align:middle line:90%
no, I existed before I was born.

00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be existing after
I've shuffled off this mortal.

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You're eternal.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:52.984 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Absolutely,
'cause we're all eternal.

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.319 align:middle line:90%
We're all eternal.

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:57.856 align:middle line:84%
So, we chose to be here, so
we didn't choose to be here

00:35:57.856 --> 00:36:01.392 align:middle line:84%
in a way where we would
just experience a great

00:36:01.392 --> 00:36:02.627 align:middle line:90%
spiritual journey.

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:05.597 align:middle line:84%
We are allowed 'cause we
chose to be here and we want

00:36:05.597 --> 00:36:09.033 align:middle line:84%
to our spirit to experience
the physical and the prosperity

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:11.736 align:middle line:84%
and the joy and the care and
the adventures and the thrills,

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.271 align:middle line:90%
one thing I love about Lilou is

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that no matter how many times
I see you interviewing people,

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.242 align:middle line:90%
you're still energetic.

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:18.576 align:middle line:90%
You're still excited.

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.812 align:middle line:84%
You're still enjoying the
journey and you love what you do

00:36:20.812 --> 00:36:23.515 align:middle line:84%
and that's the experience
of life.

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:24.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What's interesting is

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's exactly what you're
describing is that I am relaxing

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.889 align:middle line:90%
into somebody else's world.

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.924 align:middle line:90%
So and then the magic happens.

00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:34.526 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause
you hold a great space in people

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:35.527 align:middle line:90%
and therefore, it opens up.

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:37.162 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it's around--

00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:39.364 align:middle line:84%
you know, sometimes it's
around accepting of self,

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
not from an ego point of view,
but accepting yourself saying,

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.068 align:middle line:90%
who am I, who am I really.

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:47.138 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's OK for me to be
'cause it's not about the money,

00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.373 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned money
really early on.

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:51.943 align:middle line:84%
But it's more about the gift
that we have is oneness,

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:54.546 align:middle line:90%
this genius that we all have.

00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:57.182 align:middle line:84%
Let that flow into
all of our lives.

00:36:57.182 --> 00:37:00.218 align:middle line:84%
Don't let it stop nine to
five and this wonderful person

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:02.420 align:middle line:84%
so which-- it's almost
have to say, you know,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:06.491 align:middle line:84%
almost have this story that I
tell about the person that wakes

00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:08.259 align:middle line:84%
up in the morning and
they're very spiritual,

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:09.627 align:middle line:84%
they're very holy, and
they're very blessed,

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:12.197 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
meditation, and are there

00:37:12.197 --> 00:37:13.698 align:middle line:90%
for an hour, and then meditate.

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:14.966 align:middle line:84%
And then they leave
the meditation

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:17.135 align:middle line:84%
and hold this wonderful
space they create some energy

00:37:17.135 --> 00:37:20.371 align:middle line:84%
around them, and they go to the
place they know that they exist.

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.207 align:middle line:84%
And then they go-- they'll
do some yoga in the morning

00:37:22.207 --> 00:37:25.543 align:middle line:84%
and the breathing is right and
they finish with some moments,

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's wonderful and
meeting medication at the end.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.317 align:middle line:84%
And then they get dressed
and they put that clothes

00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:35.286 align:middle line:84%
on the night, put the alarm
on and then close the door,

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.688 align:middle line:84%
and they leave there and
is jumping to the car

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:38.389 align:middle line:90%
and I begin to fight the world.

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.591 align:middle line:90%
They have challenges

00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.159 align:middle line:84%
that they're beeping their
home with other people.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:43.428 align:middle line:84%
They're going to their business
and that oneness that they found

00:37:43.428 --> 00:37:45.997 align:middle line:84%
in the meditation place is
not in the business meeting.

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.966 align:middle line:84%
It's not in the room where
the meeting in your class,

00:37:47.966 --> 00:37:49.734 align:middle line:84%
in your potential
class, it's not there.

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:52.937 align:middle line:84%
The space which is the core, the
truth, the being of each of us

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.038 align:middle line:90%
that they found

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:56.574 align:middle line:84%
in the meditation should
[inaudible] we carry

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:58.176 align:middle line:90%
through all of our day.

00:37:58.176 --> 00:38:00.178 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have that
place when you're on your own

00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:01.946 align:middle line:90%
in your room doing a meditation.

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:05.516 align:middle line:84%
Then it's where we need to be at
this place when we are working

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.352 align:middle line:84%
with other people, when
we walk down the road

00:38:07.352 --> 00:38:09.787 align:middle line:84%
and we see someone, and
we make an eye contact,

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're in our office,
whether talking to the cleaner,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.259 align:middle line:84%
or whether talking to a
millionaire, or whether talking

00:38:14.259 --> 00:38:17.295 align:middle line:84%
to a person who's serving us in
a shop, or whether we're trying

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:19.931 align:middle line:84%
to get a new bit of business
to a client, is that holding

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:22.867 align:middle line:84%
that space that says,
this is my call.

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:24.269 align:middle line:90%
This is my truth.

00:38:24.269 --> 00:38:27.739 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the world tries
to do to me, my objective just

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:31.909 align:middle line:84%
for today is to hold that
space, and that's how I get

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.344 align:middle line:90%
to serve the world the best.

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Holding that space and by the
way, the great thing about it is

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.982 align:middle line:84%
with the philosophy
that says don't try

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.151 align:middle line:90%
and hold this space forever.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.686 align:middle line:84%
Don't try and do
this for a week.

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.154 align:middle line:90%
Do not try and hold this space

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:45.123 align:middle line:84%
and hold your truth
the rest of your life.

00:38:45.123 --> 00:38:46.157 align:middle line:90%
Just hold it for today.

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: For now, yeah.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Just for now, until
you get your head back

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.061 align:middle line:90%
on your pillow tonight.

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.329 align:middle line:90%
That's the time to hold it,

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:55.533 align:middle line:84%
'cause tomorrow you can be
blessed with another day.

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.403 align:middle line:84%
There is also some nos
that I guess that you have

00:38:58.403 --> 00:39:00.772 align:middle line:84%
to say though because there
are so many opportunities,

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:90%
how do you deal with that?

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.876 align:middle line:84%
How do you deal with going
that way versus this way

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:06.477 align:middle line:84%
and saying yes to
these clients and not

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.846 align:middle line:84%
to these clients 'cause
I found out to for me

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:11.616 align:middle line:84%
with the interviews that there's
more nos than yeses and I have

00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:14.619 align:middle line:84%
to see a lot of nos even
though if there is no yeses.

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.288 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: A lot of times we find,
you know what, then that's why,

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:19.757 align:middle line:84%
you know, your truth
has led you here.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:23.328 align:middle line:84%
Your trust in yourself has
led you here because the life

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:25.029 align:middle line:84%
that you've created and
the light that you shared

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:27.999 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity you give
to others to share lights

00:39:27.999 --> 00:39:29.801 align:middle line:84%
to help others and
to guide one another

00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:33.371 align:middle line:84%
and to help one another is
because you trust yourself.

00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:36.507 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a knowingness
inside, and we all have this.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.843 align:middle line:84%
It's really a question of
now you can have light inside

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:39.877 align:middle line:90%
of you while you're choosing

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:43.348 align:middle line:84%
to trust the light
and to be led by it.

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:45.516 align:middle line:84%
And if you're led by your
light, yeah, you can say, well,

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.251 align:middle line:84%
my light is now saying
to me, go right.

00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:48.653 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
I'm saying to--

00:39:48.653 --> 00:39:49.587 align:middle line:90%
well, it's saying to go right,

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.122 align:middle line:84%
but that's where
we're going to do.

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.657 align:middle line:84%
Is this person going
to be a client or not

00:39:52.657 --> 00:39:55.693 align:middle line:84%
and you check inside and
double-check with your truth,

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:58.396 align:middle line:84%
almost out checking back and
doing a mini-meditation maybe

00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.432 align:middle line:84%
for around 10 seconds, just
take that time, not a long time,

00:40:01.432 --> 00:40:03.368 align:middle line:84%
but you can change your
life by holding yourself

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.337 align:middle line:84%
in this 10 second moments,
giving yourself time to go in.

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.206 align:middle line:84%
See what that means
to me, not hear.

00:40:08.206 --> 00:40:10.441 align:middle line:84%
See what it means for me,
see what it means for you

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.809 align:middle line:90%
as you travel your journey.

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:15.146 align:middle line:84%
And in those 10 seconds, follow
the instincts, the guidance,

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:17.715 align:middle line:84%
the intuition, the message,
the wisdom, the sagacity

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.051 align:middle line:90%
that comes from that place.

00:40:20.051 --> 00:40:22.887 align:middle line:90%
Take action from that place.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.757 align:middle line:84%
We all know the people who
have wonderful journeys

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:30.061 align:middle line:84%
on the inside, but when we know
that you know that you know

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:34.232 align:middle line:84%
who you are is when you
act that inside, outside.

00:40:34.232 --> 00:40:36.367 align:middle line:84%
So, when we have
wisdom from within us,

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.202 align:middle line:84%
it's true wisdom
and we act upon it.

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:40.972 align:middle line:84%
When we do the thing that comes
for us, we ask the question

00:40:40.972 --> 00:40:42.974 align:middle line:84%
that comes and we speak
the words that come.

00:40:42.974 --> 00:40:44.409 align:middle line:84%
When we go to the left
instead of right, when we call

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:46.811 align:middle line:84%
or we don't call, we
do or we don't do,

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.913 align:middle line:84%
it's because we're following
the wisdom from inside

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:51.516 align:middle line:84%
and that's how it caused
a revolution in our lives.

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:52.683 align:middle line:90%
That's how we change our lives.

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.185 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can
change the world 'cause

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:55.887 align:middle line:90%
that wisdom is from the truth.

00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:57.221 align:middle line:90%
It's from the source.

00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.591 align:middle line:84%
So when we allow it through
us, not just be inside of us

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:03.961 align:middle line:84%
and to hold that space, but to
actually have it be inside of us

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:06.664 align:middle line:84%
and hold that space yet
act and do something,

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.933 align:middle line:90%
physically act and do something.

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:13.337 align:middle line:84%
Without that, I will continue
to meet so many different people

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:18.443 align:middle line:84%
who are-- who do all
the work on the inside.

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:20.912 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
doing what you do,

00:41:20.912 --> 00:41:23.514 align:middle line:84%
which is I don't even
know why logically,

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:27.518 align:middle line:84%
but it's not this person
or yeah, it is this person

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:30.788 align:middle line:84%
and it's this day, I'm going
to tune in and trust myself,

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:34.826 align:middle line:84%
follow my instinct, my
intuition, follow my truth.

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:38.563 align:middle line:84%
That's what we need to be or
begin to do and it helps us all

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:40.798 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's really
fair because the experience

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:43.601 align:middle line:84%
that I went through that
when I made my shift

00:41:43.601 --> 00:41:47.738 align:middle line:84%
and when I woke up, I changed
straight away 'cause my life was

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.773 align:middle line:90%
so bad.

00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:49.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That was
radical, yeah.

00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:51.075 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Radical.

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:55.413 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was not diagnosed
but almost depressed, broke,

00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:57.248 align:middle line:84%
working six days a week and all
the rest not seeing my wife,

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.349 align:middle line:90%
not seeing my children,

00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.617 align:middle line:84%
all these things were
going-- were wrong.

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:00.751 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I was a failure

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:04.956 align:middle line:84%
on every single level
that mattered to me.

00:42:04.956 --> 00:42:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, so someone
said a strange thing to say,

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.962 align:middle line:90%
but all that was a grace for me.

00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:14.332 align:middle line:84%
It was a blessing because when
I had the first 10-second moment

00:42:14.332 --> 00:42:16.467 align:middle line:90%
that woke me up, I was willing

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:18.069 align:middle line:84%
to change everything
straight away.

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:20.838 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah, whatever comes
up, 'cause the first moment,

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:24.575 align:middle line:84%
my truth began to speak and my
true self revealed wisdom to me.

00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:26.711 align:middle line:84%
And the more that--
from that first moment

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:29.914 align:middle line:84%
from that first evening as it
began to reveal itself to me

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:32.617 align:middle line:84%
and from that day to all
this, whatever comes up,

00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:34.185 align:middle line:90%
I follow through on it.

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:36.587 align:middle line:84%
So, I have a bit of a blessing
here because all my troubles

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:37.989 align:middle line:90%
of 18 years of pain

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:40.258 align:middle line:84%
and struggling were actually a
blessing because it made me say,

00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:42.426 align:middle line:84%
"OK, whatever comes up,
I'm going to follow.

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:44.529 align:middle line:84%
I know what life is like
living the other way.

00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:45.897 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work for me.

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:84%
That causes pain and fractured
relationships and challenges

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.868 align:middle line:84%
and so whatever comes
up, I trusted it."

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:53.504 align:middle line:84%
But I respect the fact that
everyone is going to be

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
in the same place and that
everyone is just willing

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to do that, and just to
trust but it's a blessing,

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:04.181 align:middle line:84%
so anyone that's listing or
watching now that has problems,

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:08.019 align:middle line:84%
challenges, real problems
that tearing the very life

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:11.689 align:middle line:84%
out of you, there is a time when
we allow our self to go, "Well,

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:15.626 align:middle line:84%
that will be your blessing,
that will be your saving grace.

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:16.894 align:middle line:84%
Because it's that
that will allow you

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.197 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes
others who are doing OK

00:43:19.197 --> 00:43:21.332 align:middle line:90%
in life are not prepared to do."

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:23.167 align:middle line:90%
We've all know just that.

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:26.437 align:middle line:84%
So, what I began to understand
now if we're going to work

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.739 align:middle line:84%
and counsel with other
people, whereas first

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:32.009 align:middle line:84%
as understood how they were not
trusting themselves, I would--

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:36.213 align:middle line:84%
what they were really-- what
is it that we're not trusting.

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.916 align:middle line:84%
Lilou whatever not
trusting it was their truth.

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
It was unnatural if he's part of
the truth, part of the source.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.555 align:middle line:84%
They were not trusting
the source coming

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:45.923 align:middle line:90%
through them in their lives.

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Then how can
we follow our truth

00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:48.292 align:middle line:90%
when we don't love ourselves?

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>> DM: Well, we have--

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Or respect.

00:43:50.194 --> 00:43:51.429 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, it's not
[inaudible] say, well,

00:43:51.429 --> 00:43:53.164 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in myself
and they say, well--

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:55.199 align:middle line:90%
and often they're told, believe

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.767 align:middle line:84%
in yourself come
on, but I don't.

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.469 align:middle line:90%
So, how do you believe yourself

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.304 align:middle line:84%
when you don't believe
in yourself?

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:04.542 align:middle line:84%
So, it is about saying now who
are we really and bit by bit

00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:08.379 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild the relationship
with our truth,

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:12.183 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild the relationship
bit by bit, brick by brick,

00:44:12.183 --> 00:44:15.419 align:middle line:84%
block by block, that we
can change our relationship

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:16.621 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:44:16.621 --> 00:44:18.823 align:middle line:84%
We can awaken up our true
genius, and the source

00:44:18.823 --> 00:44:21.525 align:middle line:84%
and the energy and wisdom
will come through us

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.361 align:middle line:90%
with any relationship.

00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:27.598 align:middle line:84%
We don't go from zero to
married within five seconds.

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We say to ourselves, hold
on a second, and we begin

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.002 align:middle line:90%
to build the relationship.

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:32.903 align:middle line:84%
And eventually someone
says, "Will you marry me?"

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.839 align:middle line:84%
And if it all works
right and it connects

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:37.041 align:middle line:84%
on all the right levels, if
you are the person says yeah,

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.876 align:middle line:84%
'cause that's also
right for me as well.

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:43.781 align:middle line:84%
So, it is about saying our
truth, begin to trust our truth.

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:46.183 align:middle line:84%
People would approach
me then go,

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.718 align:middle line:84%
"So when you change your
life, Derek, can you kind

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:50.354 align:middle line:84%
of move people out of your
life that were not serving you,

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:51.789 align:middle line:84%
that were dishonoring you,
and they're abusing you

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and your service,
and that must take

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:54.859 align:middle line:84%
in courage 'cause you're
earning off those people.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:56.761 align:middle line:84%
That must have taken
a lot of courage.

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:58.295 align:middle line:90%
And I get the question,

00:44:58.295 --> 00:45:00.531 align:middle line:84%
but my response was
actually quite instantaneous.

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.767 align:middle line:84%
I began to say didn't
take any courage

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:08.205 align:middle line:84%
at all 'cause my truth is
more important than courage.

00:45:08.205 --> 00:45:11.275 align:middle line:84%
My truth is stronger
than my courage.

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:14.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Your truth is stronger
than money, than whatever--

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.479 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Than all these
things, you know,

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:17.348 align:middle line:90%
so you don't need courage.

00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:20.251 align:middle line:84%
You just need your truth
and as I stuck with this

00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:22.687 align:middle line:84%
and there was a time of
course when I make my shifts,

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:23.954 align:middle line:90%
and there's a game by--

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:26.724 align:middle line:84%
absolutely opened here and
saying, on our first shift

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and then I move clients
and people out of my life,

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.095 align:middle line:84%
my life took a few
backward steps first.

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:33.764 align:middle line:90%
But I just stick with it

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.433 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't use any
willpower to stick with it.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:36.634 align:middle line:84%
People were saying, it
must have been really hard

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:38.969 align:middle line:84%
when you let go worst
clients or abusing you

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:41.072 align:middle line:84%
and getting you drive everywhere
and do things for them.

00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:42.073 align:middle line:90%
You let go over those clients.

00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.174 align:middle line:84%
It must be hard 'cause
you're already

00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:44.709 align:middle line:90%
in a bad financial position.

00:45:44.709 --> 00:45:47.278 align:middle line:84%
And I would say actually, did--
you know, it must have taken--

00:45:47.278 --> 00:45:48.946 align:middle line:84%
the thing I tend to say was
it must have taken a lot

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:49.914 align:middle line:90%
of willpower.

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:51.515 align:middle line:84%
That's the [inaudible]
come to me.

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:52.616 align:middle line:90%
I would say, no.

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:53.951 align:middle line:90%
It didn't take any willpower,

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:57.388 align:middle line:84%
just took my truth
'cause my truth

00:45:57.388 --> 00:46:00.391 align:middle line:84%
and your truth is more
powerful than any willpower.

00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:04.061 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to fight and
to push and to try and to go

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:07.732 align:middle line:84%
on and-- you just
need to be your truth.

00:46:07.732 --> 00:46:11.669 align:middle line:84%
And people that don't know
me now that some should know

00:46:11.669 --> 00:46:17.441 align:middle line:84%
that my background is around
financials, many investing,

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:20.211 align:middle line:84%
helping keep people to plan
their estates and to save

00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:23.147 align:middle line:84%
and invest money and to make
money forward and look after it

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.849 align:middle line:90%
and to become good custodians.

00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:27.017 align:middle line:84%
I did that for 18 years
the traditional way

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:30.054 align:middle line:84%
and I was completely
an object failure.

00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:84%
When I shift and began to talk
about what my truth really was,

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.725 align:middle line:90%
and I've made to reveal this.

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.294 align:middle line:84%
And to somewhat this
is really all about.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:39.697 align:middle line:84%
That's when things took off
in a way which was, well,

00:46:39.697 --> 00:46:43.167 align:middle line:84%
I got to speak around the
world and to write a book

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of the things
and mentor and teach and guide.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.005 align:middle line:84%
So, it's nothing to
do with the money.

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.976 align:middle line:84%
It was about saying, what is our
truth and are we willing to be--

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.979 align:middle line:84%
truth are we willing to listen
to ourselves and to reopen

00:46:54.979 --> 00:46:59.083 align:middle line:84%
and reengage the relationship
with self, to reengage the light

00:46:59.083 --> 00:47:01.452 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, to
reconnect with that place.

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And the practical
thing that I talked

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.257 align:middle line:84%
about in the book are we stopped
setting goals, I could come back

00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:08.359 align:middle line:84%
to this practical thing,
stop setting goals.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:11.061 align:middle line:84%
If one had a way, if one
learn how to be disconnected

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:13.464 align:middle line:84%
from your truth and to
be tricked by the world,

00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:14.765 align:middle line:90%
you start setting goals.

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:18.302 align:middle line:84%
So-- 'cause your goals for
example for most people are

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.871 align:middle line:84%
around that even
[inaudible] that go, well,

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:24.208 align:middle line:84%
I have one of those to be
successful, I have, you know,

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:27.945 align:middle line:84%
that car, that house, that
income, and must be that weight,

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:29.113 align:middle line:84%
must have that person
in my life,

00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:30.614 align:middle line:90%
and then set all these goals.

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.415 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:32.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's never enough.

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.284 align:middle line:90%
It's never enough.

00:47:33.284 --> 00:47:34.485 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: Yeah, but also what's
the measurement of that?

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:36.453 align:middle line:84%
The measurement of that
is well, according to who,

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:37.488 align:middle line:84%
according to your
truth or according

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:39.290 align:middle line:84%
to what you're seeing
in the world.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.525 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that-- where does that
come from and for most people,

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.860 align:middle line:90%
whether they admit it or not,

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.030 align:middle line:84%
for those who set the base
upon the norms of their entry,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.632 align:middle line:84%
the norms of their business,
the norms of their country,

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:50.201 align:middle line:84%
their community 'cause
you're going to have that car

00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:52.203 align:middle line:84%
and that house was [inaudible],
well, you have this car

00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:53.838 align:middle line:84%
and this house, well,
'cause you see

00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:55.239 align:middle line:84%
if I have them, I'll
be successful.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:90%
According to who?

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.408 align:middle line:90%
By who's measure?

00:47:57.408 --> 00:48:01.045 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
successful people have.

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.446 align:middle line:90%
What's your truth?

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.714 align:middle line:90%
What's truth for you?

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:07.451 align:middle line:84%
Because you can be successful
driving an old VW, yeah,

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.887 align:middle line:84%
with a small amount of money
in your bank just enough

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.156 align:middle line:84%
to get yourself through
because you find your happiness

00:48:12.156 --> 00:48:14.425 align:middle line:84%
and you find your wisdom, and
it's in the finding the wisdom

00:48:14.425 --> 00:48:17.127 align:middle line:84%
and your truth, you'll
be led to prosperity,

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll be led to
wealth as I was.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.031 align:middle line:90%
I didn't--

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:24.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: As your vision is
of wealth, as abundance is

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.302 align:middle line:90%
for you to your standard.

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:27.938 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: And this is the key
things, it's about being--

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.406 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to truth, isn't it?

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.542 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk about
setting standards, you know,

00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:34.144 align:middle line:84%
standard being a
basis, a criteria,

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:90%
a level, a quality or a rule.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.882 align:middle line:84%
You don't just put
those out to the air.

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't make the same
mistakes we've been making

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.119 align:middle line:84%
for the last hundred years in
this world in goal setting.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:44.588 align:middle line:84%
With standards, we go
inside to find them.

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.457 align:middle line:84%
We check them and
then we say, OK.

00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:48.993 align:middle line:84%
What's right for me in this area
of my life, the person health

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:51.562 align:middle line:84%
and fitness environment,
relationship, friends, emotions,

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:53.397 align:middle line:90%
career, time, whatever.

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:57.067 align:middle line:84%
We then say, what's
right inside me for this.

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:59.169 align:middle line:84%
What's the right standard for
me 'cause you're not checking

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:01.872 align:middle line:84%
with your truth, and
your truth now begins

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:04.708 align:middle line:84%
to give you the right standard
for you to practically do

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:07.278 align:middle line:84%
in your job, to practically
do in your life,

00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and to practically do in your
relationship and, you know,

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.115 align:middle line:84%
you know who should not be
in your life and who should,

00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.517 align:middle line:84%
and you find a way breaking
that connection 'cause

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.853 align:middle line:84%
that practically you
would need to do.

00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:18.389 align:middle line:84%
And if you're with
clients or with friends

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:19.556 align:middle line:90%
or with your health, now,

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.458 align:middle line:84%
what are your daily
standards for your health?

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:24.328 align:middle line:84%
Well, your truth knows the
best standard for your health.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.963 align:middle line:84%
So, when you're in
non-self, you just eat

00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and drink whatever you want to
do and don't move very much.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.735 align:middle line:84%
When you got in to like your
truth, you know, you know what,

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:34.104 align:middle line:84%
I do know my truth, I
do know what's right

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:37.808 align:middle line:84%
to keep this vessel going 'cause
this vessel carries the spirit

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:39.443 align:middle line:90%
on this physical plane.

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.645 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that I
let this vessel diminish

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:43.414 align:middle line:90%
or degenerate, I get--

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I lose the opportunity to
carry my spirit on this world.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:48.419 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we find,
so we have to set standards

00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:49.853 align:middle line:90%
around our truth knows,

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:51.855 align:middle line:84%
our truth is the thing
inside the vessel.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:55.292 align:middle line:84%
So, clearly our truth the ones
that carry the vessel, we--

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:59.363 align:middle line:84%
our truth will know that-- what
we should not eat, the fats

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:02.199 align:middle line:84%
and the salts and the
sugar, it knows that.

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:03.567 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take great
intelligence on that

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:09.506 align:middle line:84%
but actually there was no--
there is no written down content

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:13.143 align:middle line:84%
that [inaudible] the world in
milliseconds, 3, 4, 5,000 years.

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:17.214 align:middle line:84%
But the original people
that inhabited the lands,

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:18.849 align:middle line:84%
they knew what was
right for them.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:19.984 align:middle line:90%
They knew what they should eat.

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:22.286 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have the
[inaudible] and elements

00:50:22.286 --> 00:50:25.556 align:middle line:84%
that we suffer today in the
much wiser 21st century.

00:50:25.556 --> 00:50:27.491 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have-- but
we've created this thing--

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:28.993 align:middle line:90%
these things for ourselves.

00:50:28.993 --> 00:50:32.763 align:middle line:84%
So what's coming through for
me is actually your truth,

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:36.166 align:middle line:84%
my truth, all of our truth,
knows what it should be

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.668 align:middle line:84%
and it will begin
to set standards

00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:39.370 align:middle line:90%
for you when we go inside.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And as with all these journeys,
going inside is not enough.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.243 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- it's about
being real and being frank.

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:47.945 align:middle line:84%
When we go inside and
discover our wisdom

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.714 align:middle line:84%
and the right standards for the
areas of our lives, we then have

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:54.418 align:middle line:84%
to set them down, write
them down and then we have

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to commit just for today, just
for today to commit to living

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.427 align:middle line:84%
at the standards discovered
from itself, just for today.

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:05.329 align:middle line:84%
Do not ever do [inaudible]
of your week, your month,

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:08.499 align:middle line:84%
your year, your life, just-- and
that's way there's no pressure.

00:51:08.499 --> 00:51:11.335 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, I'm going to
just quote the Bible once more

00:51:11.335 --> 00:51:12.403 align:middle line:90%
and the Bible says, you know,

00:51:12.403 --> 00:51:15.005 align:middle line:84%
this Lord's prayer
that's Christians--

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.607 align:middle line:90%
was Christians I was taught.

00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:18.442 align:middle line:84%
And then when we do
the Lord's prayer,

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.544 align:middle line:84%
it gives us these four words and
the four words kept coming back

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:23.814 align:middle line:84%
to me again and again and
again, "Give us this day.

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:24.782 align:middle line:90%
Give us this day."

00:51:24.782 --> 00:51:26.450 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say, give
us this week--

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Right.

00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:28.919 align:middle line:84%
>> DM: -- or give us this
month, give us this year,

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:30.020 align:middle line:84%
give us this fiscal year,
give us this quarter.

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.255 align:middle line:84%
I think if Jesus, son
of God or a prophet,

00:51:31.255 --> 00:51:33.223 align:middle line:84%
had meant give us this
week or give us this month,

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:34.258 align:middle line:90%
he would have said so.

00:51:34.258 --> 00:51:35.192 align:middle line:90%
He didn't misspeak.

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.794 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a slip of the tongue.

00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:38.829 align:middle line:84%
He meant give us this day
'cause this is about the day,

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:41.298 align:middle line:84%
about being who we are today,
getting our light and energy

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.934 align:middle line:84%
into the world, today,
loving today, caring today,

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:47.538 align:middle line:84%
