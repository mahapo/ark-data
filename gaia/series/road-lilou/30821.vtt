00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my beautiful
co-creators.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Lilou, for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm in Orlando, Florida
with Michael Cooley, hello.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Lilou.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing well, thank you.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful out here.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Yes, definitely not
as cold as in Europe.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I had to come back to
the US a little bit.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Or as cold as in New
England, where I'm from.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really
cold up there, too.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is great-- great
place to get together.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and a great story.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be so
inspired by this story.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about your
background, because I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:90%
know you're an entrepreneur.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
You're a CEO now and an author.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
But this was definitely not
the case years and years ago,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
when you went through
your rock bottom, which

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:90%
is also the title of your book.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you went through
so that we can understand.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go into--
for everybody watching,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:84%
this is really about going
and reaching your dreams,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:90%
whatever your background.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
you're definitely
the man that says

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to live
those and to live

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:90%
a successful, happy life.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for saying that.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:90%
And I so believe it myself.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
The story of "Rock Bottom"
is the story of my background

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
as is child raised
between a broken home

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
with a mother who
was an alcoholic,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
a father who was a
hard-working blue collar

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:90%
worker, who remarried.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But he married into a family
where my stepmother, who

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
had two children of our own that
were older-- we quickly learned

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:84%
going into that family
what child abuse was

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:84%
from mental, physical, sexual,
emotional abuse that went on

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
in that family with my
little brother and me

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
for over a decade,
to my mother's home

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
up in Saint Louis,
where we moved

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:84%
from apartment to apartment
to apartment, kicked out.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:90%
She was an alcoholic.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
We had nine different
step fathers growing up.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:90%
There was abuse there.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So we went from one
abusive home to another,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
never went to the
same elementary school

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
twice in a row in a year, and
sometimes went to and three

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:90%
different elementary schools.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So we were traveling all
over, going through this abuse

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
until I reached the point at
15 where I left home for good.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
I went out on the road.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
I hitchhiked all over.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I lived on the streets.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in St. Louis sleeping
in alleyways and rooftops

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and any shanty I could
find, beg, borrowing,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and stealing for money.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Ended up finding a new family.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.872 align:middle line:84%
That family turned out
to be a street gang.

00:02:41.872 --> 00:02:42.905 align:middle line:90%
We ended up running the street.

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of kids that
were lost, like I was,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
going to abusive situations
with their families.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we were a group of
kids that were filled with rage

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and anger, and we
were out hurting

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
people and doing bad things
and getting in trouble.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It landed me in lockup
and incarceration.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Then eventually--
I'm now my 20s--

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Not now, but you were then.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
No, now, as the
story goes, right?

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Even though I may look 20--no.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Definitely not 20-- but in my
20 I was hitting rock bottom,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
living out of a broken down car,
getting cleaned up in a rest

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
stop, traveling aimlessly
with nowhere to go,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
trying to get gas
money, in lockup again.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I actually hit
rock bottom, and that

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:90%
was the end of the road for me.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And if I was going to
stay on this path I was

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
going to stay on, I was going
to end up dead, in prison,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:90%
or insane.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So I took a road that I'd
never been down before.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I took a job in a mail
room at minimum wage.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I met some incredible people
who helped me along the way, who

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:84%
inspired me, who
helped me learn,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
help me to get an education,
helped me to get a good job.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me
how to be human again.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.231 align:middle line:84%
Because you felt
like an animal before.

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt like an animal
that was caged.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.275 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
when an animal who

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
is caged, who was
constantly beaten, as I felt

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
happened as I was
a kid and teenager?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:90%
They do one of two things.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Either they curl up and die, or
they lash out in rage as soon

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:90%
as they have the chance.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, I did the latter.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I lashed out in rage,
ran the streets,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:90%
and it was a crazy time.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was destined
to die, but I chose

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
this path that I'd
never been down

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:90%
before, where I knew no one.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Before I chose this path, nobody
wanted anything to do with me.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I was that animal.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I was dangerous.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
People were afraid of me.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And when I took that path
that I took down that road

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and I met the people that I met,
I joined the company I joined.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I then developed out
to be human again,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
learned how to be
socially aware,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and actually learned
how to communicate.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people say I still
can't communicate,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
but I talk better than used
to, let me tell you that.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And so I went down this road.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I developed my career.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I went from the mail
room at minimum wage

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to senior vice president of
operations for a $40 million

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:90%
consulting firm.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I went on there
to senior director

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:84%
of administration
for a $70 million

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
health care records company.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And then from there I was
recruited out of Dallas

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
up to New England, where
for the last six years

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
have been the CEO of a national
records management company.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
And so I have a great family.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I have a great wife and kids.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a great company
I work for, great people

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that I'm surrounded by.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
All of that said, I just
shouldn't be this lucky.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So after going
through everything

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I went through, having
everything I have

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:90%
today, I look in the mirror.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:90%
I think about it.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I say, you know,
this story needs

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
to be an example for others.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I can use my past to
help others with their future.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I know you speak in
companies and in prisons

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
also in home shelters
and everywhere,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and your true heart desire
is to inspire people.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Here, I feel for people
looking for their purpose

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
or something, or at
least a meaning in life,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
because, I guess, did
you have a meaning?

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you were just
surviving at that time, right?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
That's all it
was, was a survival

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%
instinct, just to survive.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But the whole-- so you'd think
that the end of the story,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.360 align:middle line:84%
the end of "Rock Bottom"
from the streets to success

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
could be I went
from the streets,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and now I have what
many deem to be success.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.664 align:middle line:90%
You head up a company.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
You've got a great family.
You've got the house.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.719 align:middle line:90%
You've got the car.

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
community involvement.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:90%
You've got all that.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, my real success

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from what I'm able to do
today, which is to your comment

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I speak to groups.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I speak to people.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to do is try
to use my story to maybe help

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
not only those who are trying
to come from rock bottom,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
but those who already have
success, they have all of that.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
But they still have a
real purpose in life.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all about making money,
the bottom line, what trip we're

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:90%
going on, how big our house is.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And what I've learned that
it's much more than that.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
To me, when I look at my kids,
and I try to develop character

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
in them, and I have them come
with me when I'm speaking

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
at homeless shelters or
prisons and how can we

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
help as a society to
inspire people to,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their
circumstances are,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to change it and be more
than they ever thought

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
could happen based on
how they were raised.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I was the kid that was told
that you'll never be anything,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I wish you were never
born, I wish you were dead,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I want you out, and not just by
parents, but by other people,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
by stepfamily.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't want
anything to do with me.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
We were the kids that never
should have been born.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But yet today we are
able to give back.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
My little brother who went
through the same situation

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
as I have, he has three
successful car dealerships

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
in St. Louis, and he
has incredible family,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and his children
are doing very well.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, we are
hopefully examples of people;

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
no matter how low
your rock bottom is,

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.830 align:middle line:84%
you can be anything
you want to be.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
there, once you get

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
to becoming human again, what
are you going to do with that?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But I guess not everybody
went through such

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
a huge rock bottom,
but we maybe went

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:84%
through different versions of
that and different messages

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:90%
that we received growing up.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when we don't hit
that rock bottom, where we're

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in a situation where we can
be very a sad or even angry

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.110 align:middle line:84%
or don't know how to get
out of the situation,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
what is your
recommendation to step out

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and to live kind of
like you're lucky now.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
You live it, and
your brother, too.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that was on your past?

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Was that really a commitment
of yours at some point?

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I believe in
fate, and there's a lot of fate

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
involved with my life and
what's happened in that regard.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:84%
However, from a
purpose standpoint,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn how to do
everything again, including

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
just being out here
in front of people,

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to be speaking in
front of people.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was the guy that
if we had a big meeting,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:84%
would hide behind a
curtain because he didn't

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
want to be called on
or noticed because

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:90%
of my incredible insecurity.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But now today I'm speaking
to thousands of people,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
get me to shut up.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's more then just being
out there speaking to people,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
telling the story
of "Rock Bottom."

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's more about how
you can connect the two

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
haves with the have nots and
how you can make a difference

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%
on a larger more global scale.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'll be speaking
in a homeless shelter at night.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the next day
as a CEO, I might

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
be signing a six-figure
contract with a workers agency

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.250 align:middle line:90%
to use their employees.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
they know my story.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I match the agency with
the homeless shelter,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and they're suddenly
putting people to work.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is making a
difference and using a purpose,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I
deem to be success.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody that'll
hear my story

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and travel on
three or four buses

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
to see me because they want
their three-year-old to have

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
a positive role
model in their like

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
because they've dealt with
so much abuse and issues

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:90%
from a male.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that
said, that is the kind

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
of stories, the kind of
inspiration I hope to provide.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why I told
"Rock Bottom" because I

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
hope it's used to help
others with their future.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
trying to do as a goal,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:84%
as a business leader as
well as personal leader.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So for you it' really serving,
being there of service,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
giving of your time, giving
back to the community.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.440 align:middle line:84%
For you, this is really a
big part of success, what

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
would you see success as now.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It is, and so stop me
if you've heard this,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
but you have the people
that will tell you

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that the only time anybody
wants anything to do with me

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
or comes around and
sees me is if they

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
want me to drive them somewhere,
or they want me to pay.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
They only when me to go out
with them because I'm buying.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
That everybody's
always using me.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:90%
My kids are using me.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:90%
My parents are using me.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's using me.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, to that end, to this
day, I tell everybody I talk

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
to that I want you to use me.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
How can you use
me to help others?

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:90%
And how can you use this story?

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is my passion is to
see what happens to people when

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
college kids and speak
at the university

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
are getting ready to
start their whole career

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and their whole
life, and they're

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:84%
trying to decide what they're
going to do with their future,

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and they hear a story like
this, whatever they're doing

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:84%
in their future, they
can tie the inspiration

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
that they can become to
help others along the way.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of
stuff that's really truly

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
moving to me and gives
me great gratitude,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
gives me great appreciation
for what I've gone through.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you
recommend to kids,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to kids
coming out of school?

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.840 align:middle line:90%
What would you tell them?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Do really just serve
unconditionally and let

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
life bring you, or also,
are you into planning,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
or what is your recommendation
to them for their future,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and which we can all apply
anywhere we're at in our Life

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and actually, it's
going to be each person's going

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%
to develop their own path.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But the two things you
said were critical.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
One is everything is
done with a purpose.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:90%
There's a plan.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very detailed planner
from the moment I get up,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:90%
to the end the day.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
planning about it,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:25.120 align:middle line:84%
but there's also the opportunity
of unconditional assistance

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
whenever it's needed.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So you might have a plan
throughout your day,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll get a call
that somebody needs some help,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and you need to stop what you're
doing because that person,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
you might be the helping
hand that changes

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:90%
their life in that regard.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And so now that I do this
speaking, I get a lot of those

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
calls from somebody with a
challenge with their daughter

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
or their son, or somebody
incarcerated will write me

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
from prison with
their challenges,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and if I can help somebody who
will be getting out of prison

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:90%
and be in a halfway house.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.820 align:middle line:84%
A business leader who has
everything in the world, that

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
running a large
company, but they're

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
challenged with their
daughter, what can

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I do to give back
in that regard?

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know
how they can help.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
To the Catholic
Diocese or a church

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that may contact you to say,
how can we reach these teens?

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things
that I look for.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So you have your plan, and you
look for these fateful things

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that come your way,
and you say that you're

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
just called to go do something
unconditionally in that regard.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I agree that you
have to be prepared for that.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to be prepared for
the life you want to live.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's in college,
getting an education,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
building your future,
getting a good job.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that may be
your plan to do

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that, but never
forget the that's just

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:90%
a means to get you through.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
But life is a
long, long journey,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to find a point
where you're going to need

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
a purpose, and it goes way
beyond how big your house

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
is, how much money you have.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:84%
You have to do something for
your soul and for hopefully

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
to help the souls of others,
and that's what I hope to leave,

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:90%
when I leave as a legacy.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I hope my kids carry it on
[INAUDIBLE] to helping others.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lot to say
for somebody who was angry

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
at the world and felt
wronged by the world,

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:90%
and felt abused to say--

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Not worthy,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
--and not worthy at
all, and felt like he

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:90%
didn't deserve to be alive.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And then now today I'm
saying, I'm not doing enough.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do more.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get out there.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get more
in front of people.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And so what I tried to do was
stories like this was speaking

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
my story to get an audience to
say, maybe of the 200 people

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
you speak to, maybe a
couple of them are moved,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and they go out and
change the world.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And the incredible people I've
met along the way, that's kind

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:90%
of been their purpose as well.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been really
moving for me and inspirational,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of drives me
in who I am today, I think.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And in those hard
moments, I guess,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
you still have them, moments,
what do you go back to?

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I do drawback, but
here's the main point.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] I can help out in
this way-- basketball game,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and your daughter's
cheerleading,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
divide and conquer.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But my most hectic day
today, or my worst day today,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
is better than my
best day 25 years ago.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so believe me, I
like those challenges.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
But you do have to manage
and plan it and decide

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.974 align:middle line:90%
you can only deliver so much.

00:16:38.974 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you live a life of--
and please come back here.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it about being 100%
responsible in our lives

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:90%
for what happens?

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:90%
How do you see that?

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and that is the truth.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
to make that choice

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in your life to be responsible
and take responsibility for it.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And the blame game is only
going to get your so far.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, it's
still going to come

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
back to what you can do.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you want
to know how that works,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
have a day when nobody's
there, and you have

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:90%
nobody there to assist you.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make
those decisions.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of choices
you should make about life.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's your boss
breathing down your neck,

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your [INAUDIBLE]
want you to do something,

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
you have so many things
going on, at the end the day,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to take responsibility

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
for those choices that you make.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You may not control how
people respond to you,

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
but you have to
be able to control

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:84%
how you respond to people
in challenges and so on.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you can control.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:84%
So at the end the day, it
is only up to you, isn't it?

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:90%
It is not to somebody else.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's the way
I choose to feel about it.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
kids that have-- it's

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.540 align:middle line:84%
a problem in the US--
that have problems

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
with drugs or even
alcohol at a young age,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:90%
what's your advice on that?

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Like kids that refuse
authority, that

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
want to just really the
break the whole-- no family,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for whatever
reason the parents

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
are in this situation of having
kids with an addiction problem,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:90%
what do you say?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Right, and again,
you're exactly right.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
When it has to do
with drugs, it's

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the worst case
scenario for a parent.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.670 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] that just because
they went through abuse,

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that was an excuse
for me to do drugs.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Again, that was not.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of kids out
there experiment who

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
have great parents, and they're
doing the best they can,

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and then they get
hit with something

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
devastating like that.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to respond, especially

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
those who've never
done drugs themselves,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and their children are doing it.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It is a scary, scary
thing that you would find

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:90%
yourself laying awake at night.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I hear from
the people that I'm speaking to.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
help where I can,

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:90%
using my background experience.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think the key
is from day one,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
you have to be involved
with your kids' lives--

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:90%
from day one.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
be a partnership.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're a single parent,
it is challenging enough,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
but if you're a
husband and wife,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
you have to be in
connection, and you

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
have to be a part
of your kid's life,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
divide and conquer.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Like we have two kids, and
the thing I say right now

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
is at least it's two
against two, right?

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you have parents
that are on their own,

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
they have to stay involved
in their kid's life,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.202 align:middle line:84%
and they have to stay
involved throughout,

00:19:40.202 --> 00:19:41.235 align:middle line:90%
and they have to ask questions.

00:19:41.235 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They have to be involved.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:90%
They can't be their best friend.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.460 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be
parents from the end

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
because those kids need them
to guide them through that part

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:90%
of their life.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.275 align:middle line:84%
But let's say you find out that
your kid is in that situation,

00:19:54.275 --> 00:20:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and one of them is having a big
drug issue, how would you react

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
or how would you take
it from that point?

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:90%
It starts there.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.345 align:middle line:84%
It starts with when
you discover that

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and when you find
that out, and then

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the talking that goes on behind
it, sitting down with them,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.780 align:middle line:90%
talking with them about it.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The thing in my case
is I'm going to be

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:90%
able to relate to experience.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] that you
don't know what it's like

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.740 align:middle line:84%
because you've never done
that particular drug.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can almost guarantee
you in any case I have done

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that particular drug, and
I know what it does to you,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and how the euphoria
starts in the beginning.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:90%
But I also know how it ends up.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and able to be
able to describe those stories

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to them and tell them
those stories to them,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
frankly, sometimes scares
the hell out of those kids

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:90%
that haven't seen that yet.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that shocks
it out of their system.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And not only do they
stopped doing that,

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
they actually start becoming
an advocate for changing that.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, trying to surround them
with other kids that also know

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
what drugs are
going to do to you

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
and don't want any part of
it, and they'll help them

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
through that, versus
surrounding yourself with people

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that they think they
have all the answers.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And these kids are
doing the drugs

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and trying to suck them in.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It just goes back to being
involved with your kids' lives.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So the environment
is super important?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your kids involved
in stuff other than just

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:90%
hanging out, from athletics.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a program in my house
called the AAA program.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And the rewards that go
along with that program

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
include achieving your
success in academics,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
in athletics, and in the arts.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So whatever that
is, so, for example,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
my son's grades are in receiving
A's in those areas, right?

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's the AAA program.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
There's rewards and are tied to
what you do in grades-- making

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
the honor role and what
that achieves-- what you do

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in athletics, as far as
how hard you practice

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and playing on the teams and
being involved with that,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to the arts, whether it
be computer graphics,

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it be drawing, whether
it be painting. [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
around the art
side and the grades

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and the achievements
you have in there.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that gives them a
purpose, a plan, a goal in that

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:90%
regard.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
as a family reward,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
so they'll be
thinking about that

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and the ramifications
of if they're

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.650 align:middle line:84%
not successful in that
area how we do that.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's a long
way from where I

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
came from, where I
dropped out of school

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:90%
and had no interest at school.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if a teacher
yelled at me,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I'd just leave the
classroom and not come back.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Education wasn't important.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.025 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize till later in
life when I went back to school

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and went back and got my degree
how hungry I was to learn

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and how much more I
could do with knowledge.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're successful,
financially wise,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.110 align:middle line:90%
but this is more than that.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
You decided to bring
out this book out

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and to speak about your story
and speak to everybody really,

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:84%
even the people that knew
you not from that background,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's only later,
from my understanding,

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:90%
that you decided to open up.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Is that essential, do you
feel, to open up to be true,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to be ourselves, and
to fully come out,

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:90%
whatever the coming out is?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, it truly is freeing
when I told the story

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.963 align:middle line:90%
and when I came out about it.

00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things I had to do

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:84%
was go back with the people
who didn't know my past,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.261 align:middle line:84%
from the owner of the company to
family and friends and members

00:23:24.261 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.905 align:middle line:84%
Like I told him
about it, and I've

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
got to tell you,
[INAUDIBLE] the commitment

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I had to make when I
came out with the book

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:84%
was I wasn't going to judge
whatever the reaction was.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've got reactions
that run the gambit.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But most and overall I got
reactions of people who truly

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:90%
cared, who truly embraced it.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I speak,
a lot of people

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.810 align:middle line:84%
ask if I've gone through
therapy or if I'm

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:90%
in therapy related to it.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them that this
is my therapy right here.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Being in front of them and
seeing what it does to them

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what's happened
to them, it drives me.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It helps me.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It helps me learn.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And it helps me be
a better person,

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
I'm trying to do.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So they are my therapy
when I do that.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure I need a lot of
different kinds of therapies,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:84%
but that's just one
way I feed that.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:84%
This is beautiful
because a lot of people

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
are going after the next book,
the next video, the next thing.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But you're really living on
the field, not in the stands.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, true, and again the
goal, as you mentioned,

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.600 align:middle line:90%
it's not financial.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
I have everything I could
ever want in that regard.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the fact that I
have to get this story out

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that
it can help somebody.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, for selfish
reasons, it feeds my own soul.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:90%
It feeds my own purpose.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day, I
hope it also helps other people

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and feeds their soul and their
purpose, and they have a plan.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.910 align:middle line:84%
If we can summarize everything
that we said or some things

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that are important to mention
or at the core of your message,

00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:90%
what would that be?

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Well I think one
of the things that's

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
key to do what I mentioned is
the fact that "Rock Bottom" is

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
about refusing to fail, about no
matter what your circumstances

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
are, there are examples
out there, way beyond me,

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
of people who have taken
their worst circumstances

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and turned it into extreme
success and a purpose

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:90%
to help others.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I think mine is just
but one story to do that.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.985 align:middle line:84%
The other story I'll say is
"Rock Bottom" is also not

00:25:30.985 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:84%
the story about what you
have, what you were given,

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
what was afforded to you, what
the government's given you,

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
what your family's given
you to get you started.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's about the choice that
you make to make a difference.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, I don't
care what the job is

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and what level the job is.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
My goal is that every
job that I've ever had,

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I try to take it
to that next level.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you never know where
it'll take you ultimately.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's key, and
I think another key is who you

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
surround yourself with,
the kind of people

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.550 align:middle line:90%
you surround yourself with.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And we talk to our kids
about it all the time.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Don't be hanging
out with that kid.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
They're bad news.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not good news.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:84%
But as adults,
too, are you going

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.141 align:middle line:84%
to have people that are
constantly negative to you

00:26:17.141 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:90%
on the job?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to have
people that are constantly

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.210 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] how you should
live and what you should be

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:90%
and that idea will never work?

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to have people
that are feeding your soul

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and telling you, you can
be anything you want to be?

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
"Rock Bottom" says.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
You can be anything
that you want to be,

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:90%
no matter where you come from.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Awesome, Michael, this was
really good. [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Florida, and I know
you're flying back home.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I am, yes, and I can't wait.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
My son broke his ankle playing
basketball while I was away,

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and so I've got to
get back to him,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
see what's going on there
because he's going to be pretty

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.120 align:middle line:84%
down about being off
the basketball team

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:84%
while he's hurt, so looking
forward to getting back tonight

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the kids,
and I really, really

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.310 align:middle line:84%
appreciate you taking
time to come out here

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:90%
and coming together like this.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, my beautiful
co-creators out there,

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:90%
much, much love.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've enjoyed this
video, and we're here.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.710 align:middle line:84%
We're here to send more
inspiration and love

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:90%
and happiness around the globe.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:27:19.019 --> 00:27:20.334 align:middle line:90%
Bye.
