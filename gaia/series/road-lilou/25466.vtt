00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my delicious
co-creators.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Lilous here.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.041 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Toulouse, South of
France with Michael Roads.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Hellos, Michael.
-Good morning, Lilou.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.250 align:middle line:90%
It's lovely being here.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
It's cold and brisk and you look
as if it's a hot summer day.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely
gorgeous weather.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.079 align:middle line:90%
This man is from Australia.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.494 align:middle line:84%
It's cloudy.
It's cold.

00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:90%
It's gorgeous.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.756 align:middle line:84%
But those clouds,
aren't they great?

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they're shining.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They're beaming
out, aren't they?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.650 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.785 align:middle line:90%
They're our sun.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
When you're with nature, you
can create your own rules

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:90%
to a certain extent.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
When I was about nine
years old, I used to go

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:90%
and visit a friend of mine.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
He had a great aunt
and she was in her 90s.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And she lived in a terraced
house and the back of the house

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:90%
was a very small garden.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it had about three
meter walls all around it.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I at nine, knew
a lot about plants.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I had a collection
of about 200 or 300.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would go in her garden
and everything was in flower.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And most of it was in pots,
but everything was in flower.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't understand it.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Because generally
speaking, for most plants,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:90%
flowers are the result of sun.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
There are many
specialist plants.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
But generally, the sun is
what brings out the flower.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And in her garden, the sun
hardly ever got in there.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.500 align:middle line:84%
It was in there maybe, even
in the summer, only an hour

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:90%
or two or three at the most.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, everything
was in flower.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And I used to think about this.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
How come these
things are in flower?

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:90%
They shouldn't be.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was watching
her and she stood there,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and she radiating love.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wow, she's
the sun in the garden.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Her love was the sun in that
little back yard garden.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I never forgot
that, obviously.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Since then you really have
this love affair with nature,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
and you have this is a
special bond with it.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And I find that this is
essential in our society right

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
now to go back to nature,
to connect with it,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.760 align:middle line:84%
to see how beautiful it
is, how it is there for us.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.260 align:middle line:84%
What is to you,
the role of nature?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, before we can
connect really with nature,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
we have to connect
with ourselves.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Before we can
connect with nature,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
we have to see that
there's no separation,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and that, if we
look from our eyes

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
over at those trees and
the plants around us,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:90%
we see the space between them.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So we believe that
we're separate.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a world with
the illusion of separation.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
We have words like oneness,
but they're just words.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Scientists talk about a
unified field of energy,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:90%
but they never experienced it.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So they have that
intellectually.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They tell us for instance of
the movement, of shall we say,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a bear in Canada affects
a movement of maybe

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:90%
a kangaroo in Australia.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's very nice
as a scientific fact,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
but to experience
that connection,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that unified field of energy,
is something very different.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
connecting with nature,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
you have to do is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
realize that, shall
we say a tree,

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that is a field of energy.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And you are a field of energy.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And the fields of
energy are not separate.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if, as a
field of energy, you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
go to a tree that is
a field of energy,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.090 align:middle line:84%
you connect in a
place of oneness.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a person
communicating with a tree.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
like that at all.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
There is energy
exchanging energy.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, all energy is information.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:90%
All information is energy.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
approach a tree, you

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.292 align:middle line:84%
are radiating information to
that tree whether you know it

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:84%
People go and talk to the
tree and ask it questions.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to ask it.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It's already-- it's
like, nature doesn't

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%
have to learn to talk with us.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:90%
We have to learn to listen.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.779 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing you've got

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
to do if you're going to
really communicate with a tree

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
is get past this
communication barrier.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:90%
And you do that by listening.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So a tree occupies a moment.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:90%
We also occupy the moment.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:90%
But we think.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And thinking takes
you out of the moment.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
You cannot think your
way into the moment.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So you think about that
when you're not thinking.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:84%
You cannot think your
way into the moment.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And people are thinking
like 60,000 thoughts a day,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
probably about 80% of
them, negative thoughts.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Trees are not doing that.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no thinking.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no negative
thoughts going on.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And so people get
disconnected from each other.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And disconnected is a good word.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
People are disconnected
from life, from the self,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:90%
and therefore from nature.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:90%
But nature is connected.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything in nature is
connected in that unified field

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not an
intellectual connection.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And we always think that this
has got to be intellectual.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So nature has no intellect
but it has intelligence.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It has consciousness,
despite what

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:90%
science says to the country.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So a tree doesn't
grow just a tree.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The tree is the
physical reflection

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:90%
and a metaphysical mirror.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll rephrase that.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the physical
reflection from the mirror

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of a greater reality.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.315 align:middle line:84%
Where the physical
tree is, there

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is also a metaphysical
tree, which

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:90%
means beyond the physical.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
communication takes place.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So you mean there is this aura
field around the tree itself

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
it happens like us?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can
see that aura field

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
but the metaphysical tree
is far more than that.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
It's much greater
than the physical.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It's far more beautiful.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It has many colors and it's
just a complete field of energy,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:90%
as is the physical tree.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But the field of energy
from which it expresses,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I have seen trees
cut down physically

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen the metaphysical
trees still standing there.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're not about
to cut that down.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same with us.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You lose your physical body,
but you're still alive,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and you're still a being.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
You're still a person.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But you no longer
have a physical body.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.520 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same in nature.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
we are immortal.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Which is nice.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:90%
It sort of lasts a long time.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so every human
being is immortal,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
no human being is born
and no human being dies.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the same in nature.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is born.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Nothing dies.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
But in nature, the consciousness
of nature knows this.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So nature has no
relationship with death.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't exist
in its reality frame.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a relationship with
death because we fear it.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we've created
something fearful.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:90%
But there is no such thing.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So you sit beneath a tree and
you allow your field of energy

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.460 align:middle line:90%
to connect.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Is that at this point, do we
have to raise our own frequency

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:90%
also to be there?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that,
so I was wondering.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:90%
What an interesting question.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Many people couldn't
do this because they

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:90%
would sit there and think.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you're sitting there
and you're not thinking,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're just a silent
as you can be but certainly

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts are raised.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:90%
If you have raised.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, you're thinking love
and respect and appreciation,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
That definitely
lifts your energy.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what the
transition's all about,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:90%
this energetic shift.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And the dimensional
shift, it's pure energy,

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
pure consciousness.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Anyway and so you
listen, you listen.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
Now I used to go
down by the river.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:90%
And I had an old bridge board.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And I would sit there each day.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I would spend an hour or
two listening to the river.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And at first all I heard
was the physical river.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It took me six
years of going down

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:90%
to learn to listen to nature.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I used to just sit and listen.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And one time I was down
there and the river

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:90%
said, do you see me as new?

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I didn't.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to
learn to see newness.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned was,
only the newness of me

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.950 align:middle line:84%
could see the newness of life
and the newness of a river.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
But when I learned how
to finally do that,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.979 align:middle line:84%
it's as though the river stopped
flowing on the outside of me

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:90%
and flowed through me.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I was-- and I don't
mean the physical mean.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't like rivers flowing
from the physical me.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't help
with your breathing.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Don't even like rain
flowing through me.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is,
and so the field of energy

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
allows nature to
move through it.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we see ourselves walking
in a forest through nature.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you move into
yourself as a field of energy,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
you can sit in
the forest and let

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
the forest move through you.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But people don't
do that, especially

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:90%
when they get my age.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh, I walked
25 kilometers a day

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
through such and such forest.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Another one, oh, I did 30 today.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that good.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to a group of
these ones and I said to them,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
did anybody ever consider doing
like 100 meters of actually

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:90%
seeing what you walk past?

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Having a loop, and looking at
the holes of trap door spiders

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how many spider
holes on little trap doors

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
there are just along
five meters of ground.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course they
didn't do that.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't receive the
comment very well either.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, you have to begin with
the idea-- it's not an idea.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a truth.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.520 align:middle line:90%
It is a reality.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But you have to begin by
moving into the direction

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
that you, as being of
energy, can expand that.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
There's no borders
and boundaries

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:90%
to the field of energy you are.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you expand, you
connect with every other field

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
of energy on the
planet until every tree

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:90%
and everything is within self.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you realize there's
nothing outside self.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And that self is
the being you are.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to that place,
then communicating with nature

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:90%
is just a matter of listening.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Because nature is in the moment.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
You're in the moment
and communication flows.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't really have
to say or think anything

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:90%
because you're communicating.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
By being in the moment,
your field of energy

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:90%
is communicating.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:90%
It's in constant communication.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is going to
be a bit controversial.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably
like that anyway.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But our DNA, on a
metaphysical level,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
are like a worm
hole or a vortex.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You're familiar
with a the wormhole?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as we have input coming
into us through our chakras,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
which are the wheels
of energy within us,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:90%
that go into our cells.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.520 align:middle line:90%
In the cells is the DNA.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The DNA takes all that
energy, our input,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and communicates it
out to the world,

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
simply as energy,
beyond the world,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:90%
right out through the universe.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It's all communicated as energy.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
those wormholes

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
are receiving energy,
which is information

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%
from the universe around us.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.240 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
that stage, then you

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
can move into a point of what is
called mystical cognition, what

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I call direct knowing.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by that is, I was
sitting down by the river once.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And I was actually listening.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I was in the moment.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the
moment you're not there.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you get that?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're here
and everywhere.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, your body is there.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Your body is there.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But you're sending out
the waves of discord

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:90%
that thoughts sent out.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Human thoughts are like waves of
discord going out into nature.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.430 align:middle line:84%
If those thoughts were loving
and appreciative, like if you

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
go to Keukenhof
in the Netherlands

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
tulip fields, there's

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
thousands of people
in there, but they go

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:90%
because they love the flowers.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a
beautiful energy.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Too many people,
but lovely energy.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that creates a
beautiful field of energy.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So lifting your thoughts
that way is very good.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So when your feeling
is being transmitted

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
as information energy out
into the universe and you're

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
also receiving.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when you
get into this stage

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:90%
of what I call direct knowing.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Now as I said, I was sitting
by the river one day,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
sitting so still and silent,
that a big gray heron came

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and sat in the
river just a little

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:84%
away from me, a few
meters, maybe 5, 10 meters.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And it very clearly
didn't see me.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet I'm sitting
in full view,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:90%
but there was no disturbance.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so nature doesn't
see us just as objects,

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:90%
it sees us as energy.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And my energy was
still and quiet.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And even it coming
down, I was aware of it,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.720 align:middle line:90%
but nothing happened.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It didn't disturb
my field of energy.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea how
long it stood there,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
but these were very shy
birds in that river area.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
how long it was there

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because I was in the
moment, and in the moment,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.680 align:middle line:84%
there's no linear
time, obviously.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the head of
the heron speared down

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and it came up with
little fish, which

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:90%
it flipped round and swallowed.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And a thought came in,
which I didn't really want,

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but the thought was, oh,
that's not very nice.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, the bird
like, gave a great croak,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
like it had seen
me and it took off.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And as it took off, from the
consciousness of this heron,

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and not this heron, the whole
species, there's like a bubble,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
like a moat of
knowing came into me.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
exactly the process.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I knew the whole process as
though you look at a book,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and as you see the cover,
you know every word

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that's written in it.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
It's instant.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:90%
This is how we can communicate.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:84%
This is how, if we
were to move into

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:90%
our conscious intelligence.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew in that moment,
I knew exactly the relationship

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of the heron and the fish.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in that
moment the relationship

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of every animal that
eats another animal,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:90%
exactly how it works.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I know, that's the title
of your new book, Conscious

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence, isn't it?

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.020 align:middle line:90%
I love those two words together.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't often
hear them together.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Well you see, you go
together, because most

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:90%
people live subconsciously.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Subconsciously, you
can use your intellect,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:84%
but you cannot subconsciously
use intelligence.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So intelligence should always
be called conscious intelligence

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
because you can't use
it if you're not fully

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
conscious, which is
why we have the world

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
in the mess we're in today.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's perfect, because
it's everybody's classroom.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But if everybody
used intelligence

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
consciously, then the world--
we wouldn't do the things we do.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't criticize people we
love because it doesn't work.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't criticize ourselves
because it doesn't work.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:90%
We would live very differently.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But we live subconsciously,
which means more of the same.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday repeated.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes the week, yes, the
year, yes, the lifetime.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we think 60,000
thoughts a minute.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Those thoughts are repetitive.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Words change, like computers
and technology and things

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.990 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the thrust and the
direction of our thoughts

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:90%
we've created over millennia.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And they become the flow of our
consciousness, the movement,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:90%
the direction we're going.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't change.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And the name of that
generally, is more

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:90%
of the same, more of the same.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to be safe
and secure, more of the same.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:90%
People don't like taking risks.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
What's a risk to
an immortal being?

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
The most dangerous
stuff we're facing today

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:90%
is more of the same.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Like people are frightened
of earth changes.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:90%
That should be welcome.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
What is terrifying is continuing
with more of the same.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.296 align:middle line:90%
That's the scary thought.

00:16:24.296 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So starting to
communicate with nature

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and starting to connect on
an energy level, which you're

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
explaining and being
conscious there

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:84%
in the moment and
bonding with it

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
is, for you, the
answer to our society?

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You think it's a big clue?
-No.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
the answer at all.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer is learning
what it means to love,

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:90%
unconditional love.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.471 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what nature
teaches us, isn't it?

00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't because
nobody's listening.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:90%
But it does that.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:90%
It did that to you, didn't it?

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really
was-- well, yeah.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It took me a while-- you see,
my first connection with nature

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:90%
was away from people.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like people.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
My model and father, they
lied to me very young.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
They told me if
you go to school,

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
there will be
lovely people there

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
called teachers who will look
after you and teach you things.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't lovely.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
And all they thought me was
how to lie to survive school.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was a very dominant,
right-brained child

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:84%
in a very left-brained school,
which is just like putting

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.380 align:middle line:90%
a pelican in with polar bears.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work at all.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And so, I had to lie to survive.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:90%
And I left school at 14.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean I didn't even get
a certificate as a sign

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:90%
of ever being at school.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.535 align:middle line:84%
But what I did find
there was reading.

00:17:43.535 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I loved reading.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I read about
things that I enjoyed.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:90%
And one of those was nature.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I read a
lot about nature.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I began a
relationship with nature.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
When I was six, my father
brought home 12 tomato plants.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And he gave six to me and
he put six in for himself.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, they're
yours to look after.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I used to go
to school at six.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And every day I came home,
I'd dig out my tomato plants

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and look at the roots to
see if they were growing.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
On after about two weeks,
his were looking good

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
and mine were not
looking good at all.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And he was looking
at them one day.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
They'd been in
there maybe a month.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.925 align:middle line:84%
And mine were really
sick by this stage.

00:18:22.925 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I
can't understand it.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
They're exactly the
same plants as mine.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can't
understand it either.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:84%
I keep digging them up
and looking at the roots

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and they won't grow.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So then he laughed and told
me, OK, you don't do that.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at these tomato
plants when I set them,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and they did recover when
I stopped digging them up.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
help but thinking,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:90%
what an incredible thing.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
They put down little
roots into the ground,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and they become
something different.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They bear these lovely
red fruits, tomatoes.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.760 align:middle line:90%
And it struck me as marvelous.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But as I got older,
I realized that most

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
people put roots in the ground
and like to be anchored.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
safe and secure.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, they want to put
their roots into the money

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and the positions and wealth.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:84%
That becomes,
instead of the soil,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:84%
they use wealth and
things like that

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and put their roots into
that and become just

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
as anchored and just a stuck
and static as my tomato plants

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no difference.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of the moments
where I had so many big panic

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
attacks and going through myself
through this is huge money

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:90%
and crisis challenge.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I feel a lot of people are
going through that right now.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we have those
huge panic attacks

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
and it feels like
in that moment,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
there was only nature
that could do something.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
There was only--
not do something,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:84%
but that's where I was
coming from at the time.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, from
that suffering place,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
there is this opening that
was created in the heart.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, sometimes
nature absorbs also and helps

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
us to go through
those hard moments

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:90%
and can lift us up, literally.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean to me, they're are huge
key to huge challenging times

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.191 align:middle line:84%
that the world is going
through right now.

00:20:12.191 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure whether
you're trying

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to keep me talking about
nature or whether you

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:90%
actually believe what you said.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe nature
took you out of your panic.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I think you grew through it.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And you shifted your
focus, and began

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to find your security
more in your heart

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.113 align:middle line:90%
than in everything around you.

00:20:32.113 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:84%
-But isn't that the whole key?
-Exactly.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And nature can
help that for sure.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But as I said,
nobody's listening.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's lovely to
connect with nature.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember also,
I remember I only

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:90%
ever have one panic attack.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And we'd started a community.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I started a spiritual
community in which I lived in,

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:84%
which was really creating
in the classroom for myself.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
other people in there.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think I said yesterday
I didn't like them.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:90%
They didn't like me.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
I didn't like me.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
But I ran out of money.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting on the
bed one day in our caravan

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:84%
which Americans call a
trailer, but a caravan.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
my god, you know,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I have four children and
a wife and I have $200.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
That's all I have,
absolutely nothing else.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was really getting
very, very anxious

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and sort of sweating.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And I thought this is terrible.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And the door opened and
my late wife came in.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me, do you
know how much money we've got?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And foolishly, I said, no.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:90%
And she said, $4.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And she walked down
and shut the door.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:84%
She said she didn't slam it,
but she shut it very forcefully.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And do you know, I was
so humiliated, in my 40s.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I was so humiliated, so ashamed
of myself and so terrified

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
by this, I was sitting on
the bed and passed out.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I just passed out.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.850 align:middle line:84%
I realized that prior
to her coming in,

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd only been practicing
for a panic attack.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
So then I had a real one.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I came around,
you know what happened?

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I still only had $4.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
But I realized I
could never ever

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:90%
be more frightened than that.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And having literally
passed out from fear,

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
it's as though I looked
at fear and thought,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.310 align:middle line:84%
God, you're a bit of a
toothless tiger, aren't you?

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:17.931 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's so
I've only got $4.

00:22:17.931 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%
So what?
We can manage.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:90%
We'll get through this.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, my
whole attitude changed.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:25.862 align:middle line:90%
And this is what abundance is.

00:22:25.862 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Abundance is a shift
in consciousness.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like I mentioned, every
time we look in a window

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and say, I can't
afford, we feed poverty.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But every time-- and this
is where nature comes in,

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
when you look at nature
and you realize that it

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go out window shopping.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't go
out looking for food.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Squirrels and many of the
animals go looking for food.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
But so much of nature
stands passively there

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:90%
and food comes to it.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the predators, ambush
predators, food comes to it.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Some of them hunt.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But nature doesn't ever look a
life-- nothing in nature looks

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:90%
at life as lack.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:90%
We have a big focus on lack.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
focus on abundance.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
focus on abundance

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and you think from abundance,
and you feel from abundance,

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's really important.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You feel abundance.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, that moves into
your consciousness.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But I suspect sometimes we
need to reach that point

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
issue of terror of not having
enough to realize finally,

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:90%
I created this.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough
because I always

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
focus on not having enough.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.460 align:middle line:84%
It feels to me like the
certain world needs to collapse.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And then there is pain and
suffering but our own world.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, there
is this huge fear and panic.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And how am I going to do this?

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's suffering so deep,
that you just have to-- I mean

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember myself
being on my knees

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and praying and asking
for another answer.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I've never found myself
in the situation before.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was so much--
it was just unbearable.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And at some point it's like,
there is this crossover.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.390 align:middle line:84%
There is this little-- how
would you call this step

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
from the suffering and
this pain and this locked

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:84%
in world to one that is
expanded and unites everything?

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.230 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting question.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know there is
a name for that state,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
shifting consciousness.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to get to
that desperate point, which

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:26.810 align:middle line:90%
everybody avoids.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But then, that place
is a knife edge.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:90%
And one edge one way is suicide.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And the other way is back
in to life with more power

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever had.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the suicide
rates in every country

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.290 align:middle line:84%
are escalating at
an incredible speed.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
suddenly find life

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:84%
in that incredible moment,
which we create, we manufacture.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's as though,
really, energy,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.395 align:middle line:90%
where you focus energy flows.

00:24:58.395 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And when you're on that
razor edge, of everything's

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
gone wrong, you're broke.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:90%
You're frightened.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
clues is when you

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.880 align:middle line:84%
can actually admit that to
yourself, when you can say,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I have no money.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where to go.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to handle this.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can honestly accept
and acknowledge all the fears,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly when
you've said them all,

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't quite seem so bad.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean when I was a
farmer in Tasmania,

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
we went through the worst decade
of farming in the 20th century.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We arrived, emigrated, just
for the beginning of it,

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:90%
like as if I needed that.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:90%
But I did need that.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:90%
I got there in perfect timing.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:90%
We went into drought.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
First, we had a
caterpillar plague.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't imagine it.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Locusts, you know
what they're like.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Locusts, they're
big grasshoppers,

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:90%
flying grasshoppers.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, a locust plague
strips everything.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, so does a caterpillar
plague, except they don't fly.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:01.180 align:middle line:90%
They crawl through your house.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to grease band
the house to keep them out.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't imagine.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
You're hens, chickens,
they eat the caterpillars

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:90%
and lay green eggs.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:90%
You can't eat the eggs.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, they go across your
farm and they strip it.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing left.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Everything's gone that's green.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It's brown.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And the cows were dying.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.925 align:middle line:90%
And then we went into drought.

00:26:21.925 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And the drought went
on year after year.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:90%
That lasted three years.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Then we went into an economic
recession in agriculture.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
In the cities,
everything was booming.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:84%
In agricultural,
prices of [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:40.820 align:middle line:90%
went from $350 to $5.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And farmers were
suiciding everywhere.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And one day, we were desperate.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:84%
This was my late wife
and I, we were desperate.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we went up onto the
highest hills of our farm

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and we said, what have we got?

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:90%
We've got four lovely children.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:90%
We've got each other.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:90%
We've got love.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:59.430 align:middle line:84%
We've got a beautiful
farm, even if we

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.050 align:middle line:90%
don't particularly own it.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.380 align:middle line:90%
We've got a lovely environment.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
We've got the glorious
mountain up there.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And we went through all
the things that we've got.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we said, so
what don't we have?

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Money.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, changed
the whole perspective.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a great mountain
of what we did have

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and one thing that was missing.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And what did we focus
on all the time?

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Lack of money.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.360 align:middle line:90%
What an illusion.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a truth and
yet it is an illusion.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we focus on lack and
where you focus, energy flows.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:90%
And so it could never break.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So we began to focus
on what we had.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
We began to focus on the
muchness of our life,

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
the abundance in
our life, and that

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:90%
began to change everything.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, it all got
better and better and better.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just because that
the situation farming didn't

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:84%
improve for a long
time, but it's

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
because our focus had shifted.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
principles to remember in life

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.140 align:middle line:84%
is, where you
focus, energy flows.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And the energy is
your own energy.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's your life
and it's your energy.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But I hear that you
also really let it

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
in, like through
gratitude, you were

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.420 align:middle line:90%
able to open up the hearts.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like the abundance,
the hearts, and our love,

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%
all that is connected.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And once you start to let
it in, and then let fear go,

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.180 align:middle line:84%
there's this part
that starts inside

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps on
growing from there.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:90%
But we have to let it in now.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the big thing.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
The time we're in now, not only
is it easier to let in, I mean,

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely imperative
to let it in now,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
to open, to open to
life, to open to love,

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:90%
to open to gratitude, to focus.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to stop
thinking, to open

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
to thinking thoughts of
gratitude and appreciation

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:90%
and self-respect.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So many thoughts that people
have, over 80% are negative.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's 60,000.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
That creates a direction,
and that's the direction

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.760 align:middle line:90%
of that person's life.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And particularly now,
because at the moment where

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.670 align:middle line:84%
we're in a three
dimensional reality.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving into
a dimensional shift,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:90%
shall we say.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Basically this means
everybody is polarizing.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And the polarity is-- I mean,
the North Pole is shifting up

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to about 45 kilometers
a year, and everything

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is-- we're in a world of
change, metamorphosis.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come out of
this like little butterflies

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%
or little caterpillars.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And caterpillars don't fly.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're happening, we're
becoming either more deeply

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.020 align:middle line:84%
embedded in the three
dimensional reality

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
through negative thinking,
I want, I want, et cetera.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Or we're embedding more deeply
in three dimensional reality.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Or we are moving into
thoughts of gratitude

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of gratitude,
feelings of appreciation.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we're moving into a
fourth dimensional reality.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts
and those feelings

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
will begin to change us in
very subtle but definite ways.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.280 align:middle line:84%
They'll be molecular
changes take place.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The cells of the body become
more resilient, more flexible.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:84%
The DNA have taken a message
of appreciation and respect

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:90%
into the world around us.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And the world around
us is feeding us back

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.275 align:middle line:90%
exactly what we're putting out.

00:30:24.275 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:90%
And so changes take place.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get a shift
in energy really takes place,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
then there's a fifth
dimensional potential there.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And there is a possibility
that this planet

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.620 align:middle line:84%
could see the greatest
ascension there

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%
has ever been in humanity.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.555 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
ascension, I don't

00:30:45.555 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
mean it in a religious sense.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by ascension
is, as the energy changes

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that we're living in, and
we're all living on the same

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.630 align:middle line:90%
in the same frame of reality.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But one part is becoming
more deeply embedded.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect is moving
into the fourth dimension.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect as
well through that,

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:13.110 align:middle line:84%
ready for a higher
energetic shift,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:90%
which is another dimension.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Because dimensions
are consciousness.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you could-- let's
just say there was a tsunami

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's sweeping
through a city.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you scream and run to
the north, which would be very

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
powerful urge to do that,
you've joined mass consciousness

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and you probably
going to incarnate

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:90%
back as a hunter gatherer.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that,
which is rather nice.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Their energy is so much
cleaner than ours is now.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.571 align:middle line:84%
There's no lost of saved
or good or bad or right

00:31:41.571 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:90%
or wrong in this.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
direction we choose.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:84%
But equally, instead of
running from that tsunami,

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:90%
you decide, OK, this is it.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.240 align:middle line:90%
This is where I choose love.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I've spent too
many lives running.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you walk
towards the tsunami.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.786 align:middle line:84%
Now, sure there's hills nearby
and you could walk up them.

00:31:59.786 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:90%
That's sensible.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:90%
But there's no hills.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
You're shut in this town and
the tsunami's 200 meters high.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way out,
so you walk toward it.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:90%
You can be frightened.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to use the
courage to go beyond your fear.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:84%
You walk toward it and you
realize, I choose love.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I choose truth.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth?

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I am an immortal, magnificent,
metaphysical, multidimensional

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:90%
being of love and light.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:90%
That is my truth.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:90%
This is who I am.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm no longer going to
play the game of being a body.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.350 align:middle line:90%
And you walk toward it.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, before
the water reaches you,

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:90%
two things could happen.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.840 align:middle line:84%
One, it reaches you
and smashes your body,

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're instantly
in the fifth dimension.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And you say, wow,
that was a good trade.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Or as it comes
toward you, your body

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
seems to dissolve into
light and every cell

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.570 align:middle line:84%
follows the direction
of your consciousness.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And you simply take your
body to a higher dimension.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that probability
is there very strongly.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.970 align:middle line:90%
That sorts out.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.210 align:middle line:84%
That could only happen
if for millennia

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
your direction has
been toward compassion

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.290 align:middle line:90%
and courage and love.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes
an enormous amount

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:90%
of courage to be who you are.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
It's so easy to be
like other people are

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to join herd, the throng,
to say their things,

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:90%
to echo their sentiments.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The world's all gone wrong and
everything's bad and terrible.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a caterpillar,
it goes into metamorphosis.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Death joins in that cocoon.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And death takes away
the caterpillar.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But the same proteins
are left and life

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.850 align:middle line:84%
reweaves those proteins into a
completely different creature,

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
which comes out, stretches
the buds of its wings,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:84%
gradually unfolds them,
they dry in the sun

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and a flutterby flies away.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And the flutterby flies
and caterpillars crawl.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.670 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly where we're at.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether we fly with
light or whether we

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
go back to the stage of walking
on our legs and doing it again.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:90%
That's not wrong or bad.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just the direction of
our millenias of incarnations.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.179 align:middle line:90%
So let's choose it fully.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's choose it
100%, not halfway to.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:90%
This is what we don't do.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
We don't live life fully
with passion and love.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
People-- let's
not make a ripple.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's not have
anybody look at us.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the great fears
of humanity is public speaking.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's because there's
a fear of rejection.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And another even greater
one, the fear of ridicule.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:84%
And the time I think
of Louis the 16th,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:90%
ridicule was a weapon.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And they used it very savagely,
to ridicule each other

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:90%
to the point of death.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's still those
fears are with us now.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And yet what is it?

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Why are we afraid
to speak in public?

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Simply because we
lack self-confidence.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.250 align:middle line:84%
How can you have
confidence if every day

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.050 align:middle line:84%
you're spending three
quarters of the day

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:90%
criticizing yourself?

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exactly
create confidence.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And some people
can speak in public

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
and still criticize themselves.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But we take away
from what we are.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I like to often
to look at the fact

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that every animal lives
seven times the development

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.530 align:middle line:90%
of his physical body.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We take 20 years to
develop a physical body.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Seven twenties are 140,
not too many around.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Because nothing in
nature talks to itself.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't criticize itself.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:90%
It lives in the moment.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're never in the moment,
which takes away our energy.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're criticizing
ourselves constantly,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.010 align:middle line:90%
which takes away our energy.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So we've found a way
of living that reduces

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:90%
us and takes away our energy.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we've created a
society to support this.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.280 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have hospitals
full up with people who

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:84%
are dying because all
their life they've

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:84%
been reducing their own energy,
to the point of disease,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:90%
which is out of harmony.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And disconnected from
everything that is.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So we need to regrow
back our roots

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.751 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect to the field
and to everybody in this way

00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:90%
our universe can--

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And that way of nature
is the wonderful part,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:84%
because when you look
at nature, you realize

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:90%
everything is connected.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
In nature there's
no competition.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.135 align:middle line:84%
Now we look through the eyes
of competition, and say, ah,

00:36:25.135 --> 00:36:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I can see the competition
in the nature.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:90%
But it isn't there.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is
a reflection of us.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.920 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
is what we believe.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is
through our knowledge.

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is through
our intellect and our education

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't nature.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at an image we've
created of what nature is.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And nature is cooperation.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.220 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimensional
reality, they have sport,

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.990 align:middle line:90%
but there's no competition.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's noncompetitive sport.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Theirs is cooperative sport.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:37:00.050 align:middle line:84%
They cooperate and their
athletes far exceed ours.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
compete, you go against.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:90%
You cannot compete with.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You cooperate with.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.220 align:middle line:90%
You compete against.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And against is resistance.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's
yourself, whether it's

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.815 align:middle line:84%
your own time, whether it's
the clock, or other people,

00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:90%
it's always against.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
That reduces our final results.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.790 align:middle line:84%
--[INAUDIBLE], I
would like to end

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
this conversation
with your light

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.770 align:middle line:90%
body and your experiences.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you actually travel
multidimensionally and had

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:90%
those experiences or often do?

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So OK, every human
being is a magnificent,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.440 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical, multi-dimensional
being of love and light.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:90%
So let's call that a light body.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We have a light body,
a body of pure energy.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child, I was
in school, as I told you.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I found that if I
stared at the teacher,

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I could imagine
them getting smaller

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.820 align:middle line:90%
and smaller and smaller.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And as they got smaller,
their voice receded

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:90%
until they weren't there.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I would--
well, I'd leave them off

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.660 align:middle line:90%
at about the size of a fairy.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.830 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't hear them.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I would somehow
take myself away.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't understand it
and I called it daydreaming.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.580 align:middle line:84%
But I was really
aware, quite often

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that I came back
it was like a jolt.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I'd go, where have I been?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I was wide awake, completely
awake, aware of the teacher

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:17.750 align:middle line:90%
not being there and all that.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.980 align:middle line:84%
But when I came back-- so I
just put it down to daydreaming.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But when I got into my teens,
I forgot about all that.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I got into my '30s, I
was thinking about this and how

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.085 align:middle line:90%
I did it and what happened.

00:38:30.085 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to once
again look at that area.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
was that, yes, I

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:84%
could move my state
of consciousness

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:43.670 align:middle line:84%
away from identity and
physical and into this being

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:44.620 align:middle line:90%
of love and light.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I could
move and travel.

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'd travel into the world.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I'd travel into--

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
In my next book, I went
to visit three people.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.335 align:middle line:90%
I went into a hospital ward.

00:38:55.335 --> 00:38:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And one person, Henry, was
dying, terminal cancer.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And he was a real
devout Christian.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:90%
And another one was there, Jim.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And Jim was a complete atheist.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.280 align:middle line:90%
When you dead, that's the end.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
one who wasn't there, Ben.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a highly
developed spiritual person.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
at their death?

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I spend about two
years with each one of them

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.430 align:middle line:90%
in the process of death.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.150 align:middle line:90%
For me, that wasn't two minutes.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But for them, it would be
like two years passed by.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the Christian, the
atheist, and the spiritual,

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:84%
their experience after
death was completely

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.950 align:middle line:90%
and utterly different.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I find things
like that fascinating.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I find it fascinating
to sit cross-legged

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.360 align:middle line:90%
or in the Lotus position.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it physically, but
I love it metaphysically, about

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
100 meters or more above
New York or London,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.010 align:middle line:90%
haven't tried Paris.

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I just watch the people and
I see that people cluster.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I watch them moving, and
I watch their energy,

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:90%
their fields of energy.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And fields of energy cluster.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
If your body's sick and
they take a blood sample,

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.620 align:middle line:84%
they look to see if the
platelets of your blood

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.610 align:middle line:90%
stack or stick or cluster.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
sick, they cluster.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.490 align:middle line:84%
You look at a city,
people cluster.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Anger finds its
own energy and they

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:84%
walk among each
other in clusters,

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:90%
and they never even know it.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Boredom, you know, fear,
wanting, they all grow cluster.

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:30.010 align:middle line:90%
They cluster in the restaurants.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.300 align:middle line:90%
They cluster walking around.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.120 align:middle line:84%
They cluster in
shopping centers.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They leave one cluster
and join another.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:35.970 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Because none of them
know they're doing it.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:41.680 align:middle line:84%
But there was one person-- and I
mean, there are many in a city,

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
but there's one type of
person who does not cluster.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's the person
who is balanced,

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:52.340 align:middle line:84%
who has a beautiful
relationship with themselves.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying here
is, is your relationship

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, is your
relationship with life,

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:84%
when your relationship
with yourself

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
is one of love and appreciation
and respect for yourself,

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.470 align:middle line:90%
you do not cluster.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And you do not get the
diseases of clustering.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.930 align:middle line:84%
There's not a hospital on this
planet that has a ward or even

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:15.930 align:middle line:84%
a room for people to go in and
die who dying from terminal,

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.840 align:middle line:90%
unconditional love.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't go
to hospital to die.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Generally when
you're in that state,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:84%
you can just leave your body
when you feel is appropriate,

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.410 align:middle line:84%
or maybe not quite
appropriate, but you're

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
ready to leave it anyway
because there's no attachment.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, I spend a lot of time
traveling metaphysically,

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.110 align:middle line:90%
which is not astral.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Astral traveling is
when your body's asleep.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:90%
My body's wide awake.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I could do it walking
through a park.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I like to
move into trees.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:90%
So I'm walking along.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I generally come
to a standstill,

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.515 align:middle line:84%
because I walked into
a tree once physically

00:41:52.515 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and bounced off it
because I'd already

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.575 align:middle line:90%
walked into it metaphysically.

00:41:56.575 --> 00:41:58.740 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of forgot.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you can walk
into a tree and you can

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.160 align:middle line:90%
flow up the tree, up the trunk.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.760 align:middle line:84%
You can flow through
the branches.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.110 align:middle line:84%
You can flow out
into every leaf.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel the
sun on yourself as a leaf.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And you realize
that no human has

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.380 align:middle line:84%
ever connected with the sun the
way that a leaf on a tree does.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It feels it.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It hears it.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:90%
It smells it.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It knows the sun with
an incredible intimacy.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing
arrange of sounds.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And inside that leaf, you're
aware of the life forms

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:90%
of energy of photosynthesis.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
something else.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:84%
In every leaf, there are nature
spirits, myriads, millions.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And they take
sunlight as energy,

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.220 align:middle line:84%
as light energy, down
into the branches

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where a different
type of nature spirit

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.640 align:middle line:84%
takes them on down to the
surface of the ground.

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And another one
takes them on down,

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:90%
right down to the finest root.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.595 align:middle line:84%
And right at the tip of every
root , sunlight is there,

00:43:07.595 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that you couldn't
measure it or see

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.660 align:middle line:84%
it with the human eye or any
of our microscopes or anything.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But the actual energy of
sun and the light of the sun

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:84%
reaches every hair root where it
engages a profile of the soil.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Amazing, there is light deep
in the earth through the trees.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Nobody sees it and nobody
really cares, I guess.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Lots more than you think
are caring right now.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
is expanding fast.

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.911 align:middle line:84%
-You're not alone anymore.
-No, I know.

00:43:39.911 --> 00:43:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've wandered
through lifetimes as a mystic,

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and generally speaking truth.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But very, very used to being--
very familiar with suffering.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever listened to mystics.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And so many lives are
ended tortured on the rack,

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.030 align:middle line:84%
being pulled apart,
and screaming,

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.180 align:middle line:90%
your bowels open, terrible.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And this time I think that
fear of lifetimes of that

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.110 align:middle line:90%
was still there.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I feared being known in
the public for a long while.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a fear
that was in my face.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a fear that
was in the background

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
all the time, just keeping me
away from publicity, keeping me

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.180 align:middle line:90%
away from becoming well-known.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't want that.

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Too much pain went with that.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.010 align:middle line:84%
But when my late
wife passed away,

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd loved
her all my life.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I found I had,
48 years, of course

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:84%
there was the human
love as we know it,

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.590 align:middle line:84%
but there was so much
emotional attachment.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally let her go,
and I let emotional attachment

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.510 align:middle line:84%
go, and I knew when she said,
and she'd been gone a year,

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's in my book Through
the Eyes of Love, Book One.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And when she said, I
need you to let me goes.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
There was no, I'll see you
see when you come over.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:90%
I knew this is it.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:90%
51 years, and goodbye.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:90%
And I let go.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was not just a
physical or emotional thing.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:90%
There was a process.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I let go.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
she was gone and I

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.950 align:middle line:84%
moved to a higher
level of consciousness

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and found this
unconditional love.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what humanity
needs now, to love themselves

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.050 align:middle line:84%
without judging
who they are today,

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:29.070 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the person they
see in the mirror and the act

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and the pantomime of
their life is nothing

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.880 align:middle line:84%
more than an illusion, that
they are under all that,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:84%
this magnificent,
immortal, magnificent,

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical, multi-dimensional
being of love and light.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And the way to get there
is keep choosing love.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Keep choosing love.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Every time there's a
confrontation, choose love.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Every time somebody is angry
with you, smile at them.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Choose love every time you're
criticizing yourself, stop.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Choose love.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Every situation in
your life, choose love.

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:84%
That would have the
greatest transforming effect

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.760 align:middle line:90%
of anything.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Well thank you, Michael.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming back.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming out.
-My pleasure.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this moment.
Thank you.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.419 align:middle line:84%
It's perfect timing.
Thank you, Michael.

00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I won't even get tortured.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.760 align:middle line:90%
It will all be in love.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a lovely feeling.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:21.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful thing.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.760 align:middle line:84%
No, that fear has gone
completely, utterly gone.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But it was very real
for far too long.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us
can relate to that.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You're wonderful.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Much love, my
beautiful co-creators,

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.340 align:middle line:90%
from South of France.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.334 align:middle line:90%
