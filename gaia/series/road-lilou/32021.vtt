[ Music ]

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:11.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my
Juicy co-creators.

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.415 align:middle line:90%
I'm in London today.

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:19.053 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road to do another
juicy interview with you,

00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:20.488 align:middle line:90%
Anthony, I'm so excited.

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:22.523 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
here, coming.

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:23.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Peake: Thank
you for inviting me

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:27.027 align:middle line:84%
to this beautiful place, very
lovely, really beautiful.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you are welcome,
I'm excited, I love speaking

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.466 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of
out of body experience.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.735 align:middle line:90%
We're going to speak of deja vu.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.203 align:middle line:90%
French name, huh?

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:39.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Peake: Absolutely,
for already seen, isn't it?

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:41.008 align:middle line:90%
Effectively.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle line:84%
We might have done
this before, you know.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It might
be quite possible.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.414 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to getting
to those conversations.

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.616 align:middle line:90%
You wrote many books.

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:52.019 align:middle line:84%
They have been translated
in other languages too.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.988 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us briefly
the different titles

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:84%
so we can really clearly see
'cause I know it deals with life

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.626 align:middle line:90%
after death and many others.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.494 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Peake: The first book
is "Is There Life After Death?"

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary signs of
what happens when you die

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.832 align:middle line:90%
which was published in 2006.

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.968 align:middle line:84%
That book has now sold
probably approaching 40,000

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:90%
copies worldwide.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.107 align:middle line:84%
It's been translated into
Russian, Dutch, Spanish,

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.742 align:middle line:90%
various other languages as well.

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:17.478 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, the second book
was then called "The Daemon,

00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
A Guide to Your Extraordinary
Secret Self"

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.682 align:middle line:84%
which discusses the
idea of human duality,

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.551 align:middle line:90%
the idea of do we have two foci

00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.819 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
within the brain.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.022 align:middle line:84%
The third book is then "The
Out-of-Body Experience"

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
which is my scientific take
on exactly what happens

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.197 align:middle line:84%
when people feel that they
move outside of their body.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:39.366 align:middle line:84%
I've then written a book on time
called "The Labyrinth of Time"

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the science of
the consciousness of time,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
how we perceive time, does
time flow, can time speed up

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.375 align:middle line:90%
or slow down, is time circular.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:53.247 align:middle line:84%
I've then written a book,
I co-written a book,

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
so I say co-written but
actually co-edited a book

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.787 align:middle line:84%
with two Australian
consultant psychiatrists

00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:01.822 align:middle line:84%
on the near death experience
called "Making Sense

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:05.559 align:middle line:84%
of Near-Death Experience" which
funny enough was nominated

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.194 align:middle line:84%
for the Psychiatric
Book of the Year

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.396 align:middle line:84%
of the British Medical
Association last year,

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.699 align:middle line:84%
and we still ended up
being highly commended.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.335 align:middle line:84%
So clearly this work has
very much been registered

00:02:14.335 --> 00:02:18.906 align:middle line:84%
by serious workers and
serious scientists.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.675 align:middle line:84%
I then wrote and at the
moment I'm in the process

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.746 align:middle line:84%
of writing two books and I've
just finished a book called

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:30.084 align:middle line:84%
"The Infinite Mindfield" which
is dealing with consciousness

00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:84%
in the way consciousness
can sometimes

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.723 align:middle line:84%
under certain circumstances
perceive alternative realities.

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:38.324 align:middle line:84%
And I'm particularly
interested in the idea

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.861 align:middle line:84%
of when we dream,
where do we go.

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.496 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is the
reality there?

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.733 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people take
hallucinogenic substances

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.302 align:middle line:84%
like dimethyltryptamine
and such like?

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:50.304 align:middle line:90%
And I'm working closely there

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:52.406 align:middle line:84%
with a guy called
Professor Ervin Laszlo

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.408 align:middle line:90%
who is a Hungarian--

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:55.442 align:middle line:90%
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.344 align:middle line:90%
So you know Ervin, all right.

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.445 align:middle line:90%
Well [inaudible] to know.

00:02:58.445 --> 00:02:59.647 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Beautiful
heart and genius and--

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:00.714 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: He's a wonderful guy.

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:02.149 align:middle line:90%
I mean I was really honored.

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.084 align:middle line:84%
Recently he contacted
me to say he wanted

00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:05.653 align:middle line:90%
to write a book with me.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.455 align:middle line:84%
And indeed we have just
started, myself and Ervin,

00:03:08.455 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:84%
writing this new book
which will be the evidence

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.794 align:middle line:84%
for consciousness existing
outside of the brain.

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:16.764 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing one side of the book
and Ervin is writing the other.

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:19.366 align:middle line:84%
And that will be published
probably about 18 months' time

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.402 align:middle line:84%
by Inner Traditions
in the states.

00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:25.906 align:middle line:84%
But on top of that, I just
finished writing a biography

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:28.942 align:middle line:84%
of the American science
fiction writer Philip K. Dick

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:32.646 align:middle line:84%
because in my ideas very much
Philip K. Dick reflects an

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:35.416 align:middle line:84%
awful-- he'd lived an awful
lot of the things I discussed

00:03:35.416 --> 00:03:36.517 align:middle line:90%
in my books [inaudible].

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:38.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The films--
his films were put--

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.487 align:middle line:90%
his books were put into films?

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.455 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Yes, very much so.

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.523 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:43.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can you
mention couple because--

00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.258 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Yeah.

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:47.261 align:middle line:84%
"Minority Report" is an
example, "Total Recall"

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.064 align:middle line:84%
and of course the
classic "Blade Runner".

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:53.334 align:middle line:84%
And all of these films are
based upon these most iconic

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:54.968 align:middle line:90%
of science fiction writers.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:58.872 align:middle line:84%
And Philip K. Dick was a
profoundly unusual character

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:02.443 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that his fiction
very much described his life.

00:04:02.443 --> 00:04:05.012 align:middle line:84%
I mean he was fascinated by
precognitions for instance.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:07.815 align:middle line:84%
And indeed in my book I
actually called it "The Man

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:10.517 align:middle line:84%
Who Remembered the Future"
because I cite example

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
after example of Philip K. Dick
actually being what he turned,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.621 align:middle line:90%
a precog.

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.656 align:middle line:84%
And this book very much
deals with those elements.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:18.726 align:middle line:84%
This book will be
due out probably

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:90%
in November or December.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.296 align:middle line:90%
So towards the end of this year,

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:24.498 align:middle line:84%
I have two books
coming out and--

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:26.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: We have so
much to talk about.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:26.834 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: We certainly do.

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:27.568 align:middle line:90%
We certainly do.

00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:28.936 align:middle line:90%
It's where to start.

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:30.637 align:middle line:84%
And it's always the case with
my work is where do we start

00:04:30.637 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and where do we go with
it because it's very wide

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.041 align:middle line:84%
and it's very deep
in what I deal with.

00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.181 align:middle line:84%
I hear that you have a theory
and I would love you to talk

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.449 align:middle line:84%
about those clues
like [inaudible].

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.452 align:middle line:84%
How did this-- all these
started first of all?

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.254 align:middle line:84%
How-- when did you get
into this because you seem

00:04:47.254 --> 00:04:51.492 align:middle line:84%
to have really plunged and
got really deep into it.

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:55.963 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: I suppose-- well, it's
really quite a curious story.

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:57.498 align:middle line:84%
I work as a management
consultant.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:59.099 align:middle line:90%
This is my normal living

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and what I do is I assist
companies in various ways.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.938 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in
the circumstances

00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:08.208 align:middle line:84%
where I've done a fairly
reasonable contract and I was

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:11.545 align:middle line:84%
in the position but I could take
some timeout to write a book,

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'd always wanted
to write a book,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.681 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know what
I wanted to write about.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.716 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one
of these things,

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:16.717 align:middle line:84%
it's one of these
urges we always have

00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:18.585 align:middle line:90%
with fiction, nonfiction.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:21.021 align:middle line:84%
And my wife agreed
and we said we--

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.757 align:middle line:84%
I take literally one
year out, you know.

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And on the first day, I'm
sitting there in front

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.629 align:middle line:84%
of a blank computer
screen going,

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:84%
"What am I going
to write about?"

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.698 align:middle line:84%
And literally it was like
that and I was going, "Fine,

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:33.033 align:middle line:90%
where do I start here?"

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
As I was doing so, I started
feeling a tingling sensation

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.041 align:middle line:84%
in my lips and the end of my
finger starts to feel numb.

00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.477 align:middle line:84%
Now I realized exactly what was
happening because it happens

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:45.312 align:middle line:90%
to me two or three times a year.

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:48.715 align:middle line:84%
I was having what's
called a pre-migraine aura.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.318 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of a sensation
you have before indeed

00:05:51.318 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:90%
if you have the full headache.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.123 align:middle line:84%
But it's a kind of a
pre-warning of the fact,

00:05:56.123 --> 00:05:58.325 align:middle line:90%
it's a neurological aspect.

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:01.628 align:middle line:84%
And as I was feeling
quite strange,

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:05.399 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly have the
most profound sensation

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:08.702 align:middle line:84%
that I had sat in front
of that computer screen

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.505 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same
circumstances in my home.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:14.208 align:middle line:84%
We were then living in
Horsham in West Sussex.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:17.511 align:middle line:84%
Looking out of that
window at the view

00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and the sensation
was overpowering.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a sensation of
absolute recognition.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.551 align:middle line:84%
Now of course I recognized
the phenomena

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.087 align:middle line:84%
as being what I would
then call deja vu.

00:06:27.087 --> 00:06:29.523 align:middle line:84%
But when I actually came
out of the aura state,

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:31.859 align:middle line:84%
I realized that's
what I needed to write

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:33.227 align:middle line:90%
about because I thought,

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.329 align:middle line:84%
"I wonder if there's been any
books written about deja vu.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:38.332 align:middle line:84%
Exactly what is deja vu, what
is the neurological explanation

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:39.565 align:middle line:90%
for déjà vu?"

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:42.536 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading up
about the subject and I came

00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:44.972 align:middle line:84%
across a fascinating
paper written

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:84%
by a guy called Dr.
Arthur Funkhouser

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.475 align:middle line:90%
who is now a friend of mine.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.278 align:middle line:84%
He is an American that's
based in Bern in Switzerland.

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:54.648 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book called
"The dream theory of deja vu".

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:58.752 align:middle line:84%
And in this paper, Art suggests
that a deja vu sensation

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.622 align:middle line:84%
or as he calls it a deja
vecu sensation, you know,

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.124 align:middle line:90%
already lived, his argument is

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:09.796 align:middle line:84%
that you have had a dream
recently and in the dream,

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:11.865 align:middle line:84%
there's been certain
events taken place.

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have a
dream and you wake up,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.302 align:middle line:84%
you remember the dream for a
few seconds then you forget it.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:18.005 align:middle line:84%
But what tends to happen
is the dream remains

00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.243 align:middle line:84%
And what he claims happens
is that you then start

00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:26.313 align:middle line:84%
to live the dream,
what you dreamt starts

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:27.648 align:middle line:90%
to happen in real life.

00:07:27.648 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have this curios
recognition that you don't know

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.688 align:middle line:84%
where from because
the actual definition

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.024 align:middle line:84%
of the deja vu sensation
was put forth

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:41.662 align:middle line:84%
by a guy called Vernon Neppe
who's a psychiatrist in Seattle.

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:44.898 align:middle line:84%
And Neppe basically says,
it's this kind of feeling

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:49.536 align:middle line:84%
of a recognition, of a memory of
something in an indistinct part

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:52.139 align:middle line:84%
of your past because that's
exactly what a deja vu sensation

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:90%
is, isn't it?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.642 align:middle line:84%
It's "have I done this before
or have I lived this before?"

00:07:56.642 --> 00:08:00.213 align:middle line:84%
So I started reading up about it
and reading about the neurology

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:02.816 align:middle line:84%
and I found that
much to my surprise,

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.685 align:middle line:84%
there are neurological
explanation for this,

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:08.455 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most
famous ones is the visual

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:90%
pathways hypothesis.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.125 align:middle line:84%
And this basically was
put forward in 1962

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.328 align:middle line:90%
by a guy called Robert Efron.

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:17.531 align:middle line:84%
And Efron suggested that
effectively we have a right

00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:21.768 align:middle line:84%
and left hemisphere, OK, and
they function quite separately.

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.972 align:middle line:84%
Each of the hemispheres are fed
from the different visual fields

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:28.508 align:middle line:84%
of the eyes, so both
hemispheres have stereovision.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.744 align:middle line:84%
And he argues that what
tends to happen is,

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:33.046 align:middle line:84%
is that a signal is
processed initially

00:08:33.046 --> 00:08:35.048 align:middle line:84%
by the non-dominant
hemisphere and it is seen

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:36.617 align:middle line:90%
by the non-dominant hemisphere.

00:08:36.617 --> 00:08:39.118 align:middle line:84%
And that message then goes
across the corpus callosum

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.554 align:middle line:84%
which is the communication
channel

00:08:40.554 --> 00:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
between the two sides
of the brain.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:43.957 align:middle line:84%
And then it's fed into
the dominant hemisphere

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.359 align:middle line:90%
where we live.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:48.629 align:middle line:84%
So what happen is you see some--
you subconsciously see something

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:49.997 align:middle line:84%
from your non-dominant
hemisphere,

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.131 align:middle line:90%
then you see it in reality.

00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:53.367 align:middle line:90%
So it's this kind of recognition

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.701 align:middle line:84%
that you've seen
something before.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.004 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
Efron hypothesis is

00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.406 align:middle line:90%
that it's 0.05 of a second.

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:01.708 align:middle line:84%
Now when I have deja vu
sensations and I don't know

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.945 align:middle line:84%
about you but it's
an overall feeling

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.313 align:middle line:90%
that I have lived this before.

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:09.082 align:middle line:84%
You know I-- it's me
standing in these clothes,

00:09:09.082 --> 00:09:10.384 align:middle line:90%
having this conversation now

00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:84%
and I've done it before
sometime in my past.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:13.186 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And that's
what we say,

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.454 align:middle line:84%
that's what comes
out of our mouth.

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:15.322 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Yes, exactly.

00:09:15.322 --> 00:09:16.256 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I've already
seen this?

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.358 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: Yeah, I've
already seen it.

00:09:18.358 --> 00:09:20.293 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is the
profound thing whereas 0.05

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.729 align:middle line:84%
of a second would be
such a short delay.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.531 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have
the time to do that.

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:27.534 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly enough,
there's been a series

00:09:27.534 --> 00:09:30.404 align:middle line:84%
of experiments done at the
University of Leeds over here

00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:33.907 align:middle line:84%
in the UK by a guy called
Chris Moulin who's professor

00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.943 align:middle line:84%
of psychology up
there and an associate

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:84%
of his called Akira O'Connor
and they have discovered

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:44.017 align:middle line:84%
that children who are
born blind have deja--

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:46.486 align:middle line:84%
is it deja senti you would call
it [inaudible] already heard?

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Deja senti.

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:48.655 align:middle line:90%
No, senti is the smell.

00:09:48.655 --> 00:09:49.923 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Smell.

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:54.561 align:middle line:84%
So it's all-- but it's
already heard then, OK.

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Deja entendu.

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:57.364 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Entendu, that's it.

00:09:57.364 --> 00:10:01.902 align:middle line:84%
And deaf-- blind people who
are born blind have the--

00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.271 align:middle line:84%
they hear something
and they hear it again.

00:10:04.271 --> 00:10:08.275 align:middle line:84%
Now the actual-- the way in
which the brain functions,

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.378 align:middle line:84%
it works [inaudible] the Efron
hypothesis but it doesn't work

00:10:11.378 --> 00:10:13.480 align:middle line:90%
for sound and hearing.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.916 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore the whole
concept is out of the window.

00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:18.719 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore we're
then back to the point

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:20.854 align:middle line:84%
of exactly what a
deja vu sensation is.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:24.024 align:middle line:84%
And effective is-- cut a long
story short, what I found was,

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.826 align:middle line:84%
was the neurological
aspects that bring

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.228 align:middle line:90%
about my deja vu sensation

00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:32.866 align:middle line:84%
when I was having the
migraine aura is linked

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:35.802 align:middle line:84%
to certain neurochemicals in
the brain because it's part

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:38.438 align:middle line:84%
of if you have migraine, if
you read books on migraine,

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the symptoms
they will say is

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.541 align:middle line:84%
that you have deja
vu sensations.

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:44.277 align:middle line:84%
But what I also found was
that there is another group

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:47.314 align:middle line:84%
of individuals that have
profound deja vu sensations

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.783 align:middle line:84%
and these are people that
have what is called temporal

00:10:49.783 --> 00:10:51.385 align:middle line:90%
lobe epilepsy.

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:54.154 align:middle line:84%
And temporal lobe epilepsy
is a form of epilepsy focused

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.622 align:middle line:84%
on the temporal lobes
which are the areas

00:10:55.622 --> 00:10:59.059 align:middle line:84%
around the ears effectively
on each side.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.929 align:middle line:84%
And these individuals have
deja vu sensations to kill for.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.998 align:middle line:84%
They have deja vu sensations
where they know what's going

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.868 align:middle line:84%
to be happening for the
next two or three seconds.

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:11.438 align:middle line:84%
I did a radio program on BBC
Radio Merseyside a few years ago

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:14.207 align:middle line:84%
and a man phoned
up and he had had

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:17.077 align:middle line:84%
such a profound deja vu
sensation that he was able

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:20.881 align:middle line:84%
to write down on a piece of
paper what he knew his wife was

00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:23.049 align:middle line:84%
about to say to him and he
wrote it down on a piece

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:24.451 align:middle line:90%
of paper and handed it to her.

00:11:24.451 --> 00:11:26.653 align:middle line:84%
She then said something and
she opened the piece of paper

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.289 align:middle line:84%
and what he'd written
was what she said.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:32.926 align:middle line:84%
I have another associate
of mine who has a tumor

00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.662 align:middle line:84%
on his pineal gland in his brain
'cause another area I deal was

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland
which I'll be writing

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.932 align:middle line:90%
about on my next feature books.

00:11:38.932 --> 00:11:43.136 align:middle line:84%
And in that, he tells me that
he knows what's going to happen

00:11:43.136 --> 00:11:45.806 align:middle line:90%
for the next minute or so.

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:49.776 align:middle line:84%
And now again, this guy is
literally a rocket scientist.

00:11:49.776 --> 00:11:52.779 align:middle line:84%
He's doing his PhD in
rocket science, you know,

00:11:52.779 --> 00:11:54.581 align:middle line:84%
so he's a highly
intelligent guy.

00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him and I said,
"If you know what's going

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.553 align:middle line:84%
to happen next, why
don't you just say so?

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.621 align:middle line:84%
If you know what I'm going to
say now, why don't you say,

00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:02.889 align:middle line:84%
'I know what you're
going to say now'?"

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.825 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "I can't.

00:12:04.825 --> 00:12:07.861 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I can't is if I
did that you wouldn't say it.

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.863 align:middle line:84%
You'd say something different,
you'd react differently."

00:12:09.863 --> 00:12:12.799 align:middle line:84%
And I see, he said to me, it'd
really be changing the future.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.101 align:middle line:90%
So, I started looking into this

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and I thought what's
the linkage here.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.505 align:middle line:84%
And I found there's a
certain neurochemical

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.941 align:middle line:84%
in the brain are
called glutamate,

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.243 align:middle line:84%
and glutamate is very, very
active in the mammalian brain

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:26.947 align:middle line:84%
and it's also active
in the temporal lobes.

00:12:26.947 --> 00:12:30.183 align:middle line:84%
But I also found glutamate
is also a substance

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:32.853 align:middle line:84%
that is involved
in another very,

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:36.189 align:middle line:84%
very peculiar phenomenon known
as near-death experience.

00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:38.725 align:middle line:84%
Because at the point of death,
people turn around and they say

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:41.461 align:middle line:84%
that they see their life
flashing before their eyes.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:45.131 align:middle line:84%
They float about to their body,
they have various sensations.

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:47.133 align:middle line:84%
So, I started looking up in
the near-death experience

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:84%
and I thought there
is a linkage here

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:51.905 align:middle line:84%
between temporal lobe epilepsy,
near-death experience, migraine,

00:12:51.905 --> 00:12:55.842 align:middle line:84%
possibly also bipolar
and possibly an autism.

00:12:55.842 --> 00:13:00.146 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a definite spectrum
here and it's all linked

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:01.481 align:middle line:90%
to near-death experience.

00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:03.416 align:middle line:90%
And that's then I thought, well,

00:13:03.416 --> 00:13:06.786 align:middle line:84%
this idea of my life
flashing before my eyes,

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:08.355 align:middle line:90%
what does this mean?

00:13:08.355 --> 00:13:11.258 align:middle line:84%
So, then I started
looking into the concept

00:13:11.258 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:90%
of memory and how memory works.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.564 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered much to my
surprise that there is very,

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:21.935 align:middle line:84%
very strong evidence that the
brain lays down the memories

00:13:21.935 --> 00:13:24.537 align:middle line:84%
of every single thing
we experience.

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:27.707 align:middle line:84%
It's all encoded in the brain,
possibly holographically

00:13:27.707 --> 00:13:29.409 align:middle line:84%
which means that every
experience you have

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:31.311 align:middle line:84%
in your life, from the moment
of your birth to the moment

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.548 align:middle line:84%
of your death is already
encoded in the brain.

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.182 align:middle line:90%
It's there available.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.652 align:middle line:84%
This is why sometimes we
have charged memories.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.587 align:middle line:84%
You know, probably you
have them, I have them.

00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:42.055 align:middle line:84%
And charged memories
are memories you have

00:13:42.055 --> 00:13:44.724 align:middle line:84%
of your childhood where
there's an incident

00:13:44.724 --> 00:13:48.595 align:middle line:84%
and you can remember
it with absolute vivid

00:13:48.595 --> 00:13:50.797 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know why because
it's probably just a very

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:52.132 align:middle line:90%
mundane event.

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:54.034 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the big events in your
life [inaudible] you don't

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.368 align:middle line:90%
necessarily remember.

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's as if there's a
process of recording

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.341 align:middle line:84%
where the recording mechanism is
super saturated for that point

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.609 align:middle line:90%
and it's so vivid to you.

00:14:02.609 --> 00:14:06.513 align:middle line:84%
So, there you have the
scenario of these memories.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:11.885 align:middle line:84%
Now again there was work
done in the 1940s and 1950s

00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:17.157 align:middle line:84%
by a guy called Wilder Penfield,
who's a Canadian neurosurgeon

00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:19.759 align:middle line:84%
and he used to stimulate
the exposed brain

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:21.027 align:middle line:90%
of conscious patients.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:22.729 align:middle line:84%
There's a long story as
to why he used to do that

00:14:22.729 --> 00:14:25.498 align:middle line:84%
but we [inaudible] time to
go into it at the moment.

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.168 align:middle line:84%
But effectively he discovered
by placing an electrode

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:31.237 align:middle line:84%
onto the exposed parts of the
brain of the conscious patients,

00:14:31.237 --> 00:14:35.642 align:middle line:84%
he was able to have that patient
elicit past life memories,

00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:37.143 align:middle line:90%
literally three dimensional.

00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:40.313 align:middle line:84%
They were there back living
a moment in their past.

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:42.983 align:middle line:84%
And Penfield towards the end of
his life said that he believed

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:45.185 align:middle line:84%
that we lay down
all these memories.

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine a scenario
at the point

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:51.523 align:middle line:84%
of death my life
flashes before my eyes.

00:14:51.523 --> 00:14:56.129 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that is in a
near-death experience,

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:57.831 align:middle line:90%
why is it fast forwarded?

00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:01.167 align:middle line:84%
It's as if somebody
metaphorically has pressed a

00:15:01.167 --> 00:15:02.635 align:middle line:90%
fast forward on a video,

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:04.671 align:middle line:84%
you know when you press fast
forward and it goes through.

00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:06.906 align:middle line:84%
'Cause people say they
see their whole life

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.209 align:middle line:90%
or snapshots of their life.

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.276 align:middle line:90%
What make--

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:12.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Not all see--
have premonitions.

00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:16.683 align:middle line:84%
Some-- most of them see actually
people that are already there.

00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: Yes, they will go back
to a past part of their life.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.089 align:middle line:84%
I have examples because since my
first book, people have written

00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:25.325 align:middle line:84%
to me from around the
world giving me examples

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.493 align:middle line:90%
of these experiences.

00:15:26.493 --> 00:15:28.061 align:middle line:90%
And they're phenomenally common

00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.463 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually called
a panoramic life review.

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:32.298 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a member of the
International Association

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.501 align:middle line:84%
of Near-Death Studies
which is an organization

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:35.902 align:middle line:90%
that studies this phenomenon.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.737 align:middle line:84%
And it is known as the
panoramic life review.

00:15:37.737 --> 00:15:38.671 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, you
would find the--

00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.941 align:middle line:84%
Eben Alexander that
I've interviewed back

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.576 align:middle line:90%
in France a few months ago,

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:46.479 align:middle line:84%
you must find his story very
fascinating for his brain

00:15:46.479 --> 00:15:48.448 align:middle line:84%
as a neurosurgeon
[phonetic] being totally off.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.317 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: Totally, fondly enough
Eben Alexander actually cites my

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:53.853 align:middle line:84%
first book in the
bibliography of this book.

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:90%
And I'm keen to talk

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.757 align:middle line:84%
to him 'cause there's quite a
few things that he discusses

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:00.593 align:middle line:84%
in his book that really
vindicate my own hypothesis,

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:03.296 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very keen and I'm
just delighted to see

00:16:03.296 --> 00:16:06.533 align:middle line:84%
that he actually acknowledges my
work as well which is wonderful

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:90%
to actually hear that.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
He's a beautiful man inside
out, like really he is very open

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.806 align:middle line:84%
and has that-- I love
that about people

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.741 align:middle line:84%
that had near-death
experience because they seem

00:16:14.741 --> 00:16:18.445 align:middle line:84%
to bring something, another
kind of energy and a perception

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:19.779 align:middle line:84%
and they can have
this intelligence.

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:21.347 align:middle line:84%
He's a brilliant
mind from Harvard

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:24.417 align:middle line:84%
at the same time having
this emotional open side

00:16:24.417 --> 00:16:26.719 align:middle line:84%
to infinity-- to
unconditional love.

00:16:26.719 --> 00:16:28.288 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: I think what happens
is it's because you've had

00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.824 align:middle line:90%
such a changing experience

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.059 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly the way
you perceive reality,

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.694 align:middle line:84%
I mean again it's
going off on a tangent.

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:38.298 align:middle line:84%
One of my major issues is the
materialist-reductionist world

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:84%
view and the idea that
because it cannot be quantified

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.805 align:middle line:84%
scientifically therefore
it doesn't exist.

00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
My argument is always
that, well,

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.275 align:middle line:90%
consciousness can be quantified.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:52.545 align:middle line:84%
Neither can a self referential
consciousness in the brain.

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:56.516 align:middle line:84%
I mean science does not know how
inanimate matter in the brain,

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:58.017 align:middle line:84%
the jelly [phonetic]
with electrical impulses

00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.787 align:middle line:84%
in the brain generates
the concept of being,

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:02.455 align:middle line:90%
the concept of memories

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.389 align:middle line:84%
and anticipations
and everything else.

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:05.725 align:middle line:90%
So, that's the great mystery.

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:08.027 align:middle line:84%
It's actually known as the
heart problem of neuroscience

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.364 align:middle line:84%
which actually an Australian
philosopher called David

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Chalmers came up with
this a few years ago.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.769 align:middle line:84%
So, when you have
these experiences,

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:18.171 align:middle line:90%
they're life changing.

00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:20.406 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you realize that
this reality we are perceiving,

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.841 align:middle line:84%
there is something not
quite right about it.

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:25.345 align:middle line:84%
Rather like it's
said in the movie

00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.379 align:middle line:84%
"The Matrix" you know
there's something

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.883 align:middle line:84%
in your brain that's scratching
away that you don't feel.

00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:32.018 align:middle line:84%
There's something not
quite right with reality.

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:34.087 align:middle line:84%
All you need is one
noetic experience,

00:17:34.087 --> 00:17:35.421 align:middle line:90%
one precognitive experience

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to make your whole
world view change.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.259 align:middle line:84%
Now people who have
near-death experiences,

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:41.794 align:middle line:84%
their world view changes to such
an extent because they realize

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:84%
that there's a reality
behind this reality.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.568 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, going back to
the past life review,

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:51.804 align:middle line:84%
I suggest that at
the point of death,

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:53.439 align:middle line:90%
you relive your life again.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.542 align:middle line:84%
You literally are taken
back to the first seconds

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:58.945 align:middle line:84%
of your life again and you
literally relive it in a kind

00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:02.315 align:middle line:84%
of a video, matrix like
video of your own life.

00:18:02.315 --> 00:18:05.218 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But wouldn't it be--
why would it need to be stored

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:07.287 align:middle line:84%
in the brain rather
than outside?

00:18:07.287 --> 00:18:08.087 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: It isn't.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.455 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the arguments.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:11.991 align:middle line:84%
My-- I would consider my work
to be iterative in the sense

00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:14.761 align:middle line:84%
that my first book
was very much written

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.363 align:middle line:84%
from a somewhat materialist
reductions viewpoint

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:18.464 align:middle line:90%
in the sense.

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:19.799 align:middle line:84%
My argument then was
consciousness is written

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the near-death
experience is neurologically

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.874 align:middle line:84%
based but it is an experience
but it's neurologically based.

00:18:27.874 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
My work as it's moved on
are now coming far more

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.147 align:middle line:84%
to the conclusion that there
is a field of information.

00:18:34.147 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:84%
And in my book, "The Out-of-Body
Experience" I discussed this

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:41.621 align:middle line:84%
field of information, it's
basically the zero point field.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:44.123 align:middle line:84%
And again myself and Ervin
have discussed it, Ervin Laszlo

00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:46.426 align:middle line:84%
and myself, 'cause you know
Ervin Laszlo has written the

00:18:46.426 --> 00:18:49.529 align:middle line:84%
book called the "Science
and the Akashic Field".

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:51.631 align:middle line:84%
And Ervin-- that's why
Ervin is so intrigued

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:54.567 align:middle line:84%
with where I'm coming from
because I'm putting meat

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.736 align:middle line:90%
to the bone of his hypothesis.

00:18:56.736 --> 00:19:00.573 align:middle line:84%
So, what we have here is
the information is drawn

00:19:00.573 --> 00:19:03.042 align:middle line:90%
up from the zero point field.

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.678 align:middle line:84%
And a [inaudible] is
basically the akashic record,

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:08.648 align:middle line:84%
the akashic record of the
Vedas, you know the idea

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:11.351 align:middle line:84%
that there is a field
that contains everything.

00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.519 align:middle line:84%
It's the computer
program the universe runs

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.355 align:middle line:90%
on for want of a better term.

00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:17.724 align:middle line:84%
OK. And again in my
book "The Mindfield,"

00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:19.325 align:middle line:84%
I deal with the science
behind this

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.027 align:middle line:84%
as well 'cause everything
I write

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:23.863 align:middle line:84%
about is always referenced
back to academic papers.

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:26.165 align:middle line:84%
I never write anything that
my readers can't go back

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.501 align:middle line:84%
to check 'cause something
is profoundly important.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.569 align:middle line:90%
I very much believe

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.304 align:middle line:84%
at the diktat extraordinary
claims need

00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:32.572 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary proofs.

00:19:32.572 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It's all well and
good and I know a lot

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.074 align:middle line:90%
of my fellow writers do this,

00:19:35.074 --> 00:19:37.076 align:middle line:84%
where they just throw
information out

00:19:37.076 --> 00:19:38.878 align:middle line:84%
but they never give the
reader the opportunity

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:40.113 align:middle line:90%
to actually check it.

00:19:40.113 --> 00:19:42.882 align:middle line:84%
You know I never
claim anything other

00:19:42.882 --> 00:19:45.618 align:middle line:84%
than I am an enthusiastic
researcher

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:49.789 align:middle line:84%
and I research material
from other people's sources,

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:53.092 align:middle line:84%
you know, and I then write that
material and pull it together.

00:19:53.092 --> 00:19:56.162 align:middle line:84%
So, imagine this scenario they
say so in your final second

00:19:56.162 --> 00:19:59.065 align:middle line:84%
of your life and your
back to your childhood,

00:19:59.065 --> 00:20:01.067 align:middle line:84%
you live your life again,
you're living your life again

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:05.371 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you go,
"I've done this before."

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
a deja vu is.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.542 align:middle line:90%
It's what you feel it is.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:11.978 align:middle line:84%
It is literally you
reliving your life again.

00:20:11.978 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine the scenario that
if your life is programmed

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:20.687 align:middle line:84%
into the zero point field,
every alternate outcome

00:20:20.687 --> 00:20:22.889 align:middle line:84%
of every decision
you can possibly make

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:26.225 align:middle line:84%
in your life is also programmed
into zero point field,

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.593 align:middle line:90%
which effectively means

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.762 align:middle line:84%
that when you're living your
life again, you can change it.

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:32.532 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're living
in a movie of your life

00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:35.201 align:middle line:84%
where you can follow
any route you want to.

00:20:35.201 --> 00:20:37.437 align:middle line:84%
I always use the analysis
here, the Russian edition

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:39.973 align:middle line:84%
of my first book is actually
called "Groundhog Life"

00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:42.075 align:middle line:84%
because it's similar
to "Groundhog Day".

00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:45.244 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
Danny Rubin who wrote the movie

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.447 align:middle line:84%
"Groundhog Day" when
he came across my book,

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
gave copies of my first
book to all his friends.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.986 align:middle line:84%
He said, "This guy's actually
done the science of my movie."

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:56.522 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
Danny Rubin recently

00:20:56.522 --> 00:20:59.525 align:middle line:84%
and discussed the
implications of this.

00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:01.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That had to
be a juicy conversation.

00:21:01.227 --> 00:21:02.328 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Oh, he was funny.

00:21:02.328 --> 00:21:04.964 align:middle line:90%
He was hysterically funny,

00:21:04.964 --> 00:21:06.899 align:middle line:84%
one of the funniest guys
I've ever interviewed,

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:08.301 align:middle line:90%
really, really wonderful.

00:21:08.301 --> 00:21:11.037 align:middle line:84%
And it was a meeting of minds
because we just go on so well,

00:21:11.037 --> 00:21:12.438 align:middle line:84%
and I'm planning to
interview him again

00:21:12.438 --> 00:21:14.741 align:middle line:90%
on a future date as well.

00:21:14.741 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
This hypothesis I call
"Cheating The Ferryman"

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.812 align:middle line:84%
and I call it cheating the
ferryman because it's the idea

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:22.448 align:middle line:84%
that there's the old
myth that when you die,

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:84%
you go cross the River Styx
and the ferryman appears

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:27.987 align:middle line:84%
and you pay the ferryman a
little obolus, a little coin

00:21:27.987 --> 00:21:29.822 align:middle line:84%
and he takes you
across the River Styx

00:21:29.822 --> 00:21:31.224 align:middle line:90%
and you go to the-- beyond that.

00:21:31.224 --> 00:21:32.392 align:middle line:90%
You cheat the ferryman,

00:21:32.392 --> 00:21:34.127 align:middle line:84%
you never actually
get-- never cross.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.462 align:middle line:84%
You never pay him because
you never cross it.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:39.465 align:middle line:84%
Now another interesting aside
here is in ancient Greek myth,

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
there's something called, the
drinking of the River Lethe.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:45.004 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Lethe was
supposedly another tributary

00:21:45.004 --> 00:21:47.273 align:middle line:84%
of the River Styx and it's
the river of forgetting.

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:50.176 align:middle line:84%
And in ancient Greek
myths, people, if they wish

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:52.278 align:middle line:84%
to could go back and
live their life again.

00:21:52.278 --> 00:21:54.547 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do that,
they have to drink the waters

00:21:54.547 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:84%
of the Lethe, the
river of forgetting.

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.284 align:middle line:84%
And the all their memories were
wiped clean and they went back

00:21:58.284 --> 00:21:59.819 align:middle line:90%
and they lived their life again.

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So again, this principle
has deep-rooted resonance

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.927 align:middle line:84%
in many hypothesis and
theories, it also has elements

00:22:07.927 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of something called the eternal
recurrence, the eternal return

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.065 align:middle line:84%
which anthropologists have
talked about for centuries.

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.834 align:middle line:90%
Nietzsche talked about it.

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:18.805 align:middle line:84%
The Stoics, the ancient
Stoics talked about it.

00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics have talked
about it for centuries.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.276 align:middle line:84%
And I believe all
this works together

00:22:23.276 --> 00:22:26.412 align:middle line:84%
and that's very much why
I wrote the first book.

00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:29.248 align:middle line:84%
And that's the basic
hypothesis of the book.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:31.784 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, the second
book, "The Daemon,

00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:36.322 align:middle line:84%
A Guide to Your Extraordinary
Secret Self", suggests evidence

00:22:36.322 --> 00:22:38.691 align:middle line:90%
that there is part of you

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:40.126 align:middle line:84%
that remembers you've
lived this life again.

00:22:40.126 --> 00:22:42.895 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
imagine a scenario

00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:45.798 align:middle line:84%
that you're watching
a movie of your life

00:22:45.798 --> 00:22:48.901 align:middle line:84%
but you've seen it before and
you know what's coming next.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:51.037 align:middle line:84%
Or a better analogy, you're
playing a computer game,

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:54.841 align:middle line:84%
first person computer game,
you've played it before.

00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:58.744 align:middle line:84%
The computer game player
is being I call the daemon.

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
The daemon is your highest
self, it's your spirit guide.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.316 align:middle line:84%
It's that being that talks
to you quietly at night.

00:23:03.316 --> 00:23:06.385 align:middle line:84%
It's that being that warns
you, "I shouldn't do this,

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:08.054 align:middle line:90%
this person is wrong for me,"

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:10.756 align:middle line:84%
that instantaneous
recognition you have of people.

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:14.327 align:middle line:84%
I also argue that sometimes
deja vu sensations are very much

00:23:14.327 --> 00:23:18.264 align:middle line:84%
to tell you something about this
particular point in your life

00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:19.665 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision
that's different.

00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:22.101 align:middle line:84%
So the daemon is
your spirit guide,

00:23:22.101 --> 00:23:23.836 align:middle line:84%
the daemon is the
computer player,

00:23:23.836 --> 00:23:26.506 align:middle line:84%
the player that's playing the
computer game of your life.

00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:27.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Where?

00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.341 align:middle line:90%
Located where?

00:23:28.341 --> 00:23:30.776 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: He's located-- well
this is the question again

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.845 align:middle line:84%
and this is the reason
I wrote my book, time--

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:36.115 align:middle line:84%
the time book, "The Labyrinth
of Time" because of course,

00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:40.987 align:middle line:84%
we tend to assume that space
and time are out there,

00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:43.222 align:middle line:84%
that there is-- there
is distance between you

00:23:43.222 --> 00:23:44.056 align:middle line:90%
and I and everything else.

00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:46.425 align:middle line:90%
But the reality is, there isn't.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:50.863 align:middle line:84%
As Einstein once said,
if you take energy

00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
out of the universe,
there isn't anything.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.737 align:middle line:84%
Space is literally empty,
there is nothing there.

00:23:57.737 --> 00:23:59.539 align:middle line:90%
Time is an illusion.

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.574 align:middle line:84%
You know, we-- we talk
about time but when we talk

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:04.377 align:middle line:84%
about time, we're actually not
talking about time, are we?

00:24:04.377 --> 00:24:07.313 align:middle line:84%
You know, time dilates,
time can expand depending

00:24:07.313 --> 00:24:09.048 align:middle line:90%
on your mood, how you feel.

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:12.118 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, this
existence lives within time

00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:13.753 align:middle line:90%
and it lives within space.

00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:16.956 align:middle line:84%
The daemon exists outside of
time and outside of space.

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:19.125 align:middle line:84%
It's something again-- funny I
thought Philip K. Dick called

00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:90%
orthogonal time.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.396 align:middle line:84%
It's a time that is at the
right angle to this time.

00:24:23.396 --> 00:24:26.465 align:middle line:90%
So every point of our time flow,

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.702 align:middle line:84%
there is a right angle going
off called orthogonal time.

00:24:29.702 --> 00:24:31.103 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the daemon exists.

00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:34.006 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of timeless
zone but it's a sort of time

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:37.176 align:middle line:84%
at a different kind of time
and it views from outside there

00:24:37.176 --> 00:24:40.213 align:middle line:84%
and views in to you
living this life.

00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:42.448 align:middle line:84%
But I always use the
analogy of you all--

00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:44.517 align:middle line:84%
you and I are what
we term eidolons.

00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:46.218 align:middle line:84%
Daemon and eidolon by
the way are actually

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:47.987 align:middle line:90%
from Gnostic belief systems.

00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:50.056 align:middle line:84%
If you look them up, you
will find these are--

00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:52.658 align:middle line:84%
the word eidolon comes
from the word idol

00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:55.428 align:middle line:90%
as in is-- as in a facsimile.

00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:58.864 align:middle line:84%
So you and I, if we don't know
our own futures, we're eidolons,

00:24:58.864 --> 00:25:01.834 align:middle line:84%
we're the game-- we're the
little sprite on the screen,

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:04.537 align:middle line:84%
we're the little Lara Croft
that runs down the corridors

00:25:04.537 --> 00:25:06.505 align:middle line:84%
and eventually gets
eaten by the monster.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How about if
we are already at a stage

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.176 align:middle line:84%
where we're starting to
co-create and understand

00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:13.679 align:middle line:84%
that there is out there without
knowing about this higher self

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:17.416 align:middle line:84%
or without tapping into this
infinite potential, I guess?

00:25:17.416 --> 00:25:20.252 align:middle line:84%
But how about if we're already
consciously living our life,

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:21.721 align:middle line:90%
where are we at?

00:25:21.721 --> 00:25:22.955 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: I think there are people

00:25:22.955 --> 00:25:26.092 align:middle line:84%
who are all subliminally
aware of this anyway.

00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:28.794 align:middle line:84%
It's just what the not doing
is necessarily vocalizing

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:31.397 align:middle line:84%
or giving themselves
a model to understand.

00:25:31.397 --> 00:25:33.933 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are certain
advanced human beings

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:36.902 align:middle line:84%
that are just instinctively
aware of the fact.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:39.405 align:middle line:84%
And I think what is happening
now is that there seem

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:42.208 align:middle line:84%
to be a sea change whereby
people are becoming more

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:43.609 align:middle line:84%
and more interested in
this kind of material.

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:46.379 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that is a big B

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
in my bonnet is there
is an awful lot

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.183 align:middle line:84%
of what I call snake
oil salesman out there,

00:25:51.183 --> 00:25:55.121 align:middle line:84%
people who will sell
you anything to make--

00:25:55.121 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:90%
to make a book really.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.393 align:middle line:84%
And they're the people that
cause problems for people

00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:03.629 align:middle line:84%
like myself because I'm
not selling anything.

00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:06.599 align:middle line:84%
All I'm giving is
people ideas of thinking

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:09.201 align:middle line:84%
about their own interface
with reality.

00:26:09.201 --> 00:26:10.703 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not a special guy.

00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:11.937 align:middle line:90%
I don't have advanced powers.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.205 align:middle line:90%
I'm not channeling information

00:26:13.205 --> 00:26:15.675 align:middle line:84%
from the planet Zog
[phonetic] or anything.

00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.677 align:middle line:84%
All I'm doing is somebody
looking at information,

00:26:17.677 --> 00:26:18.744 align:middle line:90%
pulling it together and saying,

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:21.747 align:middle line:84%
"This makes a certain
degree of sense."

00:26:21.747 --> 00:26:25.184 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we need to
do is to actually keep our--

00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:27.553 align:middle line:84%
keep our feet firmly on
the ground in these things,

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:30.756 align:middle line:84%
keep an open mind, but
not your open mind enough

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:32.091 align:middle line:90%
that your brain falls out.

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:34.226 align:middle line:84%
Because all that's going to
happen there is you're going

00:26:34.226 --> 00:26:35.661 align:middle line:90%
to be pushed along the route.

00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.997 align:middle line:84%
I think you don't
gain anything from.

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You have to evaluate through
your own experiences exactly

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.735 align:middle line:90%
what is happening in your life.

00:26:42.735 --> 00:26:46.505 align:middle line:84%
Just observe the things,
observe your deja vu sensations,

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:48.774 align:middle line:84%
observe your precognitive
dreams.

00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:50.576 align:middle line:84%
If you have an out of
the body experience

00:26:50.576 --> 00:26:53.279 align:middle line:84%
or you have a lucid dream,
just observe what's happening

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:56.515 align:middle line:84%
and what is taking place
because you're here to learn,

00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:59.185 align:middle line:84%
it's your learning
process, this is your life.

00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:01.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But in the
practical side, so how--

00:27:01.053 --> 00:27:03.422 align:middle line:90%
how do you actually live that?

00:27:03.422 --> 00:27:06.425 align:middle line:84%
I guess, as you were writing
those books, you-- you had--

00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:09.862 align:middle line:84%
you experience many things
so how do you put this all

00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:13.733 align:middle line:84%
in practice and how can it
be practical in our life?

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:14.967 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: I wish I knew.

00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.002 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that people say to me many,

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:19.371 align:middle line:84%
many times and they say, "Can't
you put together some kind

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:22.775 align:middle line:84%
of a course on this or
can't you do workshops?"

00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:25.211 align:middle line:84%
Now, I did a workshop two
years ago, The Mind Body

00:27:25.211 --> 00:27:27.113 align:middle line:84%
and Spirit Festival
here in London,

00:27:27.113 --> 00:27:29.315 align:middle line:84%
in fact around the corner
from here at Earls Court.

00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:31.083 align:middle line:90%
And I will be later on this year

00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:33.919 align:middle line:84%
in November doing
something similar in Brighton

00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.921 align:middle line:84%
for the Mind Body
and Spirit people.

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:38.524 align:middle line:84%
And people [inaudible] and
say, "Can you do a workshop?"

00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:43.162 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "I don't train people
to do it because it's as--

00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:45.798 align:middle line:84%
it's as much a mystery to me
as it is to everybody else.

00:27:45.798 --> 00:27:48.768 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm learning as well.

00:27:48.768 --> 00:27:52.538 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say to people,
read my books but realize

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:54.874 align:middle line:90%
that my later books will change

00:27:54.874 --> 00:27:56.742 align:middle line:84%
because as I discover
more information,

00:27:56.742 --> 00:27:58.244 align:middle line:90%
as I read more research--

00:27:58.244 --> 00:28:00.679 align:middle line:84%
for instance at the moment
I'm fascinated at the moment

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:06.051 align:middle line:84%
to the role of DNA and
biophotons and bioluminescence

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.386 align:middle line:90%
and the role of light.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And the way in which light
comes out from the body as much

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.391 align:middle line:90%
as it goes into the body,

00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:15.661 align:middle line:84%
and of course light is
electromagnetic radiation.

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:19.732 align:middle line:84%
And I'm intrigued by how these
interfaces with quantum physics.

00:28:19.732 --> 00:28:22.635 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, my approach to
quantum physics is scientific.

00:28:22.635 --> 00:28:26.272 align:middle line:84%
I don't use quantum physics
to prove anything other

00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:28.174 align:middle line:84%
than the fact that
we have to understand

00:28:28.174 --> 00:28:31.477 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain curious
effects within quantum physics

00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:34.947 align:middle line:84%
that suggest that
reality is observer based,

00:28:34.947 --> 00:28:38.217 align:middle line:84%
that the active observation
does collapse away function

00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:40.252 align:middle line:90%
into a form of reality.

00:28:40.252 --> 00:28:42.822 align:middle line:84%
You know, this-- this is--
this is a known fact, you know,

00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:45.324 align:middle line:84%
and if ever you want quantum
physicists who's a materials

00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:47.993 align:middle line:84%
reductionist to choke
on their corn flakes,

00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:50.596 align:middle line:84%
just ask them explain the
observer problem please.

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:52.064 align:middle line:90%
Because it is self evident

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:57.136 align:middle line:84%
that subatomic particles
are a statistical--

00:28:57.136 --> 00:29:00.105 align:middle line:84%
all subatomic particle
is a statistical wave

00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
of a probability.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.709 align:middle line:84%
The minute this is
observed or measured,

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:07.413 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a point particle and
it becomes a point particle.

00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:10.149 align:middle line:84%
Now for instance, many people
are not aware of this fact,

00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:12.351 align:middle line:84%
but there's been a
series of experiments done

00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:16.222 align:middle line:84%
by a guy called Anton Zeilinger
of the University of Vienna.

00:29:16.222 --> 00:29:19.158 align:middle line:90%
And he has been able to prove

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:22.862 align:middle line:84%
that large molecules
actually have this,

00:29:22.862 --> 00:29:25.197 align:middle line:84%
what's called wave
particle duality.

00:29:25.197 --> 00:29:27.366 align:middle line:84%
Now large molecules are
what makes the world up.

00:29:27.366 --> 00:29:30.236 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's around
us is made up of molecules.

00:29:30.236 --> 00:29:33.038 align:middle line:84%
And molecules are affected
by the active observation.

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:36.108 align:middle line:84%
Now certainly that makes this
reality look very, very curious

00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:41.714 align:middle line:90%
and very, very strange.

00:29:41.714 --> 00:29:44.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I-- this is so-- this
is so intriguing, you know,

00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:46.986 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- as I know many
people watching

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:51.156 align:middle line:84%
and I will include myself,
we're so called into digging

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.759 align:middle line:84%
and to discovering
and to learning more

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:56.929 align:middle line:84%
and intuitively we have
this, this, this, this,

00:29:56.929 --> 00:29:59.164 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always intrigued
to the practical aspect

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:02.501 align:middle line:84%
and how can we get even
deeper in those realms.

00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:07.406 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if with your
experience you could tell us how

00:30:07.406 --> 00:30:12.411 align:middle line:84%
when we have those deja vus
for example, what are those

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:15.848 align:middle line:84%
and how-- there's-- it's
like a piece is missing

00:30:15.848 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:84%
from what I'm hearing so I
can see the full picture.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:24.056 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: One of the-- you know,
this question that's asked many,

00:30:24.056 --> 00:30:26.959 align:middle line:84%
many times of myself which, you
know, what does this all mean.

00:30:26.959 --> 00:30:28.894 align:middle line:84%
You know, what does
it mean for me?

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:34.566 align:middle line:84%
What it means for you is that
you are a unique consciousness,

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:37.636 align:middle line:84%
existing in, for want
of a better term,

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:38.837 align:middle line:90%
your own computer game.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:44.209 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, if you know
that that is the case,

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.912 align:middle line:84%
you can then train
yourself to possibly,

00:30:46.912 --> 00:30:49.782 align:middle line:84%
not manipulate your reality
because it's not quite the same

00:30:49.782 --> 00:30:54.586 align:middle line:84%
but you can use your reality
in a more kind of dynamic way.

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:57.389 align:middle line:84%
You can realize that
these things--

00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:58.557 align:middle line:90%
there are messages in things.

00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.926 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'm
fascinated by synchronicity.

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I contributed an article to
a book called "The Sync Book"

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.131 align:middle line:90%
which was published in the US

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:08.067 align:middle line:84%
around about six or
seven months ago.

00:31:08.067 --> 00:31:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm also interested in the work
of people like Daniel Pinchbeck

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.105 align:middle line:84%
in terms of synchronicity
and such like.

00:31:13.105 --> 00:31:15.774 align:middle line:84%
I think that synchronicity is
trying to tell us something.

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:18.811 align:middle line:84%
I think there are certain prompt
phenomenon, they're intriguing,

00:31:18.811 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm intrigued by the
11:11 prompt phenomenon.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.316 align:middle line:84%
You know the idea that you
see 11:11 all the time.

00:31:24.316 --> 00:31:25.417 align:middle line:90%
Now, as an--

00:31:25.417 --> 00:31:26.986 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I have
that all the time

00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:28.454 align:middle line:90%
and I know many people that do.

00:31:28.454 --> 00:31:29.822 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Now get this.

00:31:29.822 --> 00:31:33.392 align:middle line:84%
What really intrigued me was
that I was talking about this

00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:35.094 align:middle line:84%
to my wife recently,
I'm saying this 11:11,

00:31:35.094 --> 00:31:36.095 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing it everywhere.

00:31:36.095 --> 00:31:37.763 align:middle line:84%
And she turned around
and she said,

00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:39.865 align:middle line:84%
"You've got a personal
message for 11:11, you know."

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:40.699 align:middle line:90%
And I said," What do you mean?"

00:31:40.699 --> 00:31:43.168 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Look at the title

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:45.704 align:middle line:84%
of your Dutch edition
of your first book.

00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:47.039 align:middle line:90%
What's the title?"

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.907 align:middle line:90%
It's called 11 : 11 : 11.

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.277 align:middle line:84%
It's Dutch for life
after life after life.

00:31:52.277 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now is that nature's subtle
way of giving us a message?

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.283 align:middle line:84%
Because the Dutch people would
probably not necessarily realize

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.685 align:middle line:90%
that life after life after life

00:31:59.685 --> 00:32:02.521 align:middle line:84%
in Dutch means 11 :
11 : 11 in English.

00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:07.793 align:middle line:84%
So we have those kind of
little weird almost cosmic joke

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:10.562 align:middle line:84%
of what Young called the
[inaudible] the cosmic joke

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:13.098 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes gives you
a little wake up call.

00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:16.301 align:middle line:84%
And I think you use the analogy
of the movie "Groundhog Day".

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:17.703 align:middle line:84%
In "Groundhog Day",
Jimmy Connors,

00:32:17.703 --> 00:32:20.506 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually working
Wimbledon at the moment

00:32:20.506 --> 00:32:23.308 align:middle line:84%
so I've got tennis
players on my mind.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.345 align:middle line:84%
That Connors, the
central character,

00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:27.713 align:middle line:90%
the Bill Murray character,

00:32:27.713 --> 00:32:29.615 align:middle line:84%
he lives the same day
over and over again.

00:32:29.615 --> 00:32:31.917 align:middle line:84%
And if you know the
movie, what you will see is

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that initially he has the
advantage over everybody else

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.688 align:middle line:84%
because he knows what's
going to happen next.

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:39.992 align:middle line:84%
He uses that to his advantage
and he tries to bed the girl,

00:32:39.992 --> 00:32:43.128 align:middle line:84%
he tries to do all this kind
of incredibly selfish things.

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:46.165 align:middle line:84%
But then he realizes
that this is a gift.

00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So he teaches himself
foreign languages.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.168 align:middle line:84%
He teaches himself
how to play the piano.

00:32:49.168 --> 00:32:53.739 align:middle line:84%
But he's all trying to do
it so he can woe the girl.

00:32:53.739 --> 00:32:56.775 align:middle line:84%
But then he realizes
that he can do good.

00:32:56.775 --> 00:32:57.843 align:middle line:90%
So he runs around the town

00:32:57.843 --> 00:32:59.344 align:middle line:84%
and make sure he's
underneath the tree

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:02.014 align:middle line:84%
when a little boy
falls from the tree.

00:33:02.014 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I suspect this is what
our lives are all about.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
I think our lives are
about us developing

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.323 align:middle line:84%
as a better human being,
to become an avatar,

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:14.193 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
term, you know the idea--

00:33:14.193 --> 00:33:16.395 align:middle line:84%
you know people argue
when reincarnation.

00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:18.464 align:middle line:84%
The theory of reincarnation
is that you come back

00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:20.332 align:middle line:84%
as different people
in different times

00:33:20.332 --> 00:33:23.102 align:middle line:84%
and you eventually
live the perfect life.

00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:26.305 align:middle line:84%
I argue that it's
the same principle

00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:29.541 align:middle line:84%
but you live the
perfect life as you.

00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:32.811 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you live
your life over and over again

00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:34.480 align:middle line:90%
until you get it right.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.714 align:middle line:90%
And you live the perfect life.

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:37.082 align:middle line:90%
You win the computer game.

00:33:37.082 --> 00:33:39.284 align:middle line:84%
You know what is a first
person computer game,

00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:41.687 align:middle line:84%
when you're running down the
corridors, the ultimate aim is

00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:43.622 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get to
the end of the game,

00:33:43.622 --> 00:33:45.224 align:middle line:90%
and that is what life is.

00:33:45.224 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Life is a time where you will
come back again and again

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.262 align:middle line:84%
and again until you
get it right.

00:33:50.262 --> 00:33:53.065 align:middle line:84%
Then when you get it
right, you then move on.

00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:55.367 align:middle line:84%
You're allowed to move on
whether there's a judgment going

00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:56.702 align:middle line:90%
on here or not, I don't know

00:33:56.702 --> 00:34:01.273 align:middle line:84%
because that is beyond
my appreciation of that.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:04.076 align:middle line:84%
But there's another subtle
moral, more subtle idea to this,

00:34:04.076 --> 00:34:06.545 align:middle line:90%
and I cite this in my next book.

00:34:06.545 --> 00:34:09.414 align:middle line:84%
There is an idea, and Bill
Hicks very much cited this,

00:34:09.414 --> 00:34:12.017 align:middle line:84%
the American comedian, when
he turned around and said,

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:16.088 align:middle line:84%
"Breaking news: young man
on acid suddenly realizes

00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:20.025 align:middle line:84%
that we are all one
consciousness experiencing

00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:21.459 align:middle line:90%
itself subjectively."

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.396 align:middle line:84%
And this is the move-- I'm
walking moving to now is

00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:27.032 align:middle line:84%
that you and I and all
those viewers out there,

00:34:27.032 --> 00:34:30.536 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else, we are
one single consciousness

00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:32.804 align:middle line:84%
experiencing itself
subjectively.

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly this
gets quite complex

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.278 align:middle line:84%
because it suddenly makes you
realize that this is almost

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:90%
like a role playing game.

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:43.782 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness it's the--
for want of a better word,

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:46.919 align:middle line:84%
god is the wrong term because
it has certain connotations,

00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:50.655 align:middle line:84%
but whatever the great substance
is that's created all this is

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:53.992 align:middle line:84%
within us all and it's
part of us and it is us.

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:57.296 align:middle line:84%
Now, particularly people
who take dimethyltryptamine

00:34:57.296 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and ayahuasca, they always talk
about this feeling of oneness

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:84%
that they get, the
holistic feel,

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:05.904 align:middle line:90%
the being part of everything.

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:08.473 align:middle line:84%
Mystics have talked
about it for centuries.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:11.610 align:middle line:84%
This is because under certain
circumstances, we can attune

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.079 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that we
are one consciousness.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:15.814 align:middle line:84%
Now again, you can
do the science

00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:18.016 align:middle line:84%
of this 'cause Professor
Bernard Haisch,

00:35:18.016 --> 00:35:21.386 align:middle line:84%
who is an American
astrophysicist has written this

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:23.255 align:middle line:84%
in a book called
"The God Theory".

00:35:23.255 --> 00:35:27.125 align:middle line:84%
There is also a guy
called Martin W. Ball,

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.761 align:middle line:84%
who's an anthropologist, who
has written a book called

00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:31.363 align:middle line:90%
"The Entheological Paradigm"

00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:34.499 align:middle line:84%
and he does the anthropology
of all this as well.

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:35.601 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of very, very--

00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Larry Dossey as well.

00:35:36.835 --> 00:35:39.204 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: Larry of course,
yes of course Larry Dossey.

00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:43.508 align:middle line:84%
So we have here a lot of people
who were going down this route.

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:47.212 align:middle line:84%
What I think I'm doing is,
being the eclectic thinker I am,

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:90%
is I'm taking information

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.617 align:middle line:84%
from as many wide sources
that I possibly can.

00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:52.818 align:middle line:90%
You know from everything,

00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:55.354 align:middle line:84%
from anthropology,
even to the Kabbalah.

00:35:55.354 --> 00:35:58.457 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually interfacing
with Kabbalah scholars.

00:35:58.457 --> 00:36:04.096 align:middle line:84%
There is a friend of mine
called Joel Bakst, who is based

00:36:04.096 --> 00:36:06.965 align:middle line:84%
in Denver in Colorado
who's a rabbi

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:10.235 align:middle line:84%
and his work is fascinating
because he links DMT,

00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:14.907 align:middle line:84%
dimethyltryptamine together
with teaches from the Torah,

00:36:14.907 --> 00:36:19.444 align:middle line:84%
and it's uncanny stuff and
it really all pulls together.

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:23.782 align:middle line:84%
So effectively we have this huge
picture, and I sometimes feel

00:36:23.782 --> 00:36:25.951 align:middle line:84%
that I've got all these little
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle

00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:28.954 align:middle line:84%
and I feel one day, they're
all going to fit into place

00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:30.856 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go,
wow, that's incredible.

00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:32.557 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment,
I'm still searching

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:33.959 align:middle line:84%
around the dark like
everybody else.

00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:37.262 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a little bit further
along the route than some people

00:36:37.262 --> 00:36:39.097 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
I'm special or anything.

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:90%
It just means that things seem--

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.169 align:middle line:84%
information seems to
have been given to me,

00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:47.706 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be supplied to me
when I need it, quite peculiar.

00:36:47.706 --> 00:36:50.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Which is the
potential of all of us,

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:53.779 align:middle line:84%
receiving those bits of
information and having them

00:36:53.779 --> 00:36:58.116 align:middle line:84%
so that we can live
this potential so--

00:36:58.116 --> 00:37:02.087 align:middle line:84%
but when you talk of the
universe or the oneness

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:06.058 align:middle line:84%
so we would all have a role to
play and so there's this kind

00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:08.894 align:middle line:84%
of this idea of being
selfless and following the flow

00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:12.397 align:middle line:84%
and the synchronicity but
also being an actor there.

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.666 align:middle line:84%
What did you find
about this dynamic?

00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.068 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Yeah, I know.

00:37:16.068 --> 00:37:18.637 align:middle line:84%
This is very much the dynamic I
feel that sometimes people turn

00:37:18.637 --> 00:37:22.808 align:middle line:84%
around and say you know that
if I do harm to somebody else,

00:37:22.808 --> 00:37:25.744 align:middle line:84%
you know, some people
can be profoundly selfish

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:27.245 align:middle line:84%
and they can-- they could
walk on other people

00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:28.613 align:middle line:84%
and they can destroy
the people's lives

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:31.316 align:middle line:84%
to actually gain wealth
or fame or whatever.

00:37:31.316 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:84%
But if we are all one
entity experiencing itself

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:35.721 align:middle line:84%
subjectively, all you are
actually effectively doing is

00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:37.255 align:middle line:90%
damaging yourself.

00:37:37.255 --> 00:37:38.724 align:middle line:84%
In other words, by
damaging other people

00:37:38.724 --> 00:37:41.293 align:middle line:84%
and hurting other people, you
are in fact hurting yourself

00:37:41.293 --> 00:37:43.762 align:middle line:84%
and damaging your own
self and giving yourself,

00:37:43.762 --> 00:37:45.397 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
term, bad karma.

00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:50.635 align:middle line:84%
So when you come back and live
your life again, you should--

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:53.038 align:middle line:90%
something maybe is aware of--

00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:54.706 align:middle line:84%
you're daemon maybe
aware of the fact

00:37:54.706 --> 00:37:56.908 align:middle line:84%
that you did this
thing wrong last time

00:37:56.908 --> 00:37:59.578 align:middle line:84%
because we've all done things
in our past lives, I know I have

00:37:59.578 --> 00:38:01.513 align:middle line:90%
where I've hurt people terribly.

00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:05.183 align:middle line:84%
And I wish, I wish, I
wish I haven't done that.

00:38:05.183 --> 00:38:07.085 align:middle line:84%
You know if I could
put the clock back.

00:38:07.085 --> 00:38:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But it's like
time doesn't exist.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.122 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: But it doesn't, exactly.

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:12.557 align:middle line:84%
So in which case you can't put
the clock back because you live

00:38:12.557 --> 00:38:15.193 align:middle line:84%
that life again and
this time around,

00:38:15.193 --> 00:38:17.429 align:middle line:84%
you won't say those things,
you won't do those things

00:38:17.429 --> 00:38:21.299 align:middle line:84%
because something inside you
will say, "Don't do this,

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.934 align:middle line:90%
do something different."

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:25.904 align:middle line:84%
Become almost-- it's again
the wrong term but a saint,

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:28.974 align:middle line:84%
to the concept of a saint who
somebody lives a pure life.

00:38:28.974 --> 00:38:32.878 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're all here
to do, is to live a pure life.

00:38:32.878 --> 00:38:34.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That is
a life, I guess,

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:36.081 align:middle line:84%
based on compassion
and gratitude.

00:38:36.081 --> 00:38:37.215 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Exactly.

00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:39.151 align:middle line:84%
And understanding and
appreciating everybody.

00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:41.753 align:middle line:84%
I mean one of the,
one of the writers

00:38:41.753 --> 00:38:43.655 align:middle line:84%
that fascinates me
is Tom Campbell,

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.557 align:middle line:84%
a guy that's written a
series of books called

00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.393 align:middle line:84%
"My Big Toe" my grand-- my big
grand theory of everything.

00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:50.262 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Tom discusses

00:38:50.262 --> 00:38:55.033 align:middle line:84%
in his work is the idea of
energy and negative energy,

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:57.869 align:middle line:84%
and how it is that when
we harm other people,

00:38:57.869 --> 00:39:00.572 align:middle line:84%
it has a bad effect
on everything.

00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:04.009 align:middle line:84%
You know, where as if
we work with each other,

00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:06.077 align:middle line:84%
everything is much
better when we cooperate

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.746 align:middle line:90%
and when we help each other.

00:39:07.746 --> 00:39:09.414 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can
all work together.

00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:12.484 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's the old picture
isn't it, of the two goats

00:39:12.484 --> 00:39:14.186 align:middle line:84%
with a piece of string
roped between them

00:39:14.186 --> 00:39:16.088 align:middle line:84%
and they're both pulling
against each other to eat food.

00:39:16.088 --> 00:39:18.323 align:middle line:84%
And there's two sections
of food either side.

00:39:18.323 --> 00:39:20.325 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if they cooperate,
they can both turn around

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%
and eat the food together.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.795 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is such
a strong, strong image

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:84%
and I think this is
the future of mankind,

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:29.935 align:middle line:84%
but so much of mankind
now is getting so selfish.

00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:31.002 align:middle line:90%
I almost get the feeling

00:39:31.002 --> 00:39:32.437 align:middle line:84%
that mankind is splitting
into two groups.

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:35.407 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual seekers
and spiritually,

00:39:35.407 --> 00:39:36.541 align:middle line:90%
you know, spirituality is--

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:37.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: There's another label.

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:39.845 align:middle line:84%
>> AP: Yeah, it's another
label which is a bad one,

00:39:39.845 --> 00:39:41.446 align:middle line:84%
and it shouldn't be
used in that way.

00:39:41.446 --> 00:39:46.485 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is just a--
realizing that I am an entity

00:39:46.485 --> 00:39:49.488 align:middle line:84%
that is perceiving
reality from somewhere

00:39:49.488 --> 00:39:53.959 align:middle line:84%
within this three dimensional
reality, but I'm more than this.

00:39:53.959 --> 00:39:57.796 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make me special
because we are all special

00:39:57.796 --> 00:39:59.898 align:middle line:84%
and none of us is special,
if that makes sense.

00:39:59.898 --> 00:40:01.466 align:middle line:84%
But we need-- we
are here to learn

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:03.168 align:middle line:84%
and we're here to
help each other.

00:40:03.168 --> 00:40:05.837 align:middle line:84%
Whereas there are other people
that really have no empathy,

00:40:05.837 --> 00:40:09.241 align:middle line:84%
that really want to just
destroy and hurt other people.

00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
greatest truth, and it's taught

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.714 align:middle line:84%
in all religions, it's taught
in all sympathetic philosophies.

00:40:15.714 --> 00:40:18.016 align:middle line:84%
It's the perennial
philosophy, you know,

00:40:18.016 --> 00:40:22.721 align:middle line:84%
and it really is this idea
that we are evolving beings.

00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:24.189 align:middle line:90%
As Teilhard de Chardin said,

00:40:24.189 --> 00:40:26.825 align:middle line:84%
"We are spiritual beings
having a physical life,"

00:40:26.825 --> 00:40:29.761 align:middle line:84%
and that's very much
my philosophy.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:31.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Feels great

00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:34.032 align:middle line:84%
to be spiritual beings right
now living this experience.

00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I feel that more and more,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.903 align:middle line:84%
a lot of us as you said it's
splitting, the New Earth, huh?

00:40:37.903 --> 00:40:39.905 align:middle line:84%
Some people are speaking
of the New Earth,

00:40:39.905 --> 00:40:43.074 align:middle line:84%
even Dolores Cannon was
speaking of, kind of the split.

00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- I feel
we're living it now,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.913 align:middle line:84%
wherever we are physically,
however--

00:40:47.913 --> 00:40:50.982 align:middle line:84%
there's so many theories but
in the end, it has to resonate

00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:53.385 align:middle line:84%
through their selves too because
there's so many people saying

00:40:53.385 --> 00:40:54.920 align:middle line:90%
so many things out there.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.321 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Well that's it.

00:40:56.321 --> 00:40:59.925 align:middle line:84%
You have to make your choices
but what we don't want is a kind

00:40:59.925 --> 00:41:02.127 align:middle line:90%
of a Harper's Bazaar [phonetic]

00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:04.663 align:middle line:84%
of you choose what thing
you want to believe in.

00:41:04.663 --> 00:41:06.898 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say to people
who are interested in my work,

00:41:06.898 --> 00:41:09.534 align:middle line:84%
"I am not a guru,
please, please, please.

00:41:09.534 --> 00:41:10.735 align:middle line:90%
I am not a guru."

00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:13.338 align:middle line:84%
Time and time again, I
don't have the answers.

00:41:13.338 --> 00:41:14.839 align:middle line:84%
I'm a questioner,
I'm a questioner

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.174 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else is.

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm a searcher, I've been
fortunate enough to have people

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.581 align:middle line:84%
who have been willing to
be interested in my work

00:41:22.581 --> 00:41:24.683 align:middle line:90%
and publish my books for me.

00:41:24.683 --> 00:41:27.852 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm
internally grateful for that.

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:31.489 align:middle line:84%
But my ideas are progressing
and they're always progressing

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.792 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just a searcher
so I'm nobody special

00:41:33.792 --> 00:41:36.428 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have any
great answers.

00:41:36.428 --> 00:41:38.063 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
I would ever want

00:41:38.063 --> 00:41:39.764 align:middle line:84%
to have the answers
for other people.

00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:42.033 align:middle line:84%
We are all here to
find our own way,

00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:45.604 align:middle line:84%
and if my books help
people see the world

00:41:45.604 --> 00:41:47.339 align:middle line:84%
in the way I see it,
that's wonderful.

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:49.474 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean the way
I see the world is right.

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:52.911 align:middle line:84%
It just means it's the way it
seems to make sense for me.

00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:54.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:56.781 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much
for this delicious moment.

00:41:56.781 --> 00:42:01.886 align:middle line:84%
We have all enjoyed this and I
look forward having another one

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.622 align:middle line:90%
of these juicy conversations.

00:42:03.622 --> 00:42:04.689 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:42:04.689 --> 00:42:06.157 align:middle line:90%
>> AP: Thank you very much.

00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:08.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Much much
love Juicy co-creators,

00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:10.729 align:middle line:84%

Bye-bye.
