>> Lilou: Hello, my juicy
co-creators. This is Lilou here
in

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:16.384 align:middle line:84%
London in England, ready to have
another delicious conversation

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:17.752 align:middle line:90%
with you, Jay, today.

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:21.489 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for accepting to do
this interview, this to meet

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.458 align:middle line:84%
up here in beautiful,
sunny London. Wow.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Jay Lakhani: Yes,
we are lucky to get

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.994 align:middle line:90%
such good weather, Lilou.

00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:30.097 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So there's many
topics to speak with you about.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:31.499 align:middle line:84%
I saw your, you know,
your TEDx,

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.268 align:middle line:84%
and there you were
talking of quantum physics,

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.638 align:middle line:84%
but you're very much
interested about religion, too,

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:43.177 align:middle line:84%
and you often speak at colleges
and you did your own studies

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.146 align:middle line:90%
as a physician or a physicist?

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: Physicist.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So we can go in many,

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:84%
many different topics
and I love that.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.653 align:middle line:84%
I love when I can
ask any question

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:54.321 align:middle line:84%
and basically the
person is right there.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You're originally
from Kenya, right?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Yes, I
was born in Kenya.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.293 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Hindu from India
originally family wise,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:01.962 align:middle line:84%
but I was personally
born in Kenya.

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:05.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So first since we have
to start somewhere, I would love

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:10.071 align:middle line:84%
to speak of the religious aspect
just to see where you're at

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.541 align:middle line:84%
and what you feel where
people are at around the world

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.843 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
big topic right now

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.912 align:middle line:84%
and you get to speak
at colleges.

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:20.314 align:middle line:84%
So what is your view on the
whole religion even though

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're Hindu, how do you
view this and where is it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.685 align:middle line:90%
at right now in the world?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:27.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: You see I personally
believe that all religions,

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:28.689 align:middle line:90%
all of them, not Hinduism only,

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.158 align:middle line:84%
all religious basically are
pointing at a deeper dimension

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.695 align:middle line:84%
to reality that we're not
normally aware of.

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.364 align:middle line:84%
So religions have a way
of polarizing our minds

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:40.967 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper dimension reality
that is sometimes missed out.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, we live
very material life

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.239 align:middle line:84%
and underpinning
this material world

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.342 align:middle line:84%
and underpinning our essential
being, there's something

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:51.679 align:middle line:84%
non-material that is trying
to manifest or express itself

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:52.947 align:middle line:90%
and that I call spiritual.

00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:55.382 align:middle line:84%
So, my journey is really
to try and suss

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.384 align:middle line:84%
out the human condition
and to see

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:84%
if there's something
much more to us

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.889 align:middle line:84%
than what meets the eye,
the material frame.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And where do you
think, because you speak

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.961 align:middle line:84%
to colleges, at 16 year
olds, 18 year olds,

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.629 align:middle line:90%
where do you think they're at

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.564 align:middle line:84%
and where is society
at with that?

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:11.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: The world is
very interesting now, you see,

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.401 align:middle line:84%
because we sometimes feel
the modern society has

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
forgotten religions and
they're going to become

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.571 align:middle line:90%
and they're lost in the way.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:19.073 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing of the sort.

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:22.543 align:middle line:84%
Humanity continues to
evolve and evolve at a pace

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.345 align:middle line:90%
that suits his own requirement.

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.047 align:middle line:84%
What I find with the modern
youth is a very refreshing

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:29.683 align:middle line:84%
approach to what religions
were all about in the past,

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.585 align:middle line:84%
and so they are trying
to re-explore

00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:34.054 align:middle line:84%
or rediscover the spiritual
underpinning

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:37.391 align:middle line:84%
without using a prescriptive
religion. So this is a reality.

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:40.127 align:middle line:84%
When I go to schools, I do lots
of assemblies. I must have gone

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.364 align:middle line:84%
to few hundred schools in
London or UK I would say

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:46.667 align:middle line:84%
and I've done a few hundred
assemblies, and when I ask 16

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.537 align:middle line:84%
to 18 year age group and you
take your name as a Hindu

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:52.273 align:middle line:90%
or a Buddhist or whatever,

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:55.409 align:middle line:84%
but do you truly agree
with this enterprise?

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.346 align:middle line:84%
What I am finding surprisingly
and perhaps very interestingly

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:03.517 align:middle line:84%
is that sometimes 90% of these
youngsters who are thinking

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
for themselves now very
happily put their hands

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.856 align:middle line:84%
up as being agnostic,
they're not sure

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:10.424 align:middle line:84%
about their religious
enterprise,

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:84%
or as atheists saying
the religions are definitely

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.528 align:middle line:90%
flawed. They're wrong.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:90%
So this is reality.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.932 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a world where
the majority

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:20.134 align:middle line:90%
of youngsters now can no longer

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.236 align:middle line:84%
relate to a prescriptive
religion.

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.038 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism or Christianity
or whatever.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:26.006 align:middle line:90%
This is reality.

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.543 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how, because I saw
your talks on quantum physics,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:33.547 align:middle line:84%
how is quantum physics
related to the spiritual world?

00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Suppose I was
talking to the elite thinking

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.485 align:middle line:84%
youngsters in this country, at
MIT, at Oxford University

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
and Eatong College,
et cetera,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.922 align:middle line:84%
and suppose I said look,
here is this, you know,

00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:45.159 align:middle line:84%
this marvelous scripture of the
ancient Hindus, and we talk

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.861 align:middle line:84%
about this and they run away
from me. But if I say look,

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.831 align:middle line:84%
I come from a science lobby
and not a hippy science

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.734 align:middle line:84%
but, I feel, a very mainstream
science lobby.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I studied physics at Imperial
College and specialized

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.806 align:middle line:84%
in quantum mechanics, which
is supposed to be very stylish

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:02.309 align:middle line:84%
and esoteric physics, and I did
it under somebody very famous,

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Roger Penrose,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.813 align:middle line:84%
who is probably the second
most important physicist

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:07.982 align:middle line:84%
in the country. So, I come
with the right pedigree

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:11.684 align:middle line:84%
of science pedigree so when I
present my ideas regarding what

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:15.289 align:middle line:84%
I think is spirituality in
a format which is rational

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:19.293 align:middle line:84%
and science oriented, of course
I steal the show.

00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:23.163 align:middle line:84%
They love me. They applaud
me very warmly and, you know,

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:24.331 align:middle line:90%
sometimes wait in a line

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.799 align:middle line:84%
to shake my hand
saying we loved that,

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:27.768 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Lakhani! That was very
interesting.

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.038 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, the support I
get regarding my vision

00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:32.306 align:middle line:90%
about spirituality doesn't come

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.842 align:middle line:84%
from antiquitious
scriptures of the Hindus,

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:37.011 align:middle line:84%
it comes from modern
science itself

00:04:37.011 --> 00:04:40.714 align:middle line:84%
and that is why I really
find myself excited

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:41.849 align:middle line:90%
about the whole enterprise.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.118 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Is there some
point that you shifted

00:04:44.118 --> 00:04:47.287 align:middle line:84%
after your studies or you've
always been thinking that way

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.657 align:middle line:84%
and yet you decided
to study science?

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:50.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: Yes.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.892 align:middle line:84%
You see like almost
all youngsters

00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:54.294 align:middle line:84%
of all religions you start
because in a traditional manner.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
You're born in a
particular family

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.065 align:middle line:84%
with a particular
religious tradition.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:00.134 align:middle line:84%
So you subscribe to it and
you dance about with it

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and you enjoy the colorful
narratives and do the liturgy

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.839 align:middle line:84%
and rituals and festivals and
it's all marvelous.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.942 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the journey
started, but when I was 15,

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.644 align:middle line:90%
I started to challenge this idea

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.613 align:middle line:84%
about a supreme personality
called God

00:05:12.613 --> 00:05:13.947 align:middle line:90%
who started the Creation.

00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.182 align:middle line:90%
I didn't agree.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:17.251 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't accept it
anymore so I started fighting

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.253 align:middle line:84%
with my father saying
there's no God.

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:20.454 align:middle line:90%
So I turned into an atheist.

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.822 align:middle line:90%
This is reality.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:24.091 align:middle line:84%
I was a crass atheist saying
this whole thing is nonsense,

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.994 align:middle line:84%
they put on old wives'
tales. It's not for real.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.396 align:middle line:84%
This religious enterprise
is nonsense.

00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:32.066 align:middle line:84%
So I had to fight with my
father almost regularly

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:33.667 align:middle line:90%
and he enjoyed it.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.302 align:middle line:84%
He smiled and would respond to
me.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:39.807 align:middle line:84%
So at that stage, at age of 15,
I was an atheist really and then

00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
when I became 16, 17, I
started to dig deeper.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.146 align:middle line:84%
So I said rather than focus
on ancient personalities

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:48.582 align:middle line:84%
of Hindu religion,
why not focus on modern

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.151 align:middle line:84%
spiritual personalities
of the Hindu tradition, see

00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.321 align:middle line:84%
if they make sense to me.
And here I discovered if you

00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:59.093 align:middle line:84%
like real treasure because
I discovered certain modern

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:03.397 align:middle line:84%
personalities who touched my
heart and captured my attention.

00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:04.832 align:middle line:90%
I'll give the names.

00:06:04.832 --> 00:06:07.701 align:middle line:84%
One was Ramana Maharshi
who lived in South India.

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.739 align:middle line:84%
Here you see an individual lit
up, something has touched him,

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:14.308 align:middle line:84%
something dramatic has happened
to him you can make out.

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:17.678 align:middle line:84%
There's no artificiality,
he's not selling any gimmicks,

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:20.948 align:middle line:84%
he's just, you know, established
in the real knowledge

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.216 align:middle line:90%
of the spirits.

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:24.284 align:middle line:84%
So you see this kind of
personality, but the personality

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.521 align:middle line:84%
that stole my heart is a
personality called Ramakrishna

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:33.427 align:middle line:84%
who lived in Bengal in the
1890s, 1880s I would say,

00:06:33.427 --> 00:06:36.497 align:middle line:84%
and his disciple Vivekananda,
really captured my attention

00:06:36.497 --> 00:06:38.732 align:middle line:84%
because here is a man who
had a similar journey.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.502 align:middle line:84%
He was an atheist in his
young days. He was in search

00:06:41.502 --> 00:06:44.438 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality, and he would
only accept spirituality

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:48.308 align:middle line:84%
if he discovered some individual
who could claim the spirituality

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.878 align:middle line:84%
as the matter of experience for
that person and wasn't a measure

00:06:50.878 --> 00:06:53.981 align:middle line:84%
of book learning or
intellectual acceptance.

00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So the journey that
Vivekananda took on of trying

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.686 align:middle line:84%
to discover some individual
who is absolutely, you know,

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:00.888 align:middle line:90%
embedded in the idea

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:02.389 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit, not
just intellectually

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.692 align:middle line:84%
but experientially is
what he was looking for,

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:07.027 align:middle line:90%
that's what I was looking for.

00:07:07.027 --> 00:07:08.762 align:middle line:84%
So found my mentor
in Ramakrishna, Vivekananda.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.032 align:middle line:84%
So I was studying at
the Imperial College

00:07:12.032 --> 00:07:14.601 align:middle line:84%
in Kensington here
just around the corner

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:17.471 align:middle line:84%
and while I was studying
physics I came across material,

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:20.374 align:middle line:84%
the literature of
Ramakrishna, Vivekananda

00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:22.042 align:middle line:84%
that gave me the
thrill of my life.

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:25.579 align:middle line:84%
It was the most life
transforming experience for me.

00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.314 align:middle line:84%
So studying the lectures,
et cetera,

00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:30.584 align:middle line:84%
of these two personalities were
not talking about spirituality

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:32.286 align:middle line:84%
from some kind of, you
know, book learning

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:36.690 align:middle line:84%
but actually first hand
encounter that image, you know,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.258 align:middle line:90%
that caught my attention.

00:07:38.258 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was studying
their lifestyle.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.028 align:middle line:90%
While I was doing physics,

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I was at the same time studying
spirituality represented

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.234 align:middle line:84%
in this modern format, the
rational format, a format

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:48.435 align:middle line:90%
that would appeal

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.737 align:middle line:84%
to a commonsensical
person like me, a youngster.

00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:54.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So never at any point
did it, was it counter,

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:59.146 align:middle line:84%
not counterintuitive, but just
saying two separate things.

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:00.514 align:middle line:90%
Science was saying one thing

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.316 align:middle line:84%
and your studies
were saying another?

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: No, no, in
fact to the contrary.

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I found that some of the issues
that science was struggling

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
with were better explored
by this deeper vision

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.958 align:middle line:90%
of religion or spirituality.

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.192 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you some examples.

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:15.863 align:middle line:84%
For example, this particular
juncture we are talking

00:08:15.863 --> 00:08:19.066 align:middle line:84%
about quantum physics being
very exciting enterprise and

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:22.402 align:middle line:84%
yet conceptually very
difficult to understand.

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I realized that what
spirituality is now telling us

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.043 align:middle line:84%
is gives you a conceptual grasp
of what quantum physics is all

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:32.211 align:middle line:84%
about, and this is the
heart of the matter.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.048 align:middle line:84%
It says that despite
appearances,

00:08:35.048 --> 00:08:37.951 align:middle line:84%
if you feel you can explain this
creation, this reality in terms

00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:41.889 align:middle line:84%
of matter and the epiphenomena
of matter means that attributes

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:44.057 align:middle line:84%
of matter if you can
just link those things

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:46.126 align:middle line:84%
up you can explain the
whole of this creation

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:49.363 align:middle line:84%
then quantum physics
says, no, it's not true.

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.698 align:middle line:84%
The underpinning to this
reality we guarantee

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:57.137 align:middle line:84%
to be known material and
matter is an outer appearance.

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:58.372 align:middle line:84%
This is, you know, Erwin
Schrodinger.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:01.575 align:middle line:84%
So this is dramatic material
to come out of physics

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.577 align:middle line:84%
which is now telling
the physicality

00:09:03.577 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of the physical world and
this fits extremely well

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.716 align:middle line:84%
with a deeper vision of religion
that comes with Hinduism saying

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
that the underpinning to this
reality is not material, it is

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.157 align:middle line:84%
essentially spirit
but when it manifests itself

00:09:17.157 --> 00:09:19.893 align:middle line:84%
at the first level,
it appears as matter.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:21.895 align:middle line:84%
But matter is an
appearance organized

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:25.165 align:middle line:84%
in tremendous resonance but
in quantum physics and what

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Hindu philosophy, esoteric Hindu

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.937 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, this is non-theistic
Hinduism. this is not, you

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:34.174 align:middle line:84%
know, supreme personality
setting the world into motion,

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:37.811 align:middle line:84%
but this is a very deeper vision
of what Hinduism is all about

00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:41.481 align:middle line:84%
and they set well with
each other extremely well.

00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: The people

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:45.018 align:middle line:84%
that represent sometimes
these religion

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:47.087 align:middle line:84%
or you were saying
Maharshi, you know,

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.389 align:middle line:84%
there's some controversy
sometimes

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.391 align:middle line:90%
about these people, right?

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.327 align:middle line:84%
For example I mean
from my understanding

00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:57.397 align:middle line:84%
or what I remember he had
created the transcendental

00:09:57.397 --> 00:09:58.699 align:middle line:90%
meditation, was that him?

00:09:58.699 --> 00:09:59.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani No, I think
you are mixing up.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I'm mixing
up with the --

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: No, I
tell you the one

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.405 align:middle line:84%
that influenced me was
Ramana Maharshi, and he never

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:07.741 align:middle line:84%
came out of India. He hardly
left his keoh.

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.309 align:middle line:90%
Completely different.

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:11.645 align:middle line:84%
Maharishi Mahesh is a different
cup of tea altogether

00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:12.679 align:middle line:84%
and I am not a fan
of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:15.482 align:middle line:90%
Quite frankly, I'm not a fan.

00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:19.419 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fan of Ramana Maharshi
who lived in South India

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:22.422 align:middle line:84%
and this is important
question that you raise.

00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:24.191 align:middle line:84%
The Hindu system
is an open system.

00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.126 align:middle line:84%
It's a very liberal
system and allows a variety

00:10:26.126 --> 00:10:28.028 align:middle line:84%
of different ways of
exploring spirituality.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:29.629 align:middle line:90%
It's the grand idea of Hinduism.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.132 align:middle line:84%
It's very majestic
and very open,

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:36.269 align:middle line:84%
but when you've got any open
system, it is open for abuse.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism has been abused in
no uncertain terms by not one,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.677 align:middle line:84%
but hundreds of people who
are either self-deluded,

00:10:43.677 --> 00:10:46.613 align:middle line:90%
they mean well but are deluded,

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:50.517 align:middle line:84%
and you know considering
meditation is pure daydreaming.

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:53.153 align:middle line:84%
They are self-deluded so
they come into the system

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and there are many who
are out to delude you.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.727 align:middle line:84%
So because it is an open system
it is definitely open to abuse

00:11:00.727 --> 00:11:04.564 align:middle line:84%
and Hindus pay a heavy
price for this openness.

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:08.035 align:middle line:84%
Lots of charlatans climb
the bandwagon of Hinduism

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:11.405 align:middle line:84%
and are promoting some gimmicks
or their own personality,

00:11:11.405 --> 00:11:14.007 align:middle line:84%
introducing cults and
this kind of, you know,

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.208 align:middle line:90%
very dangerous movement.

00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:17.444 align:middle line:90%
So we are open to that I agree,

00:11:17.444 --> 00:11:19.513 align:middle line:84%
but the names I am
promoting very blatantly

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:21.782 align:middle line:84%
and without any hesitation
is Ramana Maharshi who lived

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:26.486 align:middle line:84%
in South India and Paul Brunton
was often a constant visitor

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.687 align:middle line:84%
there and you can
see some marvelous, some

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:31.124 align:middle line:84%
of the discussions he
had with Ramana Maharshi

00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:34.094 align:middle line:84%
and the other two persons,
Ramakrishna

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:36.263 align:middle line:84%
who lived in Bengal in 1860s,
70s,

00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:38.331 align:middle line:84%
80s, and his disciple
Vivekananda.

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.101 align:middle line:84%
These are very famous
personalities.

00:11:41.101 --> 00:11:44.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But going back
to this aspect of religion

00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:47.474 align:middle line:84%
and how human beings are
kind of doing their own thing

00:11:47.474 --> 00:11:50.343 align:middle line:84%
with those precious,
ancient texts and it happens

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:53.346 align:middle line:84%
in all religions,
how can we go back?

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:56.049 align:middle line:84%
What is really the core and
the essence of all of them?

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.517 align:middle line:90%
Can we go back to that message?

00:11:57.517 --> 00:12:00.554 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like, you
know, it's been human beings

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:02.389 align:middle line:84%
after human beings
changing the text

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.858 align:middle line:84%
and making it whatever they
wanted and, unfortunately,

00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:08.328 align:middle line:84%
that's why we just don't
connect now with it.

00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:09.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: Indeed.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.631 align:middle line:84%
You see the thing is this. Let's
go to the heart of the matter.

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:15.802 align:middle line:84%
If you look at every mystical
tradition, every religion,

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:17.771 align:middle line:84%
at the heart of this
mystical tradition

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.508 align:middle line:84%
or religion would be some
individual, some personalities

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:25.412 align:middle line:84%
who are there because they
encountered the spirit

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:26.713 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.014 align:middle line:84%
They helped us phase with what
is underpinning this reality

00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:29.816 align:middle line:90%
including themselves.

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:32.385 align:middle line:84%
This has been very life
transforming experience

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:90%
They become prophets of mankind.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.991 align:middle line:84%
They become the leaders
of this particular field.

00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:39.526 align:middle line:90%
Now every society,

00:12:39.526 --> 00:12:42.229 align:middle line:84%
every civilization throughout
the ages have produced

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:44.231 align:middle line:90%
such personalities.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But for every 1 genuine there
may be 99 who are kind of, you

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.802 align:middle line:90%
know, getting on the bandwagon.

00:12:48.802 --> 00:12:51.371 align:middle line:84%
So there's always a risk, but
there are some individuals

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.807 align:middle line:84%
in the Christian tradition,
in the Sufi tradition,

00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:56.309 align:middle line:84%
in the Hindu tradition
you find marvelous,

00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:59.179 align:middle line:84%
you can see there is no
gimmick, there's no put on,

00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:01.381 align:middle line:84%
they're just completely
transformed

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.617 align:middle line:90%
and the litmus test is this

00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:06.887 align:middle line:84%
after the encounter, not only
are their lives transformed

00:13:06.887 --> 00:13:11.224 align:middle line:84%
for the better, the lives
of anybody they interact

00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:13.026 align:middle line:84%
with is transformed
for the better as well.

00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:14.394 align:middle line:84%
This is the proof
of the pudding.

00:13:14.394 --> 00:13:17.531 align:middle line:84%
If it's a charlatan,
somebody selling gimmicks,

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:19.599 align:middle line:84%
his life is not transformed,
he's just messing around

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.001 align:middle line:84%
and is going to mess
up the lives of a lot

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:25.338 align:middle line:84%
of other individuals, but the
genuine ones can light up

00:13:25.338 --> 00:13:30.243 align:middle line:84%
humanity, and around anybody who
comes into the circle

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.113 align:middle line:84%
of influence will be transformed
for the better forever.

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:34.481 align:middle line:90%
This is the proof of the pudding

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that something dramatic is
happening; it's not just a put

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
on and it's not just a wooly
staff because this is

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
where the science
logic kind of challenges

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.726 align:middle line:84%
the mystical ideas saying look,
it's all a matter of physics

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:49.696 align:middle line:84%
and it's all wooly and it's all
floaty stuff and you can put

00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:51.231 align:middle line:90%
on music and floating,

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.433 align:middle line:84%
you're on ground and stop all
this nonsense.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle line:84%
So they keep continue
to challenge,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.271 align:middle line:84%
understandably challenge this
kind of, you know, traditions,

00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:84%
but then you come across
certain individuals

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.442 align:middle line:84%
that are talking
from experience.

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:05.278 align:middle line:84%
You can see that they are lit
up and they've got the ability

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to light up anybody
who comes near them.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.949 align:middle line:84%
This is the proof
of the pudding.

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.386 align:middle line:84%
And the message at the core
of all religions you think

00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:17.090 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it seems
like the core of the core

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.459 align:middle line:84%
and the secret of it all
seems to be related to space

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:21.995 align:middle line:84%
and time also, which is
another conversation I would

00:14:21.995 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
like to have with you and I
don't know if you agree or not

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
but what is really at the
core of the heart of the heart

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.368 align:middle line:90%
of all those religious?

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:30.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: This is a very
beautiful question because I

00:14:30.837 --> 00:14:33.573 align:middle line:84%
like to develop this at
universities and I do a lot

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:37.043 align:middle line:84%
of talks at many post graduate
levels at many including Oxford.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:41.448 align:middle line:84%
I tell them this I said
this Hindu is insisting

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:44.751 align:middle line:84%
that at the experiential
level, not intellectual

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:47.787 align:middle line:84%
but at the experiential
level, every profit,

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:52.525 align:middle line:84%
every mystic hits the same
jackpot and always come

00:14:52.525 --> 00:14:54.527 align:middle line:84%
out of the experience
saying the experience was

00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:58.131 align:middle line:84%
such a wow experience that there
are no words to express it.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.134 align:middle line:84%
There's no way we can
articulate or use certain words

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:02.836 align:middle line:84%
to give expression to
what we have experienced.

00:15:02.836 --> 00:15:04.738 align:middle line:84%
This is beyond words,
transcendent,

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.873 align:middle line:90%
they use such word that's fine.

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:09.743 align:middle line:84%
The next moment this
is the great fun.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:12.178 align:middle line:84%
They will try and put their
experience into words.

00:15:12.178 --> 00:15:13.647 align:middle line:84%
They will try and
give expression

00:15:13.647 --> 00:15:16.416 align:middle line:84%
to what they say is
difficult to express.

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.284 align:middle line:90%
And why do they do that?

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.318 align:middle line:90%
Are they trying to compromise?

00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:20.186 align:middle line:90%
No. They love humanity.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:22.722 align:middle line:84%
Once you hit the
jackpot, you fall in love

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:23.857 align:middle line:90%
with the whole humanity.

00:15:23.857 --> 00:15:26.526 align:middle line:84%
You can't help yourself.
So now they want to pass

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:30.063 align:middle line:84%
on this thrilling, you know,
experience to rest of humanity.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:32.465 align:middle line:84%
So they'll use every
ploy, they'll squirm,

00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:34.534 align:middle line:84%
they'll use every
ploy to put across

00:15:34.534 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
or give expression
to their experience.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.905 align:middle line:90%
Now here the fun begins.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:40.974 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting and
I'm insisting upon it.

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.776 align:middle line:84%
Suppose Christ goes
into the wilderness

00:15:42.776 --> 00:15:46.913 align:middle line:84%
and comes back a transformed
person and he's interacting

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:49.616 align:middle line:84%
with greater society
what does he say?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.519 align:middle line:84%
He says I encountered
the father in heaven.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:55.221 align:middle line:84%
That particular mindset
of the words he uses,

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:58.925 align:middle line:84%
the vocabulary he uses reflects
his own mindset and the mindset

00:15:58.925 --> 00:16:00.193 align:middle line:84%
of the people he is
interacting with.

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:01.628 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be otherwise.

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of the
spirit becomes visible

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:07.567 align:middle line:84%
at this great super personality
in the heaven as a father figure

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:10.236 align:middle line:84%
and you may smile but see this
is how he gives expression

00:16:10.236 --> 00:16:12.339 align:middle line:90%
to his spiritual experience.

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:15.175 align:middle line:84%
Then Buddha sits under the bodhi
tree,

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:17.377 align:middle line:90%
gets thriiled, hits the jackpot,

00:16:17.377 --> 00:16:19.112 align:middle line:84%
and does he say he's
met the father in heaven?

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:21.214 align:middle line:90%
No, he says I'm enlightened.

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:22.816 align:middle line:84%
He says you will
become enlightened.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:24.818 align:middle line:90%
It's different expression.

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:28.722 align:middle line:84%
Every mystic, every
great personality,

00:16:28.722 --> 00:16:31.791 align:middle line:84%
spiritual personality
has the same problem.

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.427 align:middle line:84%
They experience this
transcendent beyond words

00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:37.797 align:middle line:84%
and they try and articulate in
the best, they don't compromise,

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:40.934 align:middle line:84%
they just love humanity so they
want to give expression to it

00:16:40.934 --> 00:16:43.269 align:middle line:84%
so they'll use the mindset
they possess themselves.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.004 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be otherwise.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:46.539 align:middle line:84%
In the minds of the
people they are interacting

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.308 align:middle line:90%
with how can they communicate?

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:50.877 align:middle line:84%
All this will kick in and
this is why you have the same

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:52.679 align:middle line:84%
experience given
different expressions

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.047 align:middle line:90%
or different religions.

00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:55.248 align:middle line:90%
So the heart of every religion

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:58.685 align:middle line:84%
as you said quite rightly
is the same fountainhead

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.187 align:middle line:84%
but when this particular,
you know, when it flows out,

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:84%
it comes out in different
colors because when you try

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.493 align:middle line:84%
and give expression we
are unfortunately stuck

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:10.163 align:middle line:84%
with the language we use
in order to articulate this

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:13.198 align:middle line:84%
and that then, of course,
we see a variation.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.002 align:middle line:84%
Same experience, different
expressions.

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.638 align:middle line:84%
So this is like the
reconciliation of a multitude

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:20.372 align:middle line:90%
of religious world views.

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.775 align:middle line:90%
This is one aspect.

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:23.042 align:middle line:90%
The fun part is this, okay,

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.945 align:middle line:84%
so we can say there are
multiple religious expressions

00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.947 align:middle line:84%
and, Mr. Lakhani, you meant it
reconciles... well, maybe you're

00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:31.718 align:middle line:84%
right, maybe it's not right, but
so be it,

00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:33.019 align:middle line:84%
but what about the
science chaps?

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:35.155 align:middle line:84%
Because they are saying we don't
like this spirit stuff.

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:36.389 align:middle line:84%
The only spirit we
believe in comes

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.058 align:middle line:90%
in bottles during Christmastime.

00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:39.359 align:middle line:90%
So what is all of this?

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:42.695 align:middle line:84%
How do reconcile a science
oriented rational world view

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:45.832 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of very high
flying spiritual world view?

00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The answer is this, it is the
integrity of modern science

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.907 align:middle line:84%
that is now very clearly
pointing at a deeper dimension

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:58.845 align:middle line:84%
to reality so they are no
longer fixated on the externals.

00:17:58.845 --> 00:18:01.114 align:middle line:84%
So it's modern science and the
integrity of modern science

00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.116 align:middle line:84%
that is now again prompting a
deeper vision

00:18:03.116 --> 00:18:05.752 align:middle line:90%
regarding what this reality is

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:09.422 align:middle line:84%
all about and this is again
resonating extremely well

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:84%
with the prophets
we're talking about.

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.494 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to express
it in their own limited way,

00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:17.831 align:middle line:84%
in a very, you know,
anthropologic manner but here

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
through science we did non
kind of personality oriented,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.004 align:middle line:84%
it's principle oriented
enterprise is now, again,

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:27.407 align:middle line:84%
pointing out a deeper
dimension to reality,

00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:28.675 align:middle line:90%
which is very thrilling.

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.977 align:middle line:84%
So, I tell youngsters, I say if
you want to be spiritual,

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
you can say can I study
the Bag-- Hindu?

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.215 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, look my friends.

00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Study the science of today.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.687 align:middle line:84%
If you are genuine about
spirituality, study,

00:18:40.687 --> 00:18:43.356 align:middle line:84%
if you like the cutting edge
discoveries of modern physics

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:46.359 align:middle line:84%
or modern neuroscience.
You'll hit the same jackpot

00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:48.261 align:middle line:84%
that the prophets
hit through meditation

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:49.596 align:middle line:90%
and through various enterprises.

00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:53.099 align:middle line:84%
So, it is a science of today
that will lead not hundreds

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:84%
but thousands and millions
of people on the path

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:59.405 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality without
a prescriptive religion.

00:18:59.405 --> 00:19:02.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Sciences is
very precise, right?

00:19:02.008 --> 00:19:05.645 align:middle line:84%
Whereas what you just said is
these people had a hard time

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:06.613 align:middle line:90%
to put it in words.

00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:08.715 align:middle line:90%
So how can those two meet?

00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:11.217 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Yes, the thing
is what I'm saying is

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:14.621 align:middle line:84%
that we do not need to verify
the religious enterprise.

00:19:14.621 --> 00:19:17.123 align:middle line:84%
We see it as a limited
attempt to try

00:19:17.123 --> 00:19:19.192 align:middle line:84%
and articulate a very
difficult subject.

00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:21.861 align:middle line:84%
So, there's nothing wrong
with any of these prophets,

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:24.297 align:middle line:84%
I love them all, they are lovely
chaps trying to do a good job.

00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:25.999 align:middle line:84%
They love because
they hit the jackpot

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.834 align:middle line:84%
and that's what life
is all about.

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:29.335 align:middle line:84%
So they are trying to give
expression

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.939 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of humanity
and they are struggling.

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:35.375 align:middle line:84%
But now, without the prophets,
without the God sitting

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.511 align:middle line:84%
in heaven, science itself is
saying look, there's more to you

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.480 align:middle line:84%
than meets the eye.
See, yes? Oh, yes! See,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.616 align:middle line:84%
in neuroscience they'll say you
see Mr. Lakhani the hard problem

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.119 align:middle line:84%
for neuroscience is
called consciousness.

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:48.655 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the heck
it is, where it comes from,

00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:50.657 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be everywhere
and nowhere

00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:53.459 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know what it is
and then we've got this kind of,

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:56.729 align:middle line:84%
then it's writing
textbooks to explain it away

00:19:56.729 --> 00:20:01.367 align:middle line:84%
but they are just throwing a
jumble of jargon in your face

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.336 align:middle line:84%
but they're not really
explaining what consciousness

00:20:03.336 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.371 align:middle line:84%
Can you kindly throw
light on it?

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.274 align:middle line:84%
I said it is light my
friend, it is light.

00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:11.444 align:middle line:84%
[Laughter] But this is
how we see the integrity

00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:15.548 align:middle line:84%
of modern science, physical
sciences with the life sciences

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
which are now clearly,
I'm suggesting

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and strongly promoting
the idea, of pointing

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper dimension to
reality that's been rediscovered

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:27.527 align:middle line:84%
through the integrity of science
not through any prophets,

00:20:27.527 --> 00:20:30.096 align:middle line:90%
the integrity is non-personal,

00:20:30.096 --> 00:20:32.732 align:middle line:84%
it's not a personality orienting
the subject, it's a principle

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:36.536 align:middle line:84%
in the subject is finding the
same thing without the tops

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and tails of religion.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.271 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:39.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: So be it.

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:42.709 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Some people try to
find the God atom, you know.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: The God particle?

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.546 align:middle line:84%
The God particle actually
the name was a mistake.

00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:50.683 align:middle line:84%
When they were actually trying
to finish the jigsaw puzzle

00:20:50.683 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:84%
of elementary particles and
these particles are tricky.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.056 align:middle line:84%
They were calling God damn it
particles, it's difficult

00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:58.224 align:middle line:90%
to find.

00:20:58.224 --> 00:20:59.626 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly they made a mistake, it
became God particle.

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:02.362 align:middle line:84%
This particle doesn't prove God
or disprove God. It has nothing

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:03.663 align:middle line:84%
to do with the poor chap. Leave
him alone.

00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It's simply part of a jigsaw
puzzle, which was puzzling

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.969 align:middle line:84%
so it was called God Damn It and
disappeared

00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:12.672 align:middle line:84%
and became God particle and
turned

00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:14.307 align:middle line:90%
into a major kind of, you know,

00:21:14.307 --> 00:21:17.844 align:middle line:84%
science and religion meet.
They're not meeting up at all.

00:21:17.844 --> 00:21:21.314 align:middle line:84%
Science, with its own integrity,
suggests talking about how we

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:24.384 align:middle line:84%
can try and explain the reality
through using this jigsaw puzzle

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:27.487 align:middle line:84%
of elementary particles and
one particle was called this

00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
boson that was missing
is now they say it has been

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.425 align:middle line:84%
discovered through the Hadron
Collider,

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:84%
but the thing doesn't make
any difference to ideas

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.831 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality or
of science either.

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:41.968 align:middle line:84%
It just basically filling
the gap in the jigsaw puzzle.

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.503 align:middle line:90%
That's all it's done.

00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:45.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So what
is essential to know

00:21:45.905 --> 00:21:51.444 align:middle line:84%
or where is exactly this quantum
physics and the cutting edge

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:54.647 align:middle line:84%
as you say physics
are pointing at?

00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:58.317 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear of the black
holes, we hear of energy and all

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:02.488 align:middle line:84%
of it seems to be, you know,
we're all energy and invisible

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
so tell us in your own words,
you know, what it looks like.

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Okay, first
of all because you touched

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.296 align:middle line:84%
on the words space and time,
et cetera, let me just focus

00:22:10.296 --> 00:22:12.565 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm going to say next.

00:22:12.565 --> 00:22:15.201 align:middle line:84%
You see because what's happened
I just show you how science

00:22:15.201 --> 00:22:17.804 align:middle line:84%
and religion link at
a very deep level.

00:22:17.804 --> 00:22:20.606 align:middle line:84%
Now my mentorVivekananda
was in London in 1896

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:22.341 align:middle line:84%
and he gave a lecture
here called Absolute

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.543 align:middle line:90%
and Manifestations saying

00:22:23.543 --> 00:22:26.345 align:middle line:84%
that how can the spirit
become this visible world

00:22:26.345 --> 00:22:28.681 align:middle line:84%
that we are sure about
in front of our eyes?

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:32.785 align:middle line:84%
I mean how does the
transition take place?

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:36.456 align:middle line:84%
Now you may be surprised at
what he said in 1896 in London

00:22:36.456 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
with what we have discovered

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.093 align:middle line:84%
or what we call now
the Big Bang Theory.

00:22:40.093 --> 00:22:42.495 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
the crux of it.

00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:45.098 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang Theory basically
using the integrity of science

00:22:45.098 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Hubble Telescope have
discovered that all galaxies

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.768 align:middle line:84%
in every direction are running
away from you

00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:51.504 align:middle line:90%
at a faster and faster speed.

00:22:51.504 --> 00:22:54.006 align:middle line:84%
So they said why don't we run
the film backwards?

00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:57.043 align:middle line:84%
So we run the film backwards all
the galaxies come together

00:22:57.043 --> 00:23:02.115 align:middle line:84%
at one point and that would
take, what, 37 billion years?

00:23:02.115 --> 00:23:04.851 align:middle line:84%
But then the whole thing
collapses and comes to a big,

00:23:04.851 --> 00:23:06.986 align:middle line:84%
this is the beginning
of creation.

00:23:06.986 --> 00:23:10.223 align:middle line:84%
So they say, ah, we discovered
the story of creation.

00:23:10.223 --> 00:23:12.024 align:middle line:84%
There's no gold city
in the heaven.

00:23:12.024 --> 00:23:14.494 align:middle line:90%
Basically space and time unfold.

00:23:14.494 --> 00:23:16.729 align:middle line:84%
There is no bang as such
but space and time unfold

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:20.433 align:middle line:84%
like folded up and
they unfold and when space

00:23:20.433 --> 00:23:23.369 align:middle line:84%
and time unfold, creation
comes into being.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:26.973 align:middle line:84%
So there are two dimensions to
reality that are space and time.

00:23:26.973 --> 00:23:29.442 align:middle line:84%
When they unfold,
creation comes into being.

00:23:29.442 --> 00:23:30.977 align:middle line:90%
So far so good.

00:23:30.977 --> 00:23:32.745 align:middle line:90%
A question still remained.

00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:36.916 align:middle line:84%
Who pressed the button for
space and time to unfold?

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.785 align:middle line:84%
So the religious people get into
the lobby saying yeah, God.

00:23:38.785 --> 00:23:41.754 align:middle line:84%
God did that, so God pressed the
button and the Big Bang started,

00:23:41.754 --> 00:23:44.757 align:middle line:84%
so God is still okay.
God is safe.

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
In reality, God is
still not safe.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.262 align:middle line:84%
Vivekananda in 1896 in the
lecture, and I was studying at

00:23:49.262 --> 00:23:52.165 align:middle line:84%
Imperial College, while I was
studying physics,

00:23:52.165 --> 00:23:53.566 align:middle line:90%
said the following.

00:23:53.566 --> 00:23:56.469 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed. This was before
Hubble telescope, before

00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.172 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, before Newton, not
before him but before Einstein,

00:23:59.172 --> 00:24:01.474 align:middle line:84%
he said three things unfold for
creation to come into being,

00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:04.043 align:middle line:84%
not two, and it's got nothing
to do with space and time.

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:06.813 align:middle line:84%
The Big Bang Theory
is unheard of in 1896.

00:24:06.813 --> 00:24:09.982 align:middle line:84%
He said three things unfold for
creation to come into being.

00:24:09.982 --> 00:24:11.217 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed. I though, three
things?

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:13.519 align:middle line:84%
I thought elementary
particles? What is three things?

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:15.788 align:middle line:90%
This is what he said.

00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.857 align:middle line:84%
He said desa, kala, nimitta. We
say Sanskrit,

00:24:17.857 --> 00:24:20.626 align:middle line:84%
we say
space, time, and causation

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:22.895 align:middle line:84%
When they unfold,
creation comes into being.

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:25.965 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed by this man's,
you know, kind of insight

00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:28.000 align:middle line:90%
into nature of reality.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.504 align:middle line:84%
So when I studied the Big Bang
Theory, which is much later

00:24:31.504 --> 00:24:35.241 align:middle line:84%
and it came into being just
literally 50 years ago,

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.877 align:middle line:84%
When I was studying the Big Bang
Theory, I said this is amazing

00:24:37.877 --> 00:24:40.112 align:middle line:84%
because one question the Big
Bang Theory

00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:42.682 align:middle line:90%
has not answered is this,

00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:46.219 align:middle line:84%
if you ask Steven Hawking, "What
was there before the Big Bang?"

00:24:46.219 --> 00:24:49.121 align:middle line:84%
He would say in his lovely way,
"Don't ask the silly question.

00:24:49.121 --> 00:24:51.123 align:middle line:84%
There was no time, so the
question is irrelevant,

00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:52.859 align:middle line:84%
so don't ask what
was before Big Bang

00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:54.327 align:middle line:90%
because there was no before.

00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:57.263 align:middle line:84%
Time came with the Big Bang, so
stop asking silly questions."

00:24:57.263 --> 00:24:59.498 align:middle line:84%
If you ask Steven
Hawking who caused

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:02.802 align:middle line:84%
or what caused the Big
Bang, what's the causation?

00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:06.038 align:middle line:84%
He'll say I don't know,
but Vivekananda comes

00:25:06.038 --> 00:25:08.908 align:middle line:84%
with answer. He said three
things unfold not two.

00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:11.077 align:middle line:84%
Causation comes with
the Big Bang.

00:25:11.077 --> 00:25:13.379 align:middle line:84%
So if you had to ask
who caused the Big Bang,

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.382 align:middle line:84%
that question is irrelevant
because there was no causation

00:25:16.382 --> 00:25:19.819 align:middle line:84%
so it's spontaneous without
need for a God, without need

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:21.921 align:middle line:84%
for what caused the Big
Bang comes through if

00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:24.724 align:middle line:84%
like the deeper vision
of religion space, time,

00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:27.793 align:middle line:84%
causation unfolding for this
creation to come into being.

00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:30.730 align:middle line:84%
See, when idea of cause and
effect comes with the Big Bang,

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.999 align:middle line:84%
so you can't say who caused
or what caused the Big Bang,

00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:33.799 align:middle line:90%
who pressed the button.

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:34.967 align:middle line:90%
You can't ask that question.

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.335 align:middle line:90%
It's irrelevant.

00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:39.272 align:middle line:84%
So you see I'm showing you how
the deeper vision that comes

00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:42.074 align:middle line:84%
out of religious lobby
kind of not only sits well

00:25:42.074 --> 00:25:44.143 align:middle line:84%
with modern science, in
fact, it gives answers to

00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:46.879 align:middle line:84%
what modern science sometimes is
not able to sort out.

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:48.347 align:middle line:84%
So this is a beautiful
idea of how space,

00:25:48.347 --> 00:25:50.283 align:middle line:84%
time and causation
is the beginning

00:25:50.283 --> 00:25:51.751 align:middle line:90%
of the whole of this creation.

00:25:51.751 --> 00:25:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, and that space
and time are not limited, right?

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.825 align:middle line:84%
I feel this is the biggest
trap right now that we're

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:02.295 align:middle line:84%
in like it stresses
us doesn't it?

00:26:02.295 --> 00:26:05.264 align:middle line:84%
I mean in places like London,
boy, we're running after time,

00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:08.734 align:middle line:90%
after space, after all of it.

00:26:08.734 --> 00:26:11.837 align:middle line:90%
This is a big suffering here.

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:13.039 align:middle line:90%
This is not the truth.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:16.309 align:middle line:84%
It's like the truth
has been misplaced.

00:26:16.309 --> 00:26:18.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Space, time and
causation basically are if you

00:26:18.778 --> 00:26:20.246 align:middle line:90%
like the intricate dimensions

00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.882 align:middle line:84%
in which the creation
can manifest itself.

00:26:22.882 --> 00:26:26.485 align:middle line:84%
So, the idea and absolute
manifestation the first level

00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of space, time and causation are

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.323 align:middle line:84%
like the first level
of manifestation.

00:26:30.323 --> 00:26:32.758 align:middle line:84%
What is manifested, what appears
in space, time, causation if you

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:38.864 align:middle line:84%
like, the secondary level and
then you can see matter coming

00:26:38.864 --> 00:26:43.703 align:middle line:84%
into being. This is the
second stage of creation then

00:26:43.703 --> 00:26:45.972 align:middle line:84%
in the material world,
this is where I come

00:26:45.972 --> 00:26:49.742 align:middle line:84%
to what you just said, whenever
we see a living thing buzzing

00:26:49.742 --> 00:26:52.712 align:middle line:84%
even bacteria single-celled
being, the very thing

00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:55.781 align:middle line:84%
that was underpinning
reality which manifests itself

00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.717 align:middle line:84%
as the material
world is now trying

00:26:57.717 --> 00:27:00.519 align:middle line:84%
to find greater way
of expressing itself.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:03.055 align:middle line:84%
So when you see some
DNA coming together,

00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:06.492 align:middle line:84%
some molecules coming together,
we don't say it's accidental.

00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We say the thing that's
underpinning is trying

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.462 align:middle line:90%
to find better expression.

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:11.564 align:middle line:84%
So the material world
is not good enough.

00:27:11.564 --> 00:27:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It comes visible
as living thing.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.169 align:middle line:84%
If this particular
manifestation continues

00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:21.874 align:middle line:84%
to become much more elaborate
until it hits this human frame

00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:23.509 align:middle line:84%
so the same things trying to
express itself as

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:26.278 align:middle line:84%
a living thing
becomes most transparent,

00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:28.981 align:middle line:90%
most visible as humanity.

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.585 align:middle line:84%
So the clearest vision of God
on earth or the clearest vision

00:27:32.585 --> 00:27:33.886 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, someone
said what's spirit?

00:27:33.886 --> 00:27:36.288 align:middle line:84%
I said don't you see?
Look in the mirror.

00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:38.457 align:middle line:84%
You are the clearest
vision of the spirit.

00:27:38.457 --> 00:27:41.861 align:middle line:84%
Man and women are the
clearest image of God on earth.

00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:43.195 align:middle line:90%
Not one man, the whole

00:27:43.195 --> 00:27:45.965 align:middle line:84%
of humanity is the
clearest manifestation

00:27:45.965 --> 00:27:47.266 align:middle line:90%
of what is underpinning.

00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:48.567 align:middle line:84%
It expresses material world;
space, time, causation.

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:53.339 align:middle line:84%
In the material world, the
buzzing that you see is, if you

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:84%
like, spirit percolating,
coming through more clearly,

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.846 align:middle line:84%
and humanity is the best
expression of the spirit.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.783 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: At the same
time our body dissolve

00:28:03.783 --> 00:28:05.751 align:middle line:84%
and we're here only
a certain time

00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:09.255 align:middle line:90%
and so where is this really?

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:12.291 align:middle line:84%
We stress and we have
emotions and all of this.

00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.326 align:middle line:90%
So, where do we look at?

00:28:14.326 --> 00:28:15.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: We look
at many places.

00:28:15.995 --> 00:28:19.799 align:middle line:84%
For example, the India tradition
means Hinduism, Buddhism,

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Chinese, some say

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.436 align:middle line:84%
your journey doesn't
stop when the body dies.

00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Death is seen as a comma and not
a full stop in the tradition.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.376 align:middle line:84%
So if you say what happens when
the body dies and you dissolve

00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:31.911 align:middle line:84%
and your body, you dissolve it
or you burn it, what happens?

00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:34.947 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing that is
underpinning has not lost

00:28:34.947 --> 00:28:37.316 align:middle line:90%
its journey.

00:28:37.316 --> 00:28:41.821 align:middle line:84%
It continues the journey, it
manifests itself in another body

00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:44.557 align:middle line:84%
until it discovers what you
said why does it continue

00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:45.858 align:middle line:90%
to be reborn?

00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:47.726 align:middle line:90%
Why does it bother?

00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:48.494 align:middle line:90%
You've got the drives.

00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:49.895 align:middle line:90%
Now, again, when you want

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:52.298 align:middle line:84%
suss out the human condition,
it's not only the physical world

00:28:52.298 --> 00:28:54.567 align:middle line:84%
that you look at but
you look at inner man.

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:59.672 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all have lots of drives,
lots of emotions and we see

00:28:59.672 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
if you like appear to be kind
of, you know, unfulfillable,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.346 align:middle line:84%
difficult to fulfill and
a continuous struggle

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:08.681 align:middle line:90%
to find expression

00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:11.584 align:middle line:84%
or to resolve our human
condition or fulfill desires.

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:14.453 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is if you like the
reason why we continue the

00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:16.355 align:middle line:90%
journey of reincarnation.

00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:19.925 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is trying to
get fulfillment struggles

00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:22.294 align:middle line:84%
in one lifetime so it
tries to get fulfillment

00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:25.397 align:middle line:84%
in the second life or the next
life and carries on the journey

00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and the only way this
fulfillment comes

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and the reason this will
continue, the only resolution

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.439 align:middle line:90%
of this human dilemma is

00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
when the individual rediscovers
its essential nature, not

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
as a material being chasing
after material objectives

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.982 align:middle line:90%
but a spiritual being.

00:29:42.982 --> 00:29:46.685 align:middle line:84%
So once it discovers that I am
the spirit. Again, this is

00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:48.854 align:middle line:90%
experiential, not

00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:50.055 align:middle line:84%
intellectual. "Oh, I believe
that!" doesn't help you.

00:29:50.055 --> 00:29:51.624 align:middle line:84%
Your desires are still going
to come and bother you.

00:29:51.624 --> 00:29:54.326 align:middle line:84%
So when you experience that you
are the spirit, you are full

00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:57.029 align:middle line:84%
and resplendent, there's
nothing missing in you,

00:29:57.029 --> 00:30:00.432 align:middle line:84%
then desires fall away, then
no more reincarnation.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So then the human condition
has been resolved permanently

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.906 align:middle line:84%
because then you say
I am full. What desires?

00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:09.875 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to fight desires.
They don't bother me anymore.

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:10.709 align:middle line:90%
They fall off.

00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:12.211 align:middle line:90%
If you look at every prophet,

00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:14.079 align:middle line:84%
this is what happens
in the lives.

00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:15.581 align:middle line:90%
You see desires drop off.

00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:18.584 align:middle line:84%
It's not better to fight it and
bottle it up.

00:30:18.584 --> 00:30:20.386 align:middle line:84%
They just disappear.
They just fizzle away.

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:24.623 align:middle line:84%
They discover their real nature
in the spirit so the resolution

00:30:24.623 --> 00:30:26.592 align:middle line:90%
of the human condition is not

00:30:26.592 --> 00:30:28.827 align:middle line:84%
in the material level
it's a spiritual level

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:32.898 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover our identity
as spirit, and once you do

00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:35.768 align:middle line:84%
that, the journey comes
to a halt in a nice manner.

00:30:35.768 --> 00:30:38.971 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you, you know,
lose your individuality.

00:30:38.971 --> 00:30:41.674 align:middle line:84%
You discover your individuality,
you are the spirit,

00:30:41.674 --> 00:30:43.275 align:middle line:90%
my friend, you are that.

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.244 align:middle line:84%
That's what humanity
is studying up to do.

00:30:45.244 --> 00:30:47.279 align:middle line:84%
It does it through its
various methods of trying

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill wishes, trying to
chase after pleasurable things.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.051 align:middle line:84%
So, all these hedonistic
pursuits

00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:53.686 align:middle line:84%
that we see are not to be
villified.

00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:56.922 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to find
expression of fulfillment

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:90%
through this hedonistic journey.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.758 align:middle line:90%
I like pleasurable things.

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:02.261 align:middle line:90%
Why not? No, why? Really, why?

00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:03.696 align:middle line:90%
This is his journey.

00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:05.264 align:middle line:84%
It's only when it gets whacked
left and right

00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:06.865 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly something is wrong
here.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:07.666 align:middle line:90%
Then he says something...

00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:08.867 align:middle line:90%
I need to find a better way.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.736 align:middle line:84%
So you say, oh, I must
chase after this objective

00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:12.404 align:middle line:84%
or that objective and
you get that objective

00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.006 align:middle line:90%
and three more desires arise.

00:31:14.006 --> 00:31:15.341 align:middle line:90%
So where do they come from?

00:31:15.341 --> 00:31:17.309 align:middle line:84%
You fulfill them and three
more arise, thirty more arise

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.011 align:middle line:84%
and you say this is
getting out of hand.

00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:21.413 align:middle line:84%
So when the maturity arises
something is wrong here,

00:31:21.413 --> 00:31:23.816 align:middle line:84%
we've been chasing
after shadows.

00:31:23.816 --> 00:31:25.684 align:middle line:84%
When the maturity
comes naturally,

00:31:25.684 --> 00:31:27.853 align:middle line:84%
it's not by a guru saying
oh, don't do this,

00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:29.622 align:middle line:90%
Stop your desire! It won't work.

00:31:29.622 --> 00:31:31.023 align:middle line:90%
When the maturity comes

00:31:31.023 --> 00:31:33.892 align:middle line:84%
from within. I know something is
seriously wrong here I've been

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:37.196 align:middle line:84%
chasing and biting at shadows,
and I'm not getting fulfilled.

00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:37.997 align:middle line:90%
So what is the reason?

00:31:37.997 --> 00:31:39.798 align:middle line:90%
When that starting up comes,

00:31:39.798 --> 00:31:42.401 align:middle line:84%
then you become truly
interested in spiritualty.

00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:43.736 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you're
just tokenistic.

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:45.137 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:45.137 --> 00:31:47.239 align:middle line:84%
It feels like once
there's this recognition

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:49.375 align:middle line:90%
that we are spirit then related

00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:53.178 align:middle line:84%
to this time/space conversation
then it's not even a

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%
conversation anymore.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Space
and time again follow

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:00.552 align:middle line:84%
because the spirit is not
something that is singular

00:32:00.552 --> 00:32:03.222 align:middle line:84%
or plural, it's not in
this part of the location

00:32:03.222 --> 00:32:05.557 align:middle line:84%
because people say Mr. Lakhani,
if we are spirit,

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:06.825 align:middle line:84%
which part of the
universe are we?

00:32:06.825 --> 00:32:09.328 align:middle line:84%
I said don't you see the
university is in you, not you,

00:32:09.328 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
so you don't find
yourself here or there.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.467 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in this idea
of spirit, it underpins all

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:19.505 align:middle line:84%
of reality, all of space,
all of time, whole cosmos.

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:21.707 align:middle line:84%
If you are underpinning,
you can't say where am I?

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:23.676 align:middle line:84%
You are everywhere
and nowhere really.

00:32:23.676 --> 00:32:26.011 align:middle line:84%
You aren't in any
individual object and

00:32:26.011 --> 00:32:28.080 align:middle line:84%
yet you underpin the
whole of this creation.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.216 align:middle line:84%
Again, it sounds very nice
and artistic and, you know,

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:33.585 align:middle line:84%
poetic, but really
what I'm saying is you need

00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:34.987 align:middle line:90%
to experience it.

00:32:34.987 --> 00:32:37.089 align:middle line:90%
Look at the lives of prophets.

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:39.224 align:middle line:84%
They live as if they
own the whole universe

00:32:39.224 --> 00:32:41.126 align:middle line:90%
and desire nothing from it.

00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:43.128 align:middle line:90%
This is the sign of a prophett.

00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:45.364 align:middle line:84%
They seem..they walk about with
the majest

00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:48.367 align:middle line:84%
of a real master
of the universe and

00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:51.737 align:middle line:84%
yet there are not desires of
any aspect of this master.

00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:53.339 align:middle line:90%
They don't own this or that.

00:32:53.339 --> 00:32:56.241 align:middle line:84%
They walk like real masters
otherwise they become slaves.

00:32:56.241 --> 00:32:59.778 align:middle line:84%
If desires infect them,
they're no better than us.

00:32:59.778 --> 00:33:03.015 align:middle line:84%
The desires drop off and they
live a very masterful life.

00:33:03.015 --> 00:33:04.249 align:middle line:90%
Look at their lives.

00:33:04.249 --> 00:33:06.051 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't charge you up,
nothing else will.

00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:07.319 align:middle line:84%
People say should I be
studying philosophy?

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
No, no, I said study the
lives of recent personalities

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.426 align:middle line:84%
that attract you who are
spiritually oriented.

00:33:14.426 --> 00:33:17.396 align:middle line:84%
Just look at their lives,
this is very personal,

00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.898 align:middle line:84%
very anthropocentric so you're
looking at human condition

00:33:19.898 --> 00:33:22.134 align:middle line:84%
and human resolution
and look at the lives.

00:33:22.134 --> 00:33:24.002 align:middle line:84%
See if it doesn't capture
you, nothing else will.

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:25.437 align:middle line:90%
Philosophy comes afterwards.

00:33:25.437 --> 00:33:29.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The oneness, a lot of
people speak of this oneness,

00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.911 align:middle line:84%
do you think this is something
that's related to coming back

00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:35.147 align:middle line:84%
to our spirit, right,
and to understand

00:33:35.147 --> 00:33:39.618 align:middle line:90%
that we are all interconnected?

00:33:39.618 --> 00:33:42.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Again, the
spirit is never plural,

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:43.389 align:middle line:90%
it is always singular.

00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:45.791 align:middle line:84%
It's not that my spirit is
different from your spirit.

00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:48.427 align:middle line:84%
The thing that is looking out
through my eyes and bubbling

00:33:48.427 --> 00:33:50.863 align:middle line:84%
up through this particular
frame is also bubbling

00:33:50.863 --> 00:33:52.531 align:middle line:84%
out through that
particular frame.

00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.368 align:middle line:84%
So the link that I have with
other humanity, it's not

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:59.338 align:middle line:84%
at the material level as Dawkins
would suggest but at the deeper,

00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
spiritual level we
are linked up.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.740 align:middle line:90%
So that is why, you know,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.177 align:middle line:84%
this is again a very
interesting litmus test.

00:34:05.177 --> 00:34:07.412 align:middle line:84%
The reason why all the prophets
were in love with humanity is

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:09.782 align:middle line:84%
because they were... actually
experienced that oneness

00:34:09.782 --> 00:34:11.383 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of humanity.

00:34:11.383 --> 00:34:13.117 align:middle line:90%
They see themselves reflected

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:14.952 align:middle line:84%
in other human beings
so they are stuck.

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:16.789 align:middle line:90%
You see they want to express.

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:20.025 align:middle line:84%
So the same is true with this
oneness is something, again,

00:34:20.025 --> 00:34:24.430 align:middle line:84%
if you look at some of the
modern mystic poets they will

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.164 align:middle line:84%
talk about the same thing
without the tops and turns

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:29.068 align:middle line:84%
of religion. They will
say a great peace seems

00:34:29.068 --> 00:34:30.202 align:middle line:90%
to descend on us.

00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:32.905 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be one with
the whole of creation.

00:34:32.905 --> 00:34:35.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a sign of a
spiritual experience.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Like Rumi, who was
great.

00:34:36.642 --> 00:34:39.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Rumi or lots of
other, you know, William Blake,

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.847 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them when they talk of
this Wadsworth, when they talk

00:34:41.847 --> 00:34:43.816 align:middle line:84%
of this oneness, you can
feel they're feeling it

00:34:43.816 --> 00:34:45.651 align:middle line:90%
with whole of creation.

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.952 align:middle line:84%
When you see that
visible in their poetry

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:52.024 align:middle line:84%
or in the literature, when you
read it, it gives you a thrill

00:34:52.024 --> 00:34:53.959 align:middle line:84%
because some of that thing
is passed on to you

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:55.694 align:middle line:84%
through that particular
vocabulary.

00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:57.863 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, this
oneness is something.

00:34:57.863 --> 00:34:59.932 align:middle line:84%
Again, the only way
you'll overcome, you know,

00:34:59.932 --> 00:35:02.468 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about earlier
about fear is when you say

00:35:02.468 --> 00:35:05.037 align:middle line:84%
that I am one with whole
creation how can you be fearful

00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:05.871 align:middle line:90%
of anything?

00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:07.940 align:middle line:90%
It's you alone with everything.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.243 align:middle line:84%
So, fear that is natural kind
of thing that you possess

00:35:11.243 --> 00:35:15.414 align:middle line:84%
from the animal kingdom that in
faction we have fear it will

00:35:15.414 --> 00:35:16.748 align:middle line:90%
drop off as well.

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Fear? What fear?

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.487 align:middle line:84%
So discovering the oneness
is the only way you overcome

00:35:21.487 --> 00:35:22.621 align:middle line:90%
fear forever.

00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:25.457 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, it's not
just a negative thing

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:26.792 align:middle line:90%
that you work on fear.

00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:30.796 align:middle line:84%
It's a very positive, very
exciting experiential dimension

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:33.632 align:middle line:84%
because you can say, oh,
close my eyes and meditate.

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:35.734 align:middle line:84%
That's a very limited
way of meditating.

00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:37.736 align:middle line:90%
Meditate with open eyes.

00:35:37.736 --> 00:35:40.506 align:middle line:84%
With open eyes look around
and see your link with all

00:35:40.506 --> 00:35:43.408 align:middle line:84%
of creations especially with
human beings who light up.

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:47.546 align:middle line:84%
This is becoming one of
meditating with open eyes.

00:35:47.546 --> 00:35:51.083 align:middle line:84%
Why not? This is what my mentor
Vivekananda used to do.

00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:53.585 align:middle line:84%
You see when he talks,
he talks with the spirit.

00:35:53.585 --> 00:35:56.822 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that comes near him
is, of course, charged up.

00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Also with Raman Maharshi.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:59.525 align:middle line:84%
When Brunton used to visit Raman
Maharshi,

00:35:59.525 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
he would say sometimes Raman
Maharshi wouldn't speak at all.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.196 align:middle line:84%
He'll just look at
you and his glance

00:36:04.196 --> 00:36:06.865 align:middle line:84%
at you would really lift you
off that I'm no longer the body,

00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I am the spirit of--
Oh, chaps,

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.735 align:middle line:90%
I feel I'm floating.

00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:13.338 align:middle line:84%
These are the real experience
of real genuine prophets

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:84%
who are not only
talking about oneness

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.842 align:middle line:90%
who are experiencing oneness.

00:36:16.842 --> 00:36:19.878 align:middle line:84%
If you come in front of them,
you experience the same oneness.

00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:23.181 align:middle line:84%
It lifts you off, your very
limited vision regarding

00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:90%
who you think you are,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.186 align:middle line:84%
suddenly from the very limited
vision, that dream is broken

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.522 align:middle line:84%
and you see oneness
with greater creation.

00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:34.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, does that
shadow or that darker side

00:36:34.293 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
or that fear is just,
because we hear, you know,

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.765 align:middle line:90%
the more lighter you feel,

00:36:39.765 --> 00:36:43.001 align:middle line:84%
the more enlightened you feel
the more dark also comes is

00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:44.736 align:middle line:90%
that true or is it just?

00:36:44.736 --> 00:36:46.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: You see,
the thing is this again

00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:48.774 align:middle line:84%
in the Hindi tradition we
don't tell evil as such.

00:36:48.774 --> 00:36:50.742 align:middle line:84%
There's no evil, you
know, throwing his light on us.

00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:56.348 align:middle line:84%
We simply say in the
process of manifesting

00:36:56.348 --> 00:36:58.317 align:middle line:84%
in this particular
manner we have to go

00:36:58.317 --> 00:37:00.552 align:middle line:84%
through many different
life forms and you're going

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:01.887 align:middle line:90%
through the animal life form.

00:37:01.887 --> 00:37:04.823 align:middle line:84%
Hindus agree with Darwin. We
come out of animal kingdom.

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you are going through this
particular journey of passing

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.597 align:middle line:84%
through many animal
lifetimes in the animal life,

00:37:11.597 --> 00:37:13.966 align:middle line:90%
life is very cruel, very cruel.

00:37:13.966 --> 00:37:15.734 align:middle line:90%
It's eat or be eaten.

00:37:15.734 --> 00:37:19.371 align:middle line:84%
It's very nasty as they
say the life is, you know,

00:37:19.371 --> 00:37:20.572 align:middle line:90%
nature is red in tooth and claw.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:23.609 align:middle line:90%
It's violent and vicious.

00:37:23.609 --> 00:37:26.578 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these things
we acquired have come

00:37:26.578 --> 00:37:27.913 align:middle line:90%
from the animal kingdom.

00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:29.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Survival
of the fittest.

00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:30.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: Survival
of the fittest.

00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:84%
So all these ideas or
even fighting for yourself

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:37.322 align:middle line:84%
or competitive spirit or
crushing the weak was acquired

00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:38.557 align:middle line:90%
in the animal kingdom.

00:37:38.557 --> 00:37:40.492 align:middle line:84%
That was the name of the
game in the animal kingdom.

00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:43.262 align:middle line:84%
So, survival of the fittest
was the name of the game

00:37:43.262 --> 00:37:45.530 align:middle line:84%
in the animal kingdom, but when
you enter the human kingdom we

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.799 align:middle line:84%
still inherit some
of these features.

00:37:47.799 --> 00:37:50.369 align:middle line:84%
That's why some human beings so
vicious, so violent, so nasty.

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:52.504 align:middle line:84%
Not because they're an evil
person.

00:37:52.504 --> 00:37:55.974 align:middle line:84%
They're in a way expressing what
they already-- the baggage they

00:37:55.974 --> 00:37:57.809 align:middle line:90%
carry from the animal kingdom.

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:00.445 align:middle line:84%
It's only when they're in the
human kingdom you slowly begin

00:38:00.445 --> 00:38:03.315 align:middle line:84%
to become rounded and you now
no longer see yourself fighting

00:38:03.315 --> 00:38:04.483 align:middle line:90%
for survival.

00:38:04.483 --> 00:38:06.351 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself in
other human beings, so rather

00:38:06.351 --> 00:38:08.820 align:middle line:84%
than killing others you
want to cooperate rather

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.155 align:middle line:90%
than compete with others.

00:38:10.155 --> 00:38:13.725 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of not competing
but cooperating with others

00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:16.461 align:middle line:84%
because natural because the
human kingdom you can do that.

00:38:16.461 --> 00:38:18.463 align:middle line:84%
The animal kingdom
you are just stuck.

00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:19.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's time to evolve?

00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:21.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Lakhani: Time to evolve.

00:38:21.266 --> 00:38:22.234 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:22.234 --> 00:38:24.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you
so much, Jay,

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:25.704 align:middle line:90%
for this delicious conversation.

00:38:25.704 --> 00:38:26.972 align:middle line:90%
I really enjoyed it.

00:38:26.972 --> 00:38:30.108 align:middle line:84%
Is there a last thing that
you want to leave us with

00:38:30.108 --> 00:38:32.744 align:middle line:84%
or something else that
is on your mind or heart?

00:38:32.744 --> 00:38:34.746 align:middle line:84%
>> Lakhani: The universe,
humanity's evolving

00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:36.415 align:middle line:84%
at its own pace in
a wonderful manner.

00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:37.616 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need any
help from me.

00:38:37.616 --> 00:38:38.283 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter]

00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:39.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Thank you.

00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:40.452 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:41.687 align:middle line:90%
It was really pleasurable.

00:38:41.687 --> 00:38:42.788 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:45.657 align:middle line:84%
Thank you! Much, much love
from beautiful London.

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:47.993 align:middle line:90%
Big kisses to all of you.

00:38:47.993 --> 00:38:49.327 align:middle line:90%
Byebye.
