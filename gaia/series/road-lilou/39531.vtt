00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.381 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here on the road.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.783 align:middle line:90%
I'm in England.

00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:18.819 align:middle line:84%
Again in England because there
is fabulous, fabulous teachers,

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.989 align:middle line:84%
speakers, mystics
here in England too.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.257 align:middle line:90%
Not just in the US.

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:24.692 align:middle line:90%
Not only in Australia.

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:26.794 align:middle line:84%
But in England there
is fabulous,

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:28.095 align:middle line:90%
amazing people like you.

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.264 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak
of time bending.

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%
I know you like this topic.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.968 align:middle line:90%
Time. Time.

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.804 align:middle line:84%
We're stressed by time in
our society, aren't we Tom?

00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:39.573 align:middle line:84%
>> Tom Evans: Yeah there's just
not enough hours in the day.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: There's not!

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.109 align:middle line:84%
But we can do something
about that.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.379 align:middle line:84%
You wrote many books --
probably 9 books I think --

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.214 align:middle line:90%
including "The Zone".

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:49.316 align:middle line:84%
Including -- what are
some of the latest ones?

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.018 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well "The
Zone" is the latest one.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I've just wrote one this
year called, "This we are".

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.556 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about them is that none

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.057 align:middle line:90%
of my books take long to write.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.626 align:middle line:90%
Because when you're in the zone,

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.828 align:middle line:84%
time takes on this
ethereal quality.

00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:01.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:01:01.896 --> 00:01:03.164 align:middle line:84%
It's like it comes
to us, and this is --

00:01:03.164 --> 00:01:06.834 align:middle line:84%
we're going to make this
video very practical and very,

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.636 align:middle line:90%
very interesting, huh?

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:12.373 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the concept of
time and how we can change that.

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:14.842 align:middle line:84%
Really not master
it, but make the most

00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:90%
of our time here on earth?

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Fair enough.

00:01:17.945 --> 00:01:18.746 align:middle line:84%
Well listen, the main
thing is about time is

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.147 align:middle line:90%
that it's an illusion.

00:01:20.147 --> 00:01:21.549 align:middle line:84%
And it's an illusion
that allows us

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
to have this experience
on earth.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.617 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of useful.

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.186 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want
to get rid of time,

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:26.987 align:middle line:84%
we just want to manage
it better.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:31.091 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing to note
about time is that it's affected

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.593 align:middle line:90%
by the speed of our breath.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:33.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:34.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So if you want
to create some more time,

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.164 align:middle line:90%
just breath a bit slower.

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.667 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
giant tortoise

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:42.635 align:middle line:84%
that breathes 4 times every
minute lives to 140 years.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.973 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that also
breathing slow will extend

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:46.907 align:middle line:90%
your longevity.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.108 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind
of thing to do.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
do some belly breaths.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.346 align:middle line:84%
So you put your hands on your
belly like that, and you breath

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.248 align:middle line:84%
in so your middle
fingers just part.

00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:55.649 align:middle line:90%
And then you breathe out fully

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.585 align:middle line:84%
so then your middle
finger touches again.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.854 align:middle line:84%
And if you do about 4 or 5
belly breaths before you do any

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:05.526 align:middle line:84%
creative task, that really helps
slow down the speed of time.

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:07.094 align:middle line:84%
So you get more done
in less time.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:09.396 align:middle line:84%
It makes you less
stressed as well.

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:10.397 align:middle line:90%
Which is kind of good.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:11.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So of course meditation --
you speak of meditation.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.204 align:middle line:84%
And how it's important to do
that at least 10 minutes a day?

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.206 align:middle line:84%
And well I'm going
to take people

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.841 align:middle line:84%
through now a very
simple way to meditate.

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:22.576 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people say they
can't make their mind go quiet.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:25.346 align:middle line:84%
But before we do that, we're
going to have a little play.

00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:27.815 align:middle line:84%
So I might need to -- how
am I going to do this?

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.617 align:middle line:84%
I might -- I have to
hold the microphone.

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:30.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Okay.

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And what I'm going
to get you to do, is I'm going

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:35.389 align:middle line:84%
to get you to energize
both sides of the brain.

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.423 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So we just have

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.958 align:middle line:84%
to make sure this
is a unidirectional.

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:38.659 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:39.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: That's right.

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:40.261 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:40.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: -- make
sure it's towards you.

00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:41.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Okay.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Right. So what we're
going to do is this.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.833 align:middle line:84%
Is that the neurons in our
brain don't store any oxygen.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.601 align:middle line:84%
And what happens throughout
the day is we breathe

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.136 align:middle line:84%
through different nostrils
without knowing it.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
through your left nostril,

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:53.307 align:middle line:90%
it energizes the right brain.

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:55.509 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
through your right nostril,

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.877 align:middle line:90%
it energizes the left brain.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:00.447 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you literally
hold your index finger here.

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:03.751 align:middle line:84%
Hold your index finger
on this nostril.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.954 align:middle line:84%
And breathe in and
out about 4 or 5 times

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:08.656 align:middle line:90%
through your right nostril.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.924 align:middle line:84%
And after you've done
that you flip over,

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:11.859 align:middle line:84%
and you do it the
other way around.

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.927 align:middle line:84%
And then through
the other nostril.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:20.834 align:middle line:90%
[ Pause ]

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.036 align:middle line:90%
And this is a great thing

00:03:22.036 --> 00:03:23.937 align:middle line:84%
to do before you do
any creative activity.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.606 align:middle line:90%
It just gives you an extra zap.

00:03:25.606 --> 00:03:27.107 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the thing
about the brain --

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:27.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: An extra zap!

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:28.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.976 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.311 align:middle line:90%
Just --

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.246 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I love those British
expressions that they got!

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:90%
A zap!

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: [Chuckles] and it -

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:35.482 align:middle line:84%
especially after lunch you
might have some carbohydrates

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:36.684 align:middle line:84%
or a sandwich and we
get a bit sluggish.

00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:39.353 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
good way of doing it.

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:40.621 align:middle line:84%
And you can -- when
you go out for a walk

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.723 align:middle line:84%
and you move your hands
across your body like that.

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.058 align:middle line:90%
That does the same thing.

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.694 align:middle line:84%
It moves the cerebral spinal
fluid around in your brain,

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.129 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you that
ability for the left brain

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.597 align:middle line:90%
to talk to the right brain.

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:52.232 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And here's the
thing about the brain is

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:84%
that the left brain and the
right brain have different

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.336 align:middle line:90%
experiences of time.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.172 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that the
left brain is logical

00:03:58.172 --> 00:03:59.506 align:middle line:90%
and the right brain is creative,

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:02.976 align:middle line:84%
but the left brain sits
inside space and time

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:06.313 align:middle line:84%
and sees the detail and is
great at doing remembered tasks.

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:09.116 align:middle line:84%
And the right brain sits
everywhere and every

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.785 align:middle line:90%
when else and sees the whole.

00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And when
you get the left

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.089 align:middle line:84%
and right brain working
together on the same task --

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.923 align:middle line:84%
which this nostril
breathing helps you do --

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:20.127 align:middle line:84%
then it really gets you into
this slightly different time.

00:04:20.127 --> 00:04:20.694 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:21.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: But then we've got
to pull another trick off.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.432 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're going
to make our mind go quiet.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.801 align:middle line:84%
And the trick is to do
this with our eyes open.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.636 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't -- if
you're going to meditate,

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:30.904 align:middle line:84%
you can't write when
you meditate.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.041 align:middle line:84%
Or you can't maybe
compose or do some art.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:35.743 align:middle line:84%
You might be able to compose
some music, but you know,

00:04:35.743 --> 00:04:37.478 align:middle line:90%
you need to have your eyes open.

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:39.346 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn
this technique

00:04:39.346 --> 00:04:41.215 align:middle line:90%
of eyes open meditation.

00:04:41.215 --> 00:04:45.052 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of starts by
just being slightly defocused

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:47.388 align:middle line:84%
and our eyes going
into peripheral vision.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:49.289 align:middle line:84%
But just becoming
aware of our breath.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.658 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
aware of your breath --

00:04:51.658 --> 00:04:54.361 align:middle line:84%
when you're thinking about your
breath as opposed to thinking

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
about your thoughts, then
your thoughts go quiet.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:04:58.065 --> 00:04:59.466 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So we think
about the in breath --

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:03.537 align:middle line:84%
and we think about the in breath
as being the way that we inspire

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.974 align:middle line:84%
and we bring thoughts and
wisdom and knowledge in.

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:11.678 align:middle line:84%
And on the expiration, we bring
out our grace and gratitude

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.381 align:middle line:84%
for what we're just
about to received.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.582 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:16.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And if all you
do is just think about the

00:05:16.784 --> 00:05:19.286 align:middle line:84%
in breath -- there's the
incoming thoughts and the

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.155 align:middle line:84%
out breath -- the
outgoing thoughts.

00:05:21.155 --> 00:05:24.158 align:middle line:84%
What you're going to bring into
the world through this process.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.827 align:middle line:84%
What happens by doing that
as you repeat that process?

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:29.663 align:middle line:84%
What happens by doing that
is your thoughts about,

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.532 align:middle line:84%
oh I'm not going to
get my book published;

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.733 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got time to do this.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:35.169 align:middle line:84%
All of those other fearful
thoughts go quiescent

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and get replaced
by these lovely,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.105 align:middle line:90%
beautiful thoughts instead.

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.874 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So this again warms
you up for this whole process.

00:05:40.874 --> 00:05:42.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:43.177 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: But now what we
have to do is then move

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.813 align:middle line:84%
into this position
of channeling.

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:48.315 align:middle line:84%
Where we allow the external
thoughts to come in.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.118 align:middle line:84%
And it's an illusion
again that our brain,

00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:53.754 align:middle line:84%
is it just a generator
of thoughts?

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:58.291 align:middle line:84%
So it's as much a generator as
it is a receiver of thoughts.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:00.694 align:middle line:84%
And we can receive
thoughts from what's known

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:01.895 align:middle line:90%
as the collective consciousness.

00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:03.664 align:middle line:84%
Some people might
call it the angels

00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.866 align:middle line:90%
or the archangels or source.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.569 align:middle line:84%
You know? I'm fairly agnostic
about what that's all about.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.771 align:middle line:84%
Don't know the answer. Don't
know if it is beings.

00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:14.308 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't know if it is us
creating this collective --

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:15.542 align:middle line:90%
all I know is when you get

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.644 align:middle line:84%
into this mode you can
produce some beautiful work

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't otherwise
come out.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:21.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And the way you do
that is you put your tongue

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.016 align:middle line:90%
to the roof of your mouth.

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:25.953 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine a
point about an inch up

00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:28.755 align:middle line:84%
and two inches back
inside your brain.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.724 align:middle line:90%
And then this is the point --

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:31.859 align:middle line:84%
this is known as
the pineal gland,

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:34.194 align:middle line:84%
or the cave of the
original spirit.

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:36.296 align:middle line:90%
It's known as your third eye.

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:39.833 align:middle line:84%
And this is about there,
but back in your brain.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.468 align:middle line:84%
So it's the top of
the spinal column.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:44.571 align:middle line:84%
So you imagine, if these two
lines were to meet in the middle

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.873 align:middle line:84%
of my brain, that's
where it would be.

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And we just imagine that our
consciousness goes there.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:84%
And you imagine that
you're looking

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:52.846 align:middle line:90%
at the back of your eyeballs.

00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That is cool!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: I know.

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:55.849 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
back of your eyeballs,

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you're actually looking
at your own thoughts.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh my God!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:58.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: I know.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:06:59.319 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of cool isn't it?

00:06:59.319 --> 00:06:59.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Isn't that cool?

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:00.921 align:middle line:90%
You like it?

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: It gets
better than this!

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:02.756 align:middle line:90%
It gets better!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.758 align:middle line:84%
Then what you do is you
imagine that from that point --

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:05.826 align:middle line:90%
and it takes a while to do this.

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:06.994 align:middle line:84%
It takes a bit of
practice to do it.

00:07:06.994 --> 00:07:09.196 align:middle line:90%
From that point you look up.

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.998 align:middle line:84%
And you look up from the
inside of your brain.

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.799 align:middle line:84%
And you see a hole at
the top of your skull.

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I love it!

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: And this hole is

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.971 align:middle line:84%
where all the thoughts
are popping in through.

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And they just pop down.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you get there, and
you just think of a seed word.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.013 align:middle line:84%
So let's say your
new book, religion.

00:07:26.013 --> 00:07:28.081 align:middle line:84%
You think of the
seed word, religion.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:32.653 align:middle line:84%
And you let your hand be taken
over and the words just flow.

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:33.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Isn't that cool?

00:07:33.987 --> 00:07:36.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Mm-hmm.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.725 align:middle line:84%
And like all these things, it
takes a little bit of practice.

00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:41.495 align:middle line:84%
And there's a -- on my website
there's a free visualization

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that takes you through
this whole process

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.731 align:middle line:90%
in slightly more detail.

00:07:44.731 --> 00:07:47.367 align:middle line:84%
But that's kind of the
way you get into the zone.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.703 align:middle line:84%
And after a while of
course, all you do is snap.

00:07:49.703 --> 00:07:51.071 align:middle line:90%
Straight in the zone.

00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:53.507 align:middle line:84%
Bang. Whatever is coming through
is there -- it's just there.

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because the
inspiration comes really quickly

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.578 align:middle line:90%
after that doesn't it?

00:07:57.578 --> 00:07:58.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well I think you've
got to look at the word.

00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I love looking at etymology.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.916 align:middle line:84%
Right? So do you
know, for example,

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:07.254 align:middle line:84%
that most humans can't
speak on an in breath?

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:09.022 align:middle line:84%
So try and speak on
an in breath just now.

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:09.856 align:middle line:90%
[background conversations].

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:11.224 align:middle line:90%
Now there's always exceptions.

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I found out the Icelandic
can do it.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.228 align:middle line:84%
And also I did a talk once
where there was a flautist --

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.363 align:middle line:84%
someone that plays a
flute, and she said,

00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:17.831 align:middle line:84%
I can do it on the
in breath as well.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.565 align:middle line:90%
So there's always humans

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:21.401 align:middle line:84%
that can do something
other humans can't.

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:24.438 align:middle line:84%
But most people only
speak on an out breath.

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:27.908 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the etymology
of the word, "Inspiration",

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:30.611 align:middle line:84%
it comes from the Latin spirare
-- which means to breathe.

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.479 align:middle line:90%
And "In" which means in.

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:34.181 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
definition in the dictionary,

00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:37.383 align:middle line:84%
it also says, it's not just
a person that's inspiring,

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.585 align:middle line:90%
or an inspiring thing.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:44.858 align:middle line:84%
It's thoughts that come
from a spiritual direction.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:47.794 align:middle line:84%
So I had the enlightening moment
once that perhaps thoughts come

00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:51.999 align:middle line:84%
in on the in breath,
and then our actions --

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.868 align:middle line:84%
we aspire to them --
on the out breath.

00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.137 align:middle line:84%
But actually what happens
is, it's the still point

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.506 align:middle line:84%
between the two breaths
where the thoughts come in.

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:00.574 align:middle line:90%
So I mean if you just --

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:01.975 align:middle line:84%
if you pay attention
to the still point,

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:04.411 align:middle line:84%
that's when the enlightful
moments sneak into your brain.

00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:05.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.648 align:middle line:84%
But we can't think of it too
much, otherwise it stops.

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well yeah,
and if you think

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.449 align:middle line:90%
of it, it stops [chuckles].

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:10.884 align:middle line:90%
So then if you think,

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.853 align:middle line:84%
oh I haven't got enough
time to write this book.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:14.354 align:middle line:84%
It stops. If you
think, I'm never going

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.455 align:middle line:90%
to get this book published.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:17.324 align:middle line:84%
It stops. If you think
I'm not good enough.

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:18.692 align:middle line:90%
It stops. Yeah.

00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:21.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Are we touching here
what some call as alterism?

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.164 align:middle line:90%
Mysticism?

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:25.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Well you know what?

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.701 align:middle line:84%
I'm an engineer, so
I call it practice.

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I call it a practice
you can get into.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.641 align:middle line:84%
I don't ascribe any woo-woo
la-la type of attribute to it.

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.309 align:middle line:90%
It just is what it is.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.879 align:middle line:84%
And it's a state you can get
into where you produce stuff.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.515 align:middle line:90%
So is it mystic?

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.517 align:middle line:84%
Is it something otherworldly
going on?

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.386 align:middle line:84%
Well all I know is that I
produced 9 books in less

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:48.789 align:middle line:84%
than 4 years using
these techniques.

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.558 align:middle line:84%
So it's got practical
applications.

00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:52.359 align:middle line:90%
And I feel healthier.

00:09:52.359 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And I feel more vibrant --

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.561 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.896 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: -- and alive.

00:09:55.896 --> 00:09:58.965 align:middle line:84%
And I'm -- and also I'm writing
stuff that I didn't know.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:09:59.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So I didn't
plan to write --

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle line:84%
half my books I didn't
even plan to write them.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.171 align:middle line:90%
Then they just popped in.

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:07.874 align:middle line:84%
And then only afterwards did I
find out that things were true.

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.509 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example then.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.778 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a non -- a fiction book.

00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.847 align:middle line:84%
And I had a book
mentor at the time.

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:15.215 align:middle line:90%
She said, whatever you do,

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:18.118 align:middle line:84%
don't research while you're
writing; you'll never finish.

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.421 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted Mars and the
Earth to be on opposite sides

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.859 align:middle line:90%
of the sun, 116 years from now.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.427 align:middle line:90%
So -- and I -- because I've --

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:28.829 align:middle line:84%
I knew a little bit
about astronomy.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.063 align:middle line:84%
I knew that ever
two years they're

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:31.531 align:middle line:90%
on opposite sides of the sun.

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.935 align:middle line:84%
She said, just pull a date at
random, while you're writing,

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and then make a note
in the comments

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:37.904 align:middle line:90%
to go and check the date.

00:10:37.904 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled a date
at random out.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.043 align:middle line:84%
And then in the week I found
an online solar system.

00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.913 align:middle line:84%
And I wound the solar system
on 116 years, and on the date

00:10:46.913 --> 00:10:49.616 align:middle line:84%
that I chose at random, Mars
and the Earth were exactly

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.418 align:middle line:90%
where I wanted them to be.

00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:52.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So just
imagine [chuckles],

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.488 align:middle line:90%
this is the sort of stuff.

00:10:54.488 --> 00:10:56.123 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a -- the chance

00:10:56.123 --> 00:10:57.758 align:middle line:84%
of that happening
is infinitesimal.

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:58.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:01.328 align:middle line:84%
So when you write the
book, you're tuning in?

00:11:01.328 --> 00:11:04.131 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're letting it
flow through your hand?

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:07.534 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I guess, like
any writer you have your little

00:11:07.534 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:90%
blogs happening here and there?

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:11.872 align:middle line:90%
Or does it just flows for you?

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:15.409 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well it flows, but
-- and I'm a morning person.

00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:16.643 align:middle line:84%
So I always write
in the morning.

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:18.712 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm also a spring person.

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So most of my books
are written --

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.549 align:middle line:84%
I start them on the
Spring Equinox.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:24.785 align:middle line:84%
So I don't try and
write books at the times

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.219 align:middle line:90%
when I'm not efficient.

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:27.587 align:middle line:90%
If you know what I mean.

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:29.122 align:middle line:84%
So I don't try and write in
the evening when I'm not good.

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:31.625 align:middle line:84%
I don't try and write the
books in winter and autumn

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:33.293 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not researching
the books.

00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:35.562 align:middle line:84%
And so it's knowing when
your natural cycles are.

00:11:35.562 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I even write in tune
with the moon as well.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.466 align:middle line:84%
So the moon phase
affects our creativity.

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:40.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:42.736 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: You know,
we're 70%, 80% water.

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:45.806 align:middle line:84%
And the moon has a massive
effect over the tides.

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:48.241 align:middle line:84%
And it's no coincidence
that the lunatics come

00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:50.744 align:middle line:84%
out of the asylum
on the full moon.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:54.281 align:middle line:84%
We have more admissions into
hospitals at that time as well.

00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And the moon actually has
an affect on our creativity.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.286 align:middle line:84%
And when you tune into it,
there are certain times

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.154 align:middle line:90%
when it's good to plan.

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.923 align:middle line:84%
Good times when it's
good to dream.

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:06.226 align:middle line:84%
And good times when it's --
for when you want to write.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But from
what you're saying,

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.862 align:middle line:90%
this naturally happens anyway.

00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:09.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: It does.

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.264 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes what happens is,

00:12:11.264 --> 00:12:14.701 align:middle line:84%
if I find that I'm
not being creative,

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:16.736 align:middle line:84%
I just go to my moon
calendar and go,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.772 align:middle line:84%
you weren't supposed
to be creative!

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:19.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's okay.

00:12:19.606 --> 00:12:21.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Give yourself a break.

00:12:21.508 --> 00:12:23.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And when
doubts pop in your mind,

00:12:23.443 --> 00:12:25.045 align:middle line:90%
what do you do with those?

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:28.348 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well when doubts come
in, I say, what's the lesson?

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:29.883 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to learn?

00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:32.018 align:middle line:90%
And what is my internal guide

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:34.387 align:middle line:84%
or external guide telling
me that I need to be.

00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:36.756 align:middle line:84%
So doubt might be you're
writing the wrong thing

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.924 align:middle line:90%
at the wrong time.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.427 align:middle line:84%
You're writing it
in the first person;

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.862 align:middle line:84%
it should be written
in the third person.

00:12:41.862 --> 00:12:42.996 align:middle line:90%
That sort of stuff.

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:44.064 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:44.931 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But all
being interconnected,

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:84%
could we receive
some information

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.402 align:middle line:84%
that is not actually our
doubts, and not our own,

00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:50.804 align:middle line:84%
and that we could
totally dismiss?

00:12:50.804 --> 00:12:52.138 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Absolutely.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:55.242 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're really,
really connected, then we move

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:84%
into the mode where we
could become prescient.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:13:01.214 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most amazing
scientific discoveries are made

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:02.482 align:middle line:90%
in that mode.

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.452 align:middle line:84%
I mean this guy Kekule, he
-- a Belgian biochemist --

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:11.324 align:middle line:84%
he discovered how organic
chemistry worked in a dream.

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:14.327 align:middle line:84%
He dreamt of a snake
biting its own tail.

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:15.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:13:15.262 --> 00:13:16.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And he
got the benzine --

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:17.764 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
benzine molecule.

00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:20.867 align:middle line:84%
And from that, all our organic
chemistry came from this dream.

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.769 align:middle line:84%
So when we go into
that quiescent point,

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:24.371 align:middle line:84%
like when we're dreaming
or we're meditating

00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.273 align:middle line:84%
where the conscious
mind is quiescent,

00:13:26.273 --> 00:13:28.074 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of things can come in.

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:29.976 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine if you're -- you
know, you're not writing a book

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:84%
but you're in a company and you
want to create a new product,

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:35.015 align:middle line:84%
then get in these
enlightful moments.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:37.684 align:middle line:84%
They just pop in just like
that and they're just perfect.

00:13:37.684 --> 00:13:38.952 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:40.921 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to see mindfulness
coming into business.

00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:41.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:13:41.922 --> 00:13:43.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Not just
as a nice to have,

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:46.326 align:middle line:84%
and one day a year we'll
go on a mindfulness day.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.229 align:middle line:84%
In the afternoon, we
will have 20 minutes

00:13:49.229 --> 00:13:51.298 align:middle line:84%
of mindfulness before we
start our afternoon work.

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:52.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:13:52.232 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And it's
in the candor.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.068 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:13:55.068 --> 00:13:58.405 align:middle line:84%
You get -- work forces
will be more productive.

00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:90%
Work forces are happier.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.840 align:middle line:90%
More chilled out.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.942 align:middle line:90%
Less stress.

00:14:01.942 --> 00:14:05.045 align:middle line:84%
Less days off because
they're not as ill.

00:14:05.045 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can you
bring that to BBC?

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: I'd love to.

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:08.515 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in fact [background
chuckles] --

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:09.582 align:middle line:90%
well on my Zone Show --

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:11.518 align:middle line:84%
we finish the Zone
Show with a meditation.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.321 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's important
that we have this sort of --

00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:15.956 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to take
it into businesses.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.624 align:middle line:90%
It should be in schools as well.

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: We don't have -- the
teachers won't be as stressed.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.194 align:middle line:84%
The children won't
be as stressed.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:90%
The parents will be happier.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.366 align:middle line:84%
Our bills with the health
service will be less.

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:27.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:27.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: And it's free.

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:28.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:30.804 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the
healing portion.

00:14:30.804 --> 00:14:34.975 align:middle line:84%
How can we apply this to heal
a part of our body or something

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:39.512 align:middle line:84%
that we feel is disconnected
or not functioning optimally.

00:14:39.512 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Well it's an illusion.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.248 align:middle line:90%
We are an illusion.

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:45.151 align:middle line:84%
Our densified body is an
illusion in the same way

00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:47.721 align:middle line:84%
that the clock of
time is an illusion.

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.156 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do, with
a little bit of training,

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:51.858 align:middle line:90%
is you can see outside time.

00:14:51.858 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:90%
So as we look at each other now,

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:55.695 align:middle line:84%
we're sort of seeing each
other slightly fuzzy.

00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:57.797 align:middle line:84%
And I can see a slightly
past version of you,

00:14:57.797 --> 00:14:58.865 align:middle line:90%
and a future version of you.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.767 align:middle line:90%
And what that means is the time

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
between us is just
softening a little bit.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.474 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have a
diseased part of the body,

00:15:07.474 --> 00:15:10.877 align:middle line:84%
which might also be an
internal thought form as well,

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.345 align:middle line:90%
you can let that thought form

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:16.082 align:middle line:84%
or that disease slack it a
little bit, and be replaced

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:21.621 align:middle line:84%
by the bit of the body which is
healthy before the injury came

00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and after the healing
takes place.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you see the future part
of the body, which is healed.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.797 align:middle line:84%
You see the past part of the
body before it had the injury.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:33.867 align:middle line:84%
And you let them
solidify instead

00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.902 align:middle line:84%
of the diseased part
of the body.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:37.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:38.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: I call it
time bending therapy.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:40.373 align:middle line:90%
TBT it works a treat.

00:15:40.373 --> 00:15:41.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And where
does that go?

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
The other thoughts of
the disease itself?

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well, if you
think about the disease,

00:15:46.713 --> 00:15:49.082 align:middle line:90%
most disease starts in the mind.

00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:50.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:51.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So it starts
with a thought.

00:15:51.251 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a
diseased part of your body,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.422 align:middle line:90%
where did it come from?

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:58.023 align:middle line:84%
What was the thought
form that kicked it off?

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.392 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you've
got something wrong --

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:03.129 align:middle line:84%
if you've got a,
maybe a heart ailment,

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:05.932 align:middle line:84%
where's the lack of
love in your life?

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:08.401 align:middle line:84%
Where's the love
not coming from,

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:09.803 align:middle line:84%
and you not being
able to get it out?

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:12.338 align:middle line:84%
And that's what -- that's the
biggest source of heart disease.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: You know, if we've
got irritable bowel syndrome,

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:17.277 align:middle line:90%
where are the fears?

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:18.845 align:middle line:90%
What seeded the fears?

00:16:18.845 --> 00:16:20.213 align:middle line:90%
Where's the stress?

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:22.315 align:middle line:84%
You know? Ad of course what we
do is we give people tablets

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:23.817 align:middle line:84%
and pills and things like
that, but we never go

00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
down to the real source,
which is our mind -

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.254 align:middle line:90%
it starts in the mind.

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:30.957 align:middle line:84%
I just read in France,
there's 25%

00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:33.793 align:middle line:84%
of French people
have psychotropes.

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:34.894 align:middle line:90%
You know, the whole --

00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:37.197 align:middle line:84%
the antidepressant and
all that every year.

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Mm-hmm.

00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:39.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: 25% of the
population, my God!

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:40.834 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.335 align:middle line:84%
Well and also in the US
there's loads of people

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:90%
that take drugs for obesity.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.473 align:middle line:84%
And then they've got
to take pain killers

00:16:46.473 --> 00:16:47.807 align:middle line:90%
because their back hurts.

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:50.276 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to answer
the source of the issue is

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:51.945 align:middle line:84%
and what they're reasoning what
they're putting in their bodies

00:16:51.945 --> 00:16:53.713 align:middle line:84%
and the exercise
they're not taking.

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to give
ourselves a pill for something.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And then when the pill
doesn't work we give ourselves

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.218 align:middle line:90%
another pill.

00:16:58.218 --> 00:16:59.352 align:middle line:90%
And another pill.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And another pill.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.688 align:middle line:90%
And it's just crazy spending

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:84%
when the solution
is actually free.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.893 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of got
to start in schools.

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:08.794 align:middle line:84%
You know? It's got to start
in schools, and it's got

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.096 align:middle line:90%
to be brought into business.

00:17:10.096 --> 00:17:12.565 align:middle line:84%
So rather than, you know,
I'll meditate in the morning

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:14.134 align:middle line:90%
because I've got to go to work.

00:17:14.134 --> 00:17:16.602 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be great
is, at work I meditate.

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:17.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:22.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And imagine if you're
a forward-thinking employer

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:23.275 align:middle line:90%
in a business.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.544 align:middle line:84%
You could have a
workforce that's so happy.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.312 align:middle line:90%
So productive.

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.714 align:middle line:90%
So stress free.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.382 align:middle line:84%
Your competitors
won't get a look in.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.453 align:middle line:90%
The meditation part, we talked

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:36.623 align:middle line:84%
about it a little bit
earlier, but tell us again.

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:39.359 align:middle line:84%
You just stop those
thoughts and focus.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:41.494 align:middle line:84%
What type of meditation
do you recommend?

00:17:41.494 --> 00:17:42.929 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: There's two
types of meditation.

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.598 align:middle line:84%
All meditations fall
into two camps generally.

00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:47.167 align:middle line:90%
One's called Samatha.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.801 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
meditate on a thing.

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can meditate
on your breath.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.371 align:middle line:90%
You can meditate on a light.

00:17:51.371 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:90%
You can meditate on a mantra.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.142 align:middle line:84%
And when you meditate
on something,

00:17:56.142 --> 00:17:57.277 align:middle line:90%
or some of your thoughts go

00:17:57.277 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:84%
from what you're thinking
to something else.

00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:00.513 align:middle line:90%
So you're meditating on the in.

00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:01.614 align:middle line:90%
On the out.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:02.782 align:middle line:84%
On the in and out,
the in and the out.

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:05.785 align:middle line:84%
Or a mantra like
monaro har or that sort

00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:07.187 align:middle line:90%
of stuff or that sound.

00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
When you meditate on that thing,
then your thoughts go quiescent.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.626 align:middle line:84%
And then you -- from that
position of Samatha meditation,

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:16.196 align:middle line:84%
you can get into a deeper
meditation called upasana,

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:17.797 align:middle line:84%
when you meditate
on thought itself.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:19.165 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
take your consciousness

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:21.868 align:middle line:84%
to the inner eye, to
your pineal gland.

00:18:21.868 --> 00:18:23.903 align:middle line:84%
And from there you can
move your consciousness

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:24.971 align:middle line:90%
up and around your body.

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:26.239 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to move
your consciousness

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.409 align:middle line:84%
down to your heart center
or down to your gut mind;

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:31.177 align:middle line:84%
your iterant mind,
you can do that.

00:18:31.177 --> 00:18:33.913 align:middle line:84%
And then when you have
your consciousness

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:35.849 align:middle line:84%
in your iterant mind,
which is --

00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:38.384 align:middle line:84%
you know, our gut has more
neurons than a cats brain.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.652 align:middle line:90%
Would you believe?

00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:42.322 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
mode, you end up being 5

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.324 align:middle line:90%
or 10 seconds ahead of time.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:46.459 align:middle line:90%
So you can become precognitive.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.429 align:middle line:84%
You know when the phone's about
to ring, and you know who's

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:90%
on the other end of it?

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.265 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're getting a
signal from the iterant mind,

00:18:52.265 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
which is ahead of
your conscious brain.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:58.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So the meditative
stance, or the meditative state,

00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:01.708 align:middle line:84%
allows you to do tricks
with your consciousness.

00:19:01.708 --> 00:19:03.509 align:middle line:84%
Which aren't just
making the mind go quiet.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.677 align:middle line:90%
You can achieve other things.

00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:07.213 align:middle line:84%
We can get information
from the near future

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:08.748 align:middle line:90%
or from the far future.

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:11.584 align:middle line:84%
We can retrieve memories
that we've forgotten about.

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:14.254 align:middle line:84%
In a healing modality you can
take someone back to a trauma

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:15.555 align:middle line:84%
that they might have
forgotten about.

00:19:15.555 --> 00:19:18.625 align:middle line:84%
So let's say they had a deep
trauma they've overwritten

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:23.129 align:middle line:84%
in childhood, or even lots of
trauma happens in the womb.

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:26.599 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe in past lives
as well, then we can fix things

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that happen maybe in previous
lives as well by getting

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.638 align:middle line:90%
into that meditative state.

00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:36.309 align:middle line:84%
So it's a hugely beneficial
state to utilize and work with.

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:38.911 align:middle line:84%
You know? And I think
it's got applications,

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.581 align:middle line:84%
not just in healing but in
creativity and productivity.

00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:90%
In inventiveness, you know?

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:19:44.384 --> 00:19:46.853 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: There's no end
of places we can't use it.

00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:48.554 align:middle line:84%
But if we end up
in our monkey mind.

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.323 align:middle line:84%
If we're sitting
in that sort of --

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.959 align:middle line:90%
that internal commentary mind,

00:19:52.959 --> 00:19:55.061 align:middle line:84%
than none of this magic
comes into our world.

00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:55.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:19:55.895 --> 00:19:57.797 align:middle line:90%
And neither of the ego is there.

00:19:57.797 --> 00:19:58.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well the
ego is kind of --

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:00.166 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ego
is a good thing

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.768 align:middle line:84%
because it gives us our
sense of separateness.

00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:04.971 align:middle line:84%
It stops my body, you know,
merging with this chair.

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:06.572 align:middle line:84%
And merging with
everything else physically.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:09.475 align:middle line:84%
Yeah otherwise, so this sense
of ego's useful and it's kind

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:11.177 align:middle line:90%
of what we've signed up for.

00:20:11.177 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
To experience the
separate existence.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.882 align:middle line:84%
Because we spend a long
time in the collective.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:18.351 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're -- when
you're not in the mortal coil,

00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:20.586 align:middle line:84%
you're in the collective
and you're all with one.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.155 align:middle line:90%
And when we incarnate,

00:20:22.155 --> 00:20:24.357 align:middle line:84%
we decided to have
this separate existence

00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:25.491 align:middle line:84%
to see what it's
like and to learn.

00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.327 align:middle line:90%
So the ego's good for that.

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:30.964 align:middle line:84%
But we've used the word ego in
a slightly different context.

00:20:30.964 --> 00:20:32.198 align:middle line:90%
And we call it, you know,

00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:34.667 align:middle line:84%
this person's got the
ego the size of a planet.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:37.437 align:middle line:84%
So the modern day context
of ego is different

00:20:37.437 --> 00:20:38.705 align:middle line:90%
from the real sense of ego.

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:39.706 align:middle line:90%
So ego's good.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:40.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:41.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: But we use it
like, he's got a big ego.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:43.609 align:middle line:90%
Or she's got a big ego, or yeah.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.445 align:middle line:84%
And oh, it's got
a great acronym.

00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It stands for "Edging
God out" [chuckles].

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:49.482 align:middle line:90%
Yeah I love that.

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:51.484 align:middle line:84%
I think I've heard that first
from Wayne Dyre.

00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:51.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:53.353 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Actually there's a
really cool interview on Gaiam

00:20:55.488 --> 00:20:58.458 align:middle line:84%
that I did with Wayne
Dyre back in Maui.

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:02.228 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2011 on a juicy tour
that I -- and if you want,

00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:04.864 align:middle line:84%
as we're talking here, and
if you have some questions,

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:08.368 align:middle line:84%
don't hesitate to post
your comments underneath.

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:11.838 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, save
the video for later.

00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:13.206 align:middle line:90%
Or go to other things.

00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:15.742 align:middle line:84%
Because I love how Gaiam is
structured that allows you all

00:21:15.742 --> 00:21:17.543 align:middle line:90%
of that, and that rocks.

00:21:17.543 --> 00:21:19.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Cool.

00:21:19.545 --> 00:21:20.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: What else?

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.149 align:middle line:84%
I know you wrote on
the Zone and the --

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:25.051 align:middle line:90%
getting into the abundant zone.

00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:26.753 align:middle line:90%
Getting into this lucky zone.

00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:29.322 align:middle line:84%
Is that related to
the time conversation?

00:21:29.322 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Or not at all?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:32.825 align:middle line:84%
Well basically what
happened was that

00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:84%
"The Zone" was a book
I wrote this year.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.662 align:middle line:84%
I started it on the
Spring Equinox.

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:40.066 align:middle line:84%
And I finished it at
the Summer Solstice.

00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:42.201 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote it in two or
three months, you know?

00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the
zones we get into.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.339 align:middle line:84%
And I started to explore
this concept of zones.

00:21:46.339 --> 00:21:48.174 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're
"In the zone".

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:49.542 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
you can put --

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:52.478 align:middle line:84%
with the word "zone" you can
put in nearly any English word.

00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:54.046 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
have the aardvark zone

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:54.981 align:middle line:90%
or the banana zone.

00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Or the child zone.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.752 align:middle line:84%
And so I picked lots
of nice things

00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:00.686 align:middle line:90%
that go with the word zone.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.888 align:middle line:90%
Like the productive zone.

00:22:01.888 --> 00:22:03.289 align:middle line:90%
Or the entrepreneurial zone.

00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:04.724 align:middle line:90%
The creative zone.

00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:05.925 align:middle line:90%
The performance zone.

00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that also
we end up in danger zones.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.531 align:middle line:84%
You know, so when
we're in a doing zone,

00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:13.666 align:middle line:84%
and the wheels come off,
we end up in a danger zone.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And these danger zones might
be guilt or fear or anger.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I came up with the
concept of the healing zone.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.341 align:middle line:84%
So we can transit
from a danger zone,

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.944 align:middle line:84%
through the healing
zone, into a being zone.

00:22:24.944 --> 00:22:26.746 align:middle line:84%
But what I did when
I was driving --

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:27.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Because
they're all happening

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:29.115 align:middle line:90%
at the same time, aren't they?

00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:30.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Yeah we can be in
multiple zones at the same time.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:36.055 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're doing a new
business online and you want

00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:39.425 align:middle line:84%
to do a business -- a dating
agency -- online dating.

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:40.927 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be in
the creative zone.

00:22:40.927 --> 00:22:41.761 align:middle line:90%
In the loving zone.

00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:42.762 align:middle line:90%
And in the entrepreneurial zone

00:22:42.762 --> 00:22:44.197 align:middle line:84%
because you're starting
a new business.

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:46.999 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is people could
end up in multiple danger zones.

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:48.768 align:middle line:90%
So you might have an addiction.

00:22:48.768 --> 00:22:51.204 align:middle line:84%
And then you might end
up in the addiction zone.

00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:52.572 align:middle line:90%
The anger zone.

00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you're angry at the
system for having the addiction.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.677 align:middle line:84%
And then you're also in the
guilt zone because you're guilty

00:22:57.677 --> 00:22:59.111 align:middle line:90%
because you've got an addiction.

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.813 align:middle line:84%
So what I've found is,
you can actually --

00:23:00.813 --> 00:23:03.116 align:middle line:84%
I designed these zones -- when
I say I designed these zones,

00:23:03.116 --> 00:23:06.185 align:middle line:84%
I was driving along one day
and not thinking of anything.

00:23:06.185 --> 00:23:08.054 align:middle line:84%
And this idea came
in of a hexagon.

00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
That every zone's got 6
sides and 6 aspects to it.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.726 align:middle line:90%
Now a hexagon is brilliant

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:16.496 align:middle line:84%
because it's great
packing density.

00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:17.864 align:middle line:90%
It's like inside beehives.

00:23:17.864 --> 00:23:21.167 align:middle line:84%
You can put lots of hexagons
together and it's very strong.

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:23.936 align:middle line:84%
And I realized then with
the hexagons you can create

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:25.571 align:middle line:90%
super zones.

00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say you've
got some addiction.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:32.778 align:middle line:84%
You can surround the addiction
with some being and doing zones

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:34.881 align:middle line:90%
and it annuls the addiction.

00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:37.283 align:middle line:90%
But also you can create focus.

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:39.285 align:middle line:84%
So if you want some
more money in your life,

00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:84%
you can put an energetic symbol
in the middle of the zone,

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and surround that
with other stuff.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.492 align:middle line:84%
And I've got some
magical symbols

00:23:46.492 --> 00:23:48.895 align:middle line:84%
from an esoteric school
I belong to in Germany.

00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:51.531 align:middle line:84%
And I used that as the
generator of abundance.

00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:53.432 align:middle line:90%
Surround it with other zones

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:56.736 align:middle line:84%
that compliment abundance,
like magic.

00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Like creativity.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.772 align:middle line:84%
Like entrepreneurship,
and this sort of stuff.

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.874 align:middle line:90%
And you put this on your wall.

00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough that magic
leaks into your world.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.078 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell
you this story.

00:24:06.078 --> 00:24:08.814 align:middle line:84%
As I came up with this
idea for hexacombs.

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:13.085 align:middle line:84%
I was driving home, and I
just turned into my drive.

00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:14.787 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that,
a car came past

00:24:14.787 --> 00:24:18.124 align:middle line:90%
with H-E-X on the number plate.

00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:18.891 align:middle line:90%
Spooky.

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:19.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:21.661 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Is there a
danger to play too much

00:24:21.661 --> 00:24:24.363 align:middle line:84%
with all those --
the life itself?

00:24:24.363 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:84%
You know, that it
kind of backfires?

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:27.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Yeah I think
if you hold fear.

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:30.536 align:middle line:84%
Say if you have fear that
things are going to go wrong,

00:24:30.536 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:90%
then they will go wrong.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.538 align:middle line:84%
And if you have --
if you do this

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:33.606 align:middle line:90%
for your own aggrandizement.

00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:35.241 align:middle line:90%
So if the ego comes in.

00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:39.445 align:middle line:84%
And if you use magic for
your own personal gain,

00:24:39.445 --> 00:24:41.247 align:middle line:84%
then it has a tendency
of bouncing back at you.

00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:42.181 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:43.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: If you
know what I mean.

00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:45.351 align:middle line:84%
So my aim is that -- to
allow magic back in the world

00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:49.021 align:middle line:84%
in a very safe way, if
you know what I mean.

00:24:49.021 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And whatever magic you
bring into the world --

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:84%
if there's any black magic --
white magic is so much stronger.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.262 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of intrinsically
safe.

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:57.463 align:middle line:90%
If you know what I mean.

00:24:57.463 --> 00:24:59.065 align:middle line:84%
But your -- if you're
harboring a fear, it's --

00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:02.368 align:middle line:84%
it can be a little bit dangerous
to go down that kind of road.

00:25:02.368 --> 00:25:05.905 align:middle line:84%
But if you're harboring ego,
and if you want to use magic

00:25:05.905 --> 00:25:09.875 align:middle line:84%
to better your own position,
then it has a tendency

00:25:09.875 --> 00:25:11.744 align:middle line:90%
of just bouncing back at you.

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:12.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:13.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: And I love that phrase

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:18.217 align:middle line:84%
that magic is not --
it's entrusted to us.

00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:19.552 align:middle line:90%
And it comes through us.

00:25:19.552 --> 00:25:21.354 align:middle line:90%
We don't own it.

00:25:21.354 --> 00:25:23.823 align:middle line:84%
And I've got this
sneaking suspicion

00:25:23.823 --> 00:25:25.558 align:middle line:84%
that you're only
given enough magic

00:25:25.558 --> 00:25:26.792 align:middle line:90%
that you can be trusted with.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:28.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:29.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And if someone
does give you a bit of magic

00:25:29.128 --> 00:25:30.229 align:middle line:90%
that you're not ready for yet,

00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:31.764 align:middle line:84%
then it just bounces
back a little bit just

00:25:31.764 --> 00:25:32.932 align:middle line:90%
to tell you, just not yet.

00:25:32.932 --> 00:25:33.566 align:middle line:90%
If you know what I mean.

00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:34.333 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:35.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Life is perfect.

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:37.169 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Life is
intrinsically safe and perfect.

00:25:37.169 --> 00:25:38.304 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [chuckles].

00:25:38.304 --> 00:25:39.772 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Chuckles] you
look like a little bit

00:25:39.772 --> 00:25:41.307 align:middle line:90%
like a wizard don't you?

00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:42.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well people
call me that.

00:25:42.508 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
I've got one client that
calls me Dumbledore,

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.511 align:middle line:90%
which is [chuckles] funny.

00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:47.079 align:middle line:84%
But just for my sense
of balance,

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:49.148 align:middle line:84%
my partner calls me
Dobby the House Elf,

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:84%
just to ground me
at the weekend.

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:51.484 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:25:51.484 --> 00:25:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That's wonderful.

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:56.889 align:middle line:84%
What are some other concepts
that you go into or things

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:58.591 align:middle line:84%
that we should know,
for example,

00:25:58.591 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really
know in our society.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.562 align:middle line:90%
In our humanness?

00:26:03.562 --> 00:26:05.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well I think
there's a big concept

00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:07.466 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of interesting.

00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:09.735 align:middle line:90%
It's that we have an illusion

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:13.606 align:middle line:84%
that Tom is Tom and
Lilou is Lilou.

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:15.374 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
when we incarnate --

00:26:15.374 --> 00:26:19.412 align:middle line:84%
and I found this out by when
I started looking in the --

00:26:19.412 --> 00:26:21.347 align:middle line:90%
more working with the aura.

00:26:21.347 --> 00:26:25.885 align:middle line:84%
Is that we're an assemblage of
entities -- of spirit entities.

00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:27.687 align:middle line:84%
So one goes to the
head and says, I'll --

00:26:27.687 --> 00:26:30.256 align:middle line:84%
for this incarnation
I'll do the head stuff.

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:32.525 align:middle line:84%
Another one goes to the heart
and works in the heart center.

00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Another goes down
to the gut center.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.396 align:middle line:84%
They sit around our main chakra
points if you know what I mean.

00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our guidance
that maybe is not incarnate

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.671 align:middle line:84%
that sits either our cerebellum
or just above our head here.

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:50.509 align:middle line:84%
So we're an assemblage of spirit
entities all experiencing the

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:51.644 align:middle line:90%
human condition together.

00:26:51.644 --> 00:26:53.245 align:middle line:90%
And one of them might be --

00:26:53.245 --> 00:26:56.782 align:middle line:84%
in our gut guiding us, the other
might be in our heart, loving.

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:57.717 align:middle line:90%
And this sort of stuff.

00:26:57.717 --> 00:26:59.618 align:middle line:84%
And when we're not
feeling great,

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:02.855 align:middle line:84%
what you can do is do what I
call a soul part integration.

00:27:02.855 --> 00:27:05.691 align:middle line:84%
And we can take a part
that is not functioning.

00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:07.793 align:middle line:84%
And we can change --
either change it's function;

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.228 align:middle line:90%
give it a new job to do.

00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:10.963 align:middle line:90%
Or we can move its position

00:27:10.963 --> 00:27:14.667 align:middle line:84%
and we can install other
soul parts as well.

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:15.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:27:15.868 --> 00:27:17.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: So let's say
you want to write a book.

00:27:17.069 --> 00:27:20.039 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't feel that
you could write the book.

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.907 align:middle line:84%
We could actually say, well
let's bring an intelligence

00:27:21.907 --> 00:27:25.678 align:middle line:84%
in that knows how to write a
book and we can install it.

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:26.712 align:middle line:90%
And this is great work.

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:27.847 align:middle line:90%
It's great fun.

00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:28.647 align:middle line:84%
It's like Lego bricks
for the soul [chuckles]

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.549 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean?

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:31.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:34.353 align:middle line:84%
So why -- how about if you
don't know who to call?

00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:37.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well I do this work
and some of the people I work

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:39.658 align:middle line:84%
with are practitioners
of it as well.

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.026 align:middle line:90%
And we all work over Skype,

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:42.194 align:middle line:84%
so we can do it anywhere
in the world --

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:43.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah?

00:27:43.129 --> 00:27:43.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: -- which
is kind of good.

00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Can you just call
good light beings, wonderful,

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:49.835 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, loving
entities to help?

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:52.138 align:middle line:84%
And kind of they
figure out who's who.

00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.139 align:middle line:90%
And what's for what?

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:54.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: You can, yes.

00:27:54.507 --> 00:27:55.641 align:middle line:84%
So just decide what you want
to do and what you want to be.

00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:56.475 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:27:56.475 --> 00:27:57.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: You have to be clear?

00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:57.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:27:57.777 --> 00:27:58.844 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.846 align:middle line:84%
Or you might say, I
just want guidance.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:02.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:03.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And bring it
in so it's not specific.

00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.384 align:middle line:84%
And then that guidance
will just pop straight in.

00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:06.752 align:middle line:90%
So whatever you need to do.

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:09.255 align:middle line:90%
Or you might see external signs.

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:11.824 align:middle line:84%
So you might say, look
I need some information

00:28:11.824 --> 00:28:12.825 align:middle line:90%
of the direction to go in.

00:28:12.825 --> 00:28:13.893 align:middle line:90%
And then you might see a sign.

00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:15.294 align:middle line:84%
You might see a number
on a number plate.

00:28:15.294 --> 00:28:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You might see something in a
newspaper and that sort of --

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.899 align:middle line:84%
so for instance, I wanted one
of my books to be published.

00:28:19.899 --> 00:28:24.203 align:middle line:84%
And I had my -- I put my
submission into two publishers

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.539 align:middle line:84%
and they both sat
on it for 3 months.

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:28.274 align:middle line:90%
And I said, let's just see.

00:28:28.274 --> 00:28:30.643 align:middle line:84%
I need a response on this and I
want to get this book out there.

00:28:30.643 --> 00:28:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Asked for a sign, and within
one week I met 3 authors

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.082 align:middle line:84%
that had all published
with this other publisher.

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:38.284 align:middle line:90%
And so I submitted the book.

00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:40.452 align:middle line:84%
Within 48 hours I had
a publishing contract.

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:44.123 align:middle line:84%
And without going back to the
original two publishers, some --

00:28:44.123 --> 00:28:45.958 align:middle line:84%
they picked something up and
they both wrote to me saying

00:28:45.958 --> 00:28:47.693 align:middle line:90%
that we're not interested now.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:50.529 align:middle line:84%
So just ask for guidance
and it will be given.

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I heard you say super
consciousness.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.168 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:28:56.168 --> 00:28:57.369 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well you
know we've got the idea

00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:58.671 align:middle line:90%
about consciousness.

00:28:58.671 --> 00:28:59.705 align:middle line:90%
This self awareness.

00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:02.808 align:middle line:84%
We've got the idea
of unconsciousness.

00:29:02.808 --> 00:29:03.943 align:middle line:84%
Which is all the
things we don't know.

00:29:03.943 --> 00:29:05.711 align:middle line:84%
So you're not aware of
your big toe right now,

00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:06.712 align:middle line:90%
until I mention it.

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:07.613 align:middle line:84%
And then you're aware
of your big toe

00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:08.981 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:12.117 align:middle line:84%
You know. You're at a party and
then someone says your name,

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:13.485 align:middle line:90%
Tom or Lilou, then all

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:16.755 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden your unconscious
mind tells your conscious mind

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:19.391 align:middle line:84%
to direct itself
in that direction.

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:84%
The super-consciousness
is kind of a big concept.

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:24.964 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people have
popularized it.

00:29:24.964 --> 00:29:28.334 align:middle line:84%
The mystics and sages of the
ages might call it Brahman

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:29.735 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:32.705 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Young called it I think
the "Collective Unconscious".

00:29:32.705 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
super-consciousness

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.942 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
a higher state, again.

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:42.581 align:middle line:84%
And it's all of our thoughts and
memories from the past, present,

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:44.116 align:middle line:90%
and future all collected there.

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:46.318 align:middle line:84%
So other people call it the
neurosphere

00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:50.389 align:middle line:84%
that there's a theory that the
planet Earth is like a framework

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:52.458 align:middle line:90%
which stores all this energy.

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:54.827 align:middle line:84%
Other people call
it the I-field --

00:29:54.827 --> 00:29:56.562 align:middle line:84%
Irving Laslow calls it the
I-field --

00:29:56.562 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:90%
the information field.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.232 align:middle line:84%
Some people refer it to
the Zero Point Field.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:03.202 align:middle line:84%
So what I like at the moment
is like the quantum physicists

00:30:03.202 --> 00:30:04.436 align:middle line:90%
and the mystics are kind

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:06.305 align:middle line:84%
of converging
somewhat, you know?

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:08.073 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum physicists
are saying,

00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:09.408 align:middle line:84%
well we must have
more dimension.

00:30:09.408 --> 00:30:11.143 align:middle line:84%
There must be more dimensions
than our three dimensions

00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:12.678 align:middle line:90%
for the math to line up.

00:30:12.678 --> 00:30:15.481 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is that that's
where the information is stored,

00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:16.849 align:middle line:90%
and that our brains --

00:30:16.849 --> 00:30:20.352 align:middle line:84%
and in fact our whole neurology
are quantum transducers

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that can tap into and out of
this zero point quantum field.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.691 align:middle line:90%
Information field.

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:27.526 align:middle line:84%
Super-consciousness
and this sort of stuff.

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:29.862 align:middle line:84%
But if you're running your
internal thought process,

00:30:29.862 --> 00:30:31.497 align:middle line:90%
you block it.

00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:34.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hmm so it helps
to open the whole thing?

00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:35.634 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Open the crown, yeah.

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:36.568 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [background chuckles].

00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:37.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:38.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Work with
an open crown.

00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:40.005 align:middle line:90%
Work with open chakras.

00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:42.508 align:middle line:84%
Allow the magic to come
into your life and it does.

00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:44.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Bring on the magic!

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:46.178 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the other
little things that you would

00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:50.482 align:middle line:84%
like to share with us today as
we're closing this interview?

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:53.052 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well I'd
like to share the idea

00:30:53.052 --> 00:30:57.289 align:middle line:84%
that everybody can have
their dreams to come true.

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:59.625 align:middle line:84%
But what you've got to do
is make sure the dreams

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:90%
aren't self-centered.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:31:02.328 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And have what
I call a meta idea.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.599 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that's
beyond that; a meta-strategy.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:11.437 align:middle line:84%
So my meta-strategy is to
help awaken the planet.

00:31:11.437 --> 00:31:13.806 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
people keep introducing me

00:31:13.806 --> 00:31:17.042 align:middle line:84%
to other people that can help
the awakening of the planet.

00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.511 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, right now
there are 7 million people

00:31:19.511 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:90%
on planet Earth.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.117 align:middle line:84%
At any one time there's about 2
billion people that are asleep.

00:31:25.117 --> 00:31:27.753 align:middle line:84%
And out of those 2 billion
people that are asleep --

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:29.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Like asleep, asleep?

00:31:29.955 --> 00:31:32.024 align:middle line:90%
Or not awake, as conscious?

00:31:32.024 --> 00:31:36.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Because as the Earth
rotates, for 7/24 of the time,

00:31:36.395 --> 00:31:39.598 align:middle line:84%
then most people -- 2
billion people are asleep.

00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:41.467 align:middle line:84%
A billion of those
people are dreaming.

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:45.004 align:middle line:84%
And out of the 5 billion people
that are awake, most of them are

00:31:45.004 --> 00:31:46.739 align:middle line:90%
in some sort of waking dream.

00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.341 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And there's another
reality we can all awaken up to.

00:31:49.341 --> 00:31:53.512 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I'd
love to manifest and help.

00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:56.715 align:middle line:84%
Only because I find that
when you awaken to some

00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:59.618 align:middle line:84%
of these possibilities, you
can live a more magical life.

00:31:59.618 --> 00:32:00.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:01.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And wouldn't
it be great

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.788 align:middle line:84%
if everyone could
share that, it's free.

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:03.789 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:05.057 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And it's available
to all of us.

00:32:05.057 --> 00:32:07.626 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel this is
what we're stepping into.

00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.862 align:middle line:84%
And it's -- yeah
available to all of us,

00:32:09.862 --> 00:32:11.563 align:middle line:90%
regardless of our intellect.

00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:14.433 align:middle line:90%
Or regardless of our capacity.

00:32:14.433 --> 00:32:15.934 align:middle line:90%
Or of our past.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:17.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Yeah and you
don't want a big intellect

00:32:17.569 --> 00:32:18.937 align:middle line:90%
because that can get in the way.

00:32:18.937 --> 00:32:21.373 align:middle line:84%
You know? And that's where the
thoughts of ego can come up

00:32:21.373 --> 00:32:22.641 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of stuff.

00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:26.945 align:middle line:84%
So what you want is an
acceptance and a kind of love.

00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:30.516 align:middle line:84%
Moving our consciousness from
the brain to the heart center.

00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: You know, Rudolph
Steiner talks

00:32:33.085 --> 00:32:35.654 align:middle line:84%
about this, is the -- we --
over the billions of years,

00:32:35.654 --> 00:32:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we've woken up a
different chakra center.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.593 align:middle line:84%
And about 2 million years
ago or so, then our third --

00:32:41.593 --> 00:32:43.796 align:middle line:90%
our third eye woke up.

00:32:43.796 --> 00:32:46.031 align:middle line:90%
And now our crown is waking up.

00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:48.434 align:middle line:84%
And that the next
phase of humanity is

00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:51.136 align:middle line:84%
where the chakras
fall back down.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:55.507 align:middle line:84%
And when we got the word,
maybe you know, 100,000 years

00:32:55.507 --> 00:32:58.143 align:middle line:84%
or so ago, what happened is
we took conscious control

00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.711 align:middle line:90%
of our throat chakra.

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.113 align:middle line:84%
And you don't think
about this now do you?

00:33:01.113 --> 00:33:02.448 align:middle line:90%
That as you have a thought,

00:33:02.448 --> 00:33:03.916 align:middle line:84%
you're vibrating
your throat chakra

00:33:03.916 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're letting
those thoughts come

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.652 align:middle line:90%
out into the airwaves.

00:33:06.652 --> 00:33:08.454 align:middle line:84%
And then you go into
someone else's brain

00:33:08.454 --> 00:33:09.755 align:middle line:84%
and they have a similar
thought to you.

00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:12.558 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even give that
a second thought nowadays.

00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:14.493 align:middle line:84%
And one of the theories is
the next thing that's going

00:33:14.493 --> 00:33:18.664 align:middle line:84%
to happen is we take our heart
chakra under conscious control.

00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:22.167 align:middle line:84%
We take our gut and our
sacral and our root chakras

00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:23.769 align:middle line:90%
and link the conscious control,

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.804 align:middle line:84%
and then we can do all
sorts of other magic.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:28.273 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back a
million years and you talk

00:33:28.273 --> 00:33:31.376 align:middle line:84%
to a humanoid --
roughly the same DNA --

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.711 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't know
what you're saying.

00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:35.447 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not awake to
the magic that you're using

00:33:35.447 --> 00:33:37.282 align:middle line:84%
by controlling your
throat chakra.

00:33:37.282 --> 00:33:38.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:33:38.617 --> 00:33:39.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: And this isn't a
new idea, this has been going

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:42.154 align:middle line:84%
around for a few hundred
years now as an idea.

00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:44.556 align:middle line:84%
Is that when we use -- when
we take our other chakras

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:46.525 align:middle line:84%
under conscious control,
we can do all sorts

00:33:46.525 --> 00:33:48.627 align:middle line:84%
of what looked like
magic with them.

00:33:48.627 --> 00:33:49.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Mm-hmm.

00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:53.198 align:middle line:84%
Mm-hmm. And it's all
accessible to all of us.

00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:54.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: Well it's
worth playing.

00:33:54.199 --> 00:33:55.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's worth playing.

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:59.538 align:middle line:84%
Yeah do you have a last little
practical exercise for us?

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Evans: I think that what
I'd like to do is just take you

00:34:01.607 --> 00:34:03.775 align:middle line:84%
through another breathing
technique, which is really nice.

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:07.813 align:middle line:84%
And this is a great breathing
technique for getting ideas.

00:34:07.813 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean now what you do is
you imagine the breath starts

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:13.151 align:middle line:84%
in your coccyx, or the
bottom here of your spine.

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Now on the in breath
you breathe up.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.257 align:middle line:84%
So the breath comes up right
down the outside of your spine,

00:34:18.257 --> 00:34:19.992 align:middle line:90%
past your neck to your crown.

00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:22.327 align:middle line:84%
And on the out breath, you
mentioned the breath is going

00:34:22.327 --> 00:34:23.795 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of your spine.

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The inside of your body
right down to the coccyx.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.033 align:middle line:90%
So in breath on the outside.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.401 align:middle line:84%
Out breath on the
inside of your body.

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.836 align:middle line:84%
And you do that in
a circular way.

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:35.439 align:middle line:84%
And you do that about sort of
7 -- it has to be 7 or 9 times.

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:37.142 align:middle line:90%
See your numbers are important.

00:34:37.142 --> 00:34:39.878 align:middle line:84%
Before you start another
-- any creative task.

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:42.147 align:middle line:84%
You've find the most amazing
enlightful moment will just

00:34:42.147 --> 00:34:43.481 align:middle line:90%
pop in.

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:44.883 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:34:44.883 --> 00:34:47.452 align:middle line:84%
It works. You've got to breathe
anyway, so why not breathe --

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.354 align:middle line:84%
you're imagining
the breath is coming

00:34:49.354 --> 00:34:50.522 align:middle line:90%
around in a circular breath --

00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:52.557 align:middle line:84%
it's called the inspirational
breath.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:53.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yeah.

00:34:53.792 --> 00:34:55.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Thank you.

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:55.894 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for this
delicious conversation Tom!

00:34:55.894 --> 00:34:56.595 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Thank you.

00:34:56.595 --> 00:34:57.996 align:middle line:90%
It's been very juicy.

00:34:57.996 --> 00:34:58.997 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: [Chuckles] juicy!

00:34:58.997 --> 00:35:00.432 align:middle line:90%
Conscious -- super-conscious!

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.834 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, my beautiful
co-creators,

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:05.704 align:middle line:84%
sending you so much
love from England.

00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:06.572 align:middle line:90%
England. England.

00:35:06.572 --> 00:35:07.873 align:middle line:90%
England. London.

00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:10.042 align:middle line:84%
There is not -- it's
not raining right now.

00:35:10.042 --> 00:35:11.376 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a lot
of sun today.

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:11.944 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:12.611 align:middle line:90%
>> Evans: Yes.

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:13.679 align:middle line:90%
Well the sun shines

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:16.081 align:middle line:84%
on the righteous they
say, doesn't they?

00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:19.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: [Chuckles] I hope
you receive this and you're --

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:20.219 align:middle line:90%
you're doing well [music].

00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:21.053 align:middle line:90%
Big, big kisses.

00:35:21.053 --> 00:35:22.054 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.
