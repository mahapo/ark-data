00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:14.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, delicious co-creators
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.884 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Paris, beautiful
amazing Paris

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.385 align:middle line:90%
in France with Mira Kelley.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.221 align:middle line:90%
How exciting is this.

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:21.489 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.391 align:middle line:84%
>> It really is very exciting
that we should meet her.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like life
is really magical.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.496 align:middle line:90%
And it is, and we know it.

00:00:28.496 --> 00:00:30.865 align:middle line:84%
Your own stories
really proof of that.

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:34.368 align:middle line:84%
It was introduced to you through
Wayne Dyer, Dr. Wayne Dyer

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.403 align:middle line:90%
that I had introduced in Maui.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.874 align:middle line:84%
And you've been doing amazing
work all around the world.

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:41.776 align:middle line:90%
You live the life transform.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:45.579 align:middle line:84%
I mean you had yourself a
huge transformation you were.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.749 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really excited to speak
about past life regression.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.386 align:middle line:84%
And this is not the topic
that we often speak of.

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:55.389 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've
heard of the work

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.225 align:middle line:84%
of Brian Weiss and
Dolores Cannon.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:00.461 align:middle line:84%
And you have studied
with both of them.

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.795 align:middle line:90%
You used to be a lawyer.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.264 align:middle line:90%
You used to live in Bulgaria.

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.833 align:middle line:84%
Now, you live in New
York, oh my goodness.

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:08.269 align:middle line:84%
And you had so many life
transforming stories,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.004 align:middle line:90%
instant healing.

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:11.472 align:middle line:84%
We're going to speak
of all this.

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:12.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:13.007 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exciting.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:13.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.309 align:middle line:90%
It really is exciting.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:19.547 align:middle line:84%
I say to people how I live a
life of charm synchronicities.

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, thank you, I'm very
happy to be sharing with you.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.719 align:middle line:84%
>> When did those
synchronicities started

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.487 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:27.721 align:middle line:90%
I know you had an amazing

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.157 align:middle line:84%
in past life regression
at the age of 13.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.693 align:middle line:84%
Is it really when things
started to click and you felt

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:36.764 align:middle line:84%
on this journey or was it on and
off and suddenly, you took off?

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:39.599 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I grew up
in a communist country.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.367 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in communist Bulgaria.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.672 align:middle line:84%
So, just like you said,
I was 13 years old

00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:47.675 align:middle line:84%
when I did my first
best life regression.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:52.879 align:middle line:84%
And back then, because of
the way I grew up I didn't--

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
religion wasn't part of
my life, angels, miracles,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.053 align:middle line:84%
none of that was
part of my life.

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:04.825 align:middle line:84%
And so, when the communist
regime fell, all of the sudden,

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:08.395 align:middle line:84%
there was such a hunger
in people for this kind

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.732 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual information
because it wasn't part

00:02:11.732 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of their lives before that.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.136 align:middle line:84%
So, that-- all of the sudden
people will be talking

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:20.541 align:middle line:84%
about UFOs and poltergeist,
"I'm going to church on Sunday,"

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.643 align:middle line:90%
in the very same conversation.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.711 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
was no discernment

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.549 align:middle line:84%
between what is possible
and what is not possible.

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.318 align:middle line:84%
So, it was that kind
of environment

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:36.824 align:middle line:84%
in which I actually receive
my very first past life

00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:38.225 align:middle line:90%
regression book.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:41.729 align:middle line:84%
My uncle was reading a book by
Brian Weiss called "Through Time

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.999 align:middle line:84%
Into Healing" and he just
mentioned how good it is.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.036 align:middle line:84%
And is if something
a sense of urgency.

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:49.737 align:middle line:90%
It was in me.

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:51.005 align:middle line:90%
I really remember it.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.141 align:middle line:84%
I was begging him to give
it to me so I can read it.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So, I get a way to
read the book.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.247 align:middle line:84%
And when I read it, I was
honestly so intrigued.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:04.551 align:middle line:84%
How it possible that people
will change their lives?

00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:10.557 align:middle line:84%
People will resolve lifelong
questions for all these issues,

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:15.729 align:middle line:84%
physical healings just by
connecting with another lifetime

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.198 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a story
in their mind.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.168 align:middle line:84%
And like I said to
you, I didn't know

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:24.004 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't have
a predisposition

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:25.572 align:middle line:90%
if this is real or not.

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:27.841 align:middle line:90%
I was just taking on face value.

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.778 align:middle line:84%
So, at the end of the
book, there was a script.

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:33.614 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded the
script on a tape.

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It was so very kind of
brand to you have included

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.151 align:middle line:90%
as script in his book.

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.454 align:middle line:90%
And I recorded on the tape.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.455 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thirteen.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Thirteen, exactly.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was playing--
I was rewarding the tape,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.167 align:middle line:84%
you know, how those things
used to work and I was thinking

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:57.204 align:middle line:84%
to myself, "I'm 13, there's
nothing wrong with me."

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:58.672 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any phobias.

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I have no ailments
but I was so curious.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.412 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to
experience this.

00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:08.949 align:middle line:90%
So, I played the recording

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.252 align:middle line:84%
and I immediately
drop into a lifetime.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:14.988 align:middle line:90%
And I immediately saw myself

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.324 align:middle line:84%
as this other woman
as this other person.

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:20.894 align:middle line:84%
And because my very first
regression that has been

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:84%
so vivid, so powerful,
so transformative.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.837 align:middle line:84%
From there on, I have to tell
you, there was never a question

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:34.208 align:middle line:84%
in my mind if this is
real or if this not.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:36.844 align:middle line:84%
You know, I just
never questioned it.

00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:39.713 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you feel
something, you feel it

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:43.016 align:middle line:84%
and you know it and you don't
need any proof beyond that.

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:45.152 align:middle line:90%
It was that kind of experience.

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:48.622 align:middle line:84%
And it really impacted, really
impacted me, it gave me a sense

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:49.857 align:middle line:90%
of my purpose in life.

00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
It gave me a sense of who
I am and why I'm here.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.598 align:middle line:84%
And then, my life kept on going
as any other kids' life,

00:04:57.598 --> 00:05:00.401 align:middle line:84%
you know, I graduated from
high school, I went to college,

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I went to law school, and I was
already living in New York City,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.177 align:middle line:84%
and I was already working
as a corporate lawyer.

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:15.149 align:middle line:84%
When regression again powerfully
came back into my life, again,

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.719 align:middle line:84%
in a very dramatic way,
should I tell you the story?

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:19.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:19.553 --> 00:05:20.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I remember

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.089 align:middle line:84%
because we already
had an interview

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:90%
and this is really exciting

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.593 align:middle line:84%
because I was wondering what
happened between the two,

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:27.928 align:middle line:90%
nothing, no past life--

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:30.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing, much of nothing,
you know, because meanwhile,

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:34.468 align:middle line:84%
I was just busy getting my
life and/or pursuing a career.

00:05:34.468 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I was really busy just living.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.839 align:middle line:84%
I was doing what
everybody else would.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.675 align:middle line:84%
So, in between, there was
really none much in terms

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.677 align:middle line:90%
of past life regression.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.813 align:middle line:84%
So, I was already
living in New York

00:05:45.813 --> 00:05:47.748 align:middle line:90%
and I had some dental work done

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:50.918 align:middle line:84%
and the dentist was
very reputable and

00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:53.654 align:middle line:84%
yet he really messed
up things in my life.

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.489 align:middle line:84%
It was a simple changing
of filling,

00:05:55.489 --> 00:05:58.258 align:middle line:84%
nothing extraordinary,
now, right?

00:05:58.258 --> 00:06:00.994 align:middle line:84%
But by the way, he was just
suggesting the filling to fit

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.463 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of my teeth.

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:06.433 align:middle line:84%
He really messed up the balance
in my mouth because, you know,

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:09.503 align:middle line:84%
there is a balance with
your jaw and muscles.

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:11.538 align:middle line:90%
And he really messed that up.

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:16.577 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I actually
developed a TMJ condition.

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:20.614 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't just, you
know, a mild TMJ condition.

00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:24.485 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really severe.

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:28.856 align:middle line:84%
So much so that I was
constantly in pain right here

00:06:28.856 --> 00:06:31.091 align:middle line:90%
in my shoulders and in my neck.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.392 align:middle line:84%
And for those who don't
know, I should say

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that TMJ is really a
condition of that muscles

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.867 align:middle line:84%
of the jaw that's
all there is to it.

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.736 align:middle line:84%
They're inflamated and they're
in pain

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:43.937 align:middle line:90%
and they're clenching

00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.873 align:middle line:84%
and they're just seeking
enlightenment and comfort.

00:06:45.873 --> 00:06:47.741 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's very, very painful.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.212 align:middle line:84%
I had to-- just to
show you how--

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:54.848 align:middle line:84%
just to share with you
how dramatic it was,

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I had to change my bed.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.784 align:middle line:90%
I had to change my pillow.

00:06:57.784 --> 00:06:59.753 align:middle line:84%
I have to constantly
take pain pills.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:02.189 align:middle line:90%
I had to eat a different diet.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.057 align:middle line:84%
I had to sleep with
a night guard.

00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.159 align:middle line:90%
I-- it was just awful.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.097 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even put a spoon
full of food in my mouth.

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So you get the picture,
it was severe.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.303 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I
changed my doctor.

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:17.938 align:middle line:90%
I changed my dentist.

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:23.977 align:middle line:84%
And after a whole year of going
to the dentist once a week

00:07:23.977 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and seeing a physical
therapist three times a week,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.616 align:middle line:84%
you can just imagine how
this was draining me,

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.885 align:middle line:84%
not only physically
and emotionally

00:07:31.885 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:90%
but also my bank account, right?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.289 align:middle line:90%
You can imagine that.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.995 align:middle line:84%
So, after a whole year of this,
one day, my dentist sat me down

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:45.966 align:middle line:84%
and he said to me, "Mira,
we need to be realistic.

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:84%
You either need to-- we
need to stop this, right?

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:53.273 align:middle line:84%
And you either need to learn to
live with this pain for the rest

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:57.778 align:middle line:84%
of your life or you have
to have an operation."

00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:01.214 align:middle line:84%
So, I asked him what the
operation is about and he--

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.917 align:middle line:84%
here is what he said,
honestly, he said, "We're going

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.953 align:middle line:84%
to break your jaw
and then we going

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:08.188 align:middle line:90%
to reattach it with wires."

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.791 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I was thinking
to myself,

00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:14.995 align:middle line:84%
how this breaking my jaw fix
the muscles around the jaw,

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:19.565 align:middle line:84%
you know, like it's-- it
just doesn't make sense.

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:24.738 align:middle line:84%
So, I walked out of his
office completely desperate.

00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:28.875 align:middle line:84%
I was just so desperate
for a solution.

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
And talking synchronicities,
I had arranged

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.215 align:middle line:84%
to go see the physical therapist
right after this appointment.

00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:39.319 align:middle line:84%
So, I walked into the
physical therapist all gloomy

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.921 align:middle line:90%
and just completely lost.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.759 align:middle line:84%
And the owner of the office
was sitting behind the desk

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.127 align:middle line:90%
and he greeted me.

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:84%
And he was so cheerful, he was
so happy, and he said to me,

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:55.335 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, yes, me and my wife are
leaving for Hawaii tomorrow

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.638 align:middle line:90%
on our two-week vacation."

00:08:57.638 --> 00:09:00.173 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't say anything
to him any of these.

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:05.512 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, I went from
sad to mad in a split second.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:08.749 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him and
I was thinking to myself,

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:12.152 align:middle line:84%
"You're going to Hawaii, oh
no, the money I gave you,

00:09:12.152 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and here I am, I haven't
improved a little bit

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm facing a lifetime
of pain or an operation

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.664 align:middle line:84%
and here you are, are
going to Hawaii and--

00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:25.799 align:middle line:90%
oh he's wanted to go to Hawaii

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.402 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't really
helped me."

00:09:28.402 --> 00:09:30.003 align:middle line:90%
So, you can just imagine.

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:32.439 align:middle line:90%
I-- and in that moment,

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:35.976 align:middle line:84%
I realized that it's
my job to heal myself.

00:09:35.976 --> 00:09:39.746 align:middle line:84%
It's really up to me
to find the solution.

00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:42.015 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know where to go.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:46.553 align:middle line:84%
And within-- and as I was lying
on the massage table, you know,

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:50.057 align:middle line:84%
and very-- my mind was raising
and I was thinking to myself,

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.893 align:middle line:84%
"I got to think of something,
I got to do something."

00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:56.997 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the regression I
did when I was 13 years old.

00:09:56.997 --> 00:10:00.067 align:middle line:84%
And it clicked in my mind
and I knew that I had

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:02.736 align:middle line:84%
to do past life regression
hoping

00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:05.872 align:middle line:84%
that somehow seeing another
lifetime will help me.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:08.008 align:middle line:90%
So that's how, you know,

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
regression came right
back into my life.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.346 align:middle line:90%
>> And how old were you then?

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.147 align:middle line:90%
When was that?

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:15.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:19.653 align:middle line:84%
I was 27. So, it's been
quite a big gap in years and

00:10:19.653 --> 00:10:23.256 align:middle line:84%
yet it just popped right into
my mind the moment I needed

00:10:23.256 --> 00:10:24.791 align:middle line:90%
that guidance.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.127 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
always is with people.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:30.597 align:middle line:84%
We are always given that which
we need exactly when we need it.

00:10:30.597 --> 00:10:31.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:34.768 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, I very quickly
found the practitioner.

00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And within a few days,
I went to see her.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.973 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's very
important for me to say this,

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:43.610 align:middle line:84%
the first time I saw her,
I didn't see anything just

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.045 align:middle line:90%
because there was this moment

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:49.616 align:middle line:84%
of this session lasting only one
hour unlike the work I do these

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:51.651 align:middle line:90%
days, which is much longer.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:55.756 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have a sense
of comfort with that woman.

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have a sense of just--

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.394 align:middle line:84%
so really, I didn't
see anything.

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:05.932 align:middle line:84%
But I needed a solution so I
went back and I'm so glad I did.

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:09.636 align:middle line:84%
Because of the second
time I went to see her,

00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:12.339 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience,
which, honestly,

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.374 align:middle line:90%
lasted, oh, but a flash.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:17.577 align:middle line:84%
I saw myself as a very
tall, very strong,

00:11:17.577 --> 00:11:20.781 align:middle line:84%
very powerful slave,
physically powerful.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.216 align:middle line:84%
And there was this metal
collar around my neck.

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And there were-- these metal
cufflinks around my wrist

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.758 align:middle line:84%
and my-- around my ankles and
a big chain connecting them all

00:11:31.758 --> 00:11:34.594 align:middle line:84%
and they were permanently
on my body as this man.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And the metal collar
was so thick,

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.967 align:middle line:84%
so heavy that is was always
rubbing right against my jaw,

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:43.970 align:middle line:84%
right where the main
pain spot was.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.773 align:middle line:84%
And there was this sense
of complete powerlessness.

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:51.878 align:middle line:84%
There was this sense of, even
though I'm so physically strong,

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.447 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely broken.

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:57.584 align:middle line:90%
My spirit is broken.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:03.156 align:middle line:84%
And I also saw a flash of the
masters that this man had.

00:12:03.156 --> 00:12:07.427 align:middle line:84%
And I was so grateful to these
people for even feeding me.

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:11.431 align:middle line:84%
Lilou, how could you be grateful
for someone having chained you

00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:13.066 align:middle line:90%
and they have been feeding you.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
That tells you the sense of
just complete powerlessness

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.673 align:middle line:90%
in the sense of having been lost

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:23.243 align:middle line:84%
to who you are, to
your true nature.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:27.647 align:middle line:90%
And that I came out of

00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:31.017 align:middle line:84%
that session thinking what
does it mean to be powerful

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.619 align:middle line:84%
because there was
such a dichotomy

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.522 align:middle line:84%
between the physically
strong body

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:38.391 align:middle line:90%
and between the weak spirit.

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:42.195 align:middle line:90%
And I asked the practitioner,

00:12:42.195 --> 00:12:44.331 align:middle line:84%
"What does it mean
to be powerful?"

00:12:44.331 --> 00:12:47.367 align:middle line:84%
And then like the work that I
do today, she just looked at me

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.236 align:middle line:90%
and she said to me, "Well,

00:12:49.236 --> 00:12:51.671 align:middle line:84%
you got to discover
that on your own."

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:56.409 align:middle line:84%
So I pretty much left her office
crying for the rest of the day,

00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:01.081 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was just really
just in tears crying and trying

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:04.818 align:middle line:84%
to figure it out and yet there's
nothing to really figure out,

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:07.854 align:middle line:84%
these lessons and these
pieces arranged themselves,

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:09.322 align:middle line:84%
always on the back
of your mind just

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:12.092 align:middle line:84%
because you have presented
the question in my case.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:12.626 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:13.627 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:14.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, 'cause that's
what we hear.

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.564 align:middle line:84%
Once you relieved those past
events, then they're released

00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:19.266 align:middle line:84%
and there is noting
really to do, right?

00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:21.835 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly the
magic of this work.

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:25.272 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
I love about it so much.

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:28.575 align:middle line:84%
And so as I said to you,
for the rest of the day,

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:30.243 align:middle line:90%
I was basically crying.

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.513 align:middle line:84%
And here is the miracle,
of the next morning,

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:36.583 align:middle line:90%
I woke up there was no pain.

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:90%
The pain in my jaw was gone.

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:44.224 align:middle line:84%
And a few days later, I
went back to the dentist

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:46.626 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't know
what to make out of it.

00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:49.296 align:middle line:84%
He just said, "Oh,
this is a miracle."

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:52.265 align:middle line:90%
And he just left it at that

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.335 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't give
him any explanation.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.037 align:middle line:90%
And listen to this back then,

00:13:57.037 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really feel comfortable
with my spirituality.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.709 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was good enough
that I healed, right?

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:05.578 align:middle line:84%
Why should I prorate
with it or talk about it?

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:08.782 align:middle line:84%
It's-- that's where I
was in my own feelings

00:14:08.782 --> 00:14:10.383 align:middle line:90%
about my own spirituality.

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:15.121 align:middle line:84%
So, him and I lose
touch over the years.

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:18.325 align:middle line:84%
And about seven years later,
just a few months ago,

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.694 align:middle line:90%
I went to see him again.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:24.798 align:middle line:90%
And he asked me how is my jaw.

00:14:24.798 --> 00:14:28.368 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, all these
seven years in between,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:33.273 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had any pain,
nothing has come up.

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:37.043 align:middle line:84%
And for a split second, I even
talked to myself, "My jaw,

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.647 align:middle line:84%
my jaw-- why would I
tell you-- oh, my jaw."

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:43.783 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wasn't even
something I was even

00:14:43.783 --> 00:14:45.285 align:middle line:90%
thinking about.

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:47.187 align:middle line:90%
So, I said to him, "Well,

00:14:47.187 --> 00:14:49.889 align:middle line:84%
I never told you the
story of how I healed.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.092 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me tell you the story."

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:55.662 align:middle line:90%
And I told him.

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:59.199 align:middle line:84%
And the real reason
why I didn't--

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:01.568 align:middle line:84%
part of the reason why
I didn't say anything

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:05.038 align:middle line:84%
to him back then is also because
I didn't know how he was going

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:06.773 align:middle line:90%
to react, right?

00:15:06.773 --> 00:15:09.242 align:middle line:84%
Because these topics are
not something people feel

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.711 align:middle line:84%
comfortable discussing
with everyone.

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.914 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, when he heard
me say what I said,

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:18.551 align:middle line:90%
he said to me, "You know what?

00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:20.253 align:middle line:90%
I often go to Jerusalem.

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.856 align:middle line:84%
And when I go to the
old city of Jerusalem,

00:15:22.856 --> 00:15:25.191 align:middle line:84%
I always have this
feeling that I know it,

00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:90%
like I've been here before.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.261 align:middle line:90%
I just know it."

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.965 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Wow,
maybe I could have spoken

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:33.233 align:middle line:90%
to you about these things."

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:36.636 align:middle line:84%
It was just me projecting
on to you, right?

00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:44.677 align:middle line:84%
And so then he said to me, "You
know, Mira, we should talk."

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, "I'm opening a
TMJ clinic," because my case was

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:52.485 align:middle line:84%
so extreme that he had to buy
a whole lot of new equipment

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.954 align:middle line:84%
and he had to learn
a whole lot of stuff

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.991 align:middle line:84%
that he has really
been preparing himself

00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:01.294 align:middle line:84%
to open a clinic about
healing this condition.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.396 align:middle line:84%
I was that patient
that created that--

00:16:03.396 --> 00:16:04.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:04.164 --> 00:16:05.532 align:middle line:90%
>> -- opportunity for him.

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:08.201 align:middle line:84%
>> So even your madness for him
going to Hawaii and thinking

00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:12.038 align:middle line:84%
of himself and being selfish
was out of light but anyway.

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:15.241 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know,
so he said to me,

00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:18.645 align:middle line:84%
"I am actually thinking
of opening a clinic.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:21.147 align:middle line:84%
We should talk and we
should work together."

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, "Wow,
this is incredible."

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.287 align:middle line:84%
So, I felt in a way that
was completion of a circle

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:30.457 align:middle line:84%
in a way everything has
resolved and healed.

00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:34.994 align:middle line:84%
So this is such a beautiful
example of what is possible

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:37.564 align:middle line:84%
through this work
and what I've seen

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:39.499 align:middle line:90%
with myself and with others.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so you became
a full-time practitioner

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:44.571 align:middle line:84%
at some point after
that experience.

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:48.475 align:middle line:84%
And you must have gone
through and experienced many,

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:49.909 align:middle line:90%
many different healings.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:53.346 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think those event
thought pop like your jaw

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:56.182 align:middle line:84%
of sudden start hurting
and you had this?

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:59.152 align:middle line:84%
Why then, you know,
why did it happen?

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.854 align:middle line:90%
Why does it pop those events?

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.022 align:middle line:90%
Does it there for our healing?

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:05.725 align:middle line:84%
>> I really love that you're
asking this question because,

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:10.363 align:middle line:84%
you know, these lifetimes that
we see, they are never random.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:14.834 align:middle line:84%
So, they are never just randomly
picked by your subconscious

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:19.172 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a fun story
to tell at a dinner party.

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:23.076 align:middle line:84%
I believed that this
work is orchestrated

00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:26.146 align:middle line:84%
in a much more incredible
and divine way.

00:17:26.146 --> 00:17:29.015 align:middle line:84%
And people are always given
that, which will serve them

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:32.685 align:middle line:84%
and guide them in the
best possible way.

00:17:32.685 --> 00:17:36.623 align:middle line:84%
So that this makes
sense, let me tell you

00:17:36.623 --> 00:17:38.424 align:middle line:84%
about the example
I just gave you

00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.894 align:middle line:84%
with my own jaw and
my own healing.

00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:43.897 align:middle line:84%
Back then, I was
working as a lawyer

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.999 align:middle line:90%
and I was a junior attorney.

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:48.735 align:middle line:84%
I was a young attorney
in my law firm.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:57.443 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I had this very
similar situation happened

00:17:57.443 --> 00:18:01.381 align:middle line:84%
energetically and emotionally
as the slave in my job.

00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I was asking that I received a
raise so that my salary is equal

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.923 align:middle line:84%
to everybody else who
was working there.

00:18:09.923 --> 00:18:13.226 align:middle line:84%
And my answer-- the
answer I received was no.

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:16.863 align:middle line:84%
I was asking that I have my own
office even though there were

00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:18.431 align:middle line:90%
few available offices.

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:21.034 align:middle line:84%
The answer I received
was, again, a no.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:25.705 align:middle line:84%
And even though these were very
reasonable requests looking

00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:28.942 align:middle line:84%
back, because, you
know, I was working just

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:30.777 align:middle line:90%
as mush as everybody else.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.379 align:middle line:84%
I-- every time there
was a review of my work,

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:34.848 align:middle line:90%
it was always excellent.

00:18:34.848 --> 00:18:37.784 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was always looking
to have me on their team

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.386 align:middle line:84%
to represent our
clients back then.

00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:42.989 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I asked
for the salary raise,

00:18:42.989 --> 00:18:44.624 align:middle line:84%
it was not even done
much little.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:49.762 align:middle line:84%
It was more about that
feeling within me of wanting

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:53.499 align:middle line:90%
to be equal to everybody else.

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:56.102 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm they
asking was coming from.

00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:58.671 align:middle line:84%
The few hundred dollars
a month was not going

00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:00.673 align:middle line:90%
to make any huge difference.

00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:05.411 align:middle line:84%
So, I was really
shocked and perplexed

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.481 align:middle line:84%
that how my employer
was really turning me

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.885 align:middle line:84%
into a very disgruntled
employee, you know,

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:15.054 align:middle line:84%
because I was so loyal,
so devoted, so passionate

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:18.057 align:middle line:84%
about the work and yet
they were saying no.

00:19:18.057 --> 00:19:20.593 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wait, you're
not taking care of me.

00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:22.195 align:middle line:90%
I'm good to you and you're not--

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:24.597 align:middle line:84%
and so it was that
kind of a situation,

00:19:24.597 --> 00:19:28.134 align:middle line:84%
very much the slave
repeating the story, right?

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:31.871 align:middle line:84%
So that I'd find within myself
that sense of empowerment.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:35.675 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this came
to my life, this condition

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.644 align:middle line:84%
so that I can look
for the solution,

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:40.647 align:middle line:90%
for the emotional solution

00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:43.716 align:middle line:84%
because our body really
always speaks to us

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:46.919 align:middle line:84%
through the pains
and aches we have.

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
The body is really just being a
kind of partner that is saying

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.226 align:middle line:84%
to us, "This is hurting because
you need to pay attention.

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:54.727 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention, dig into this,

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:57.697 align:middle line:84%
understand the message
we're delivering to you."

00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:59.899 align:middle line:90%
And the jaw represents speaking.

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:02.669 align:middle line:84%
The jaw represents that
moment of feeling empowered

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:90%
and standing up for yourself.

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:08.574 align:middle line:84%
So, after I did this
regression, I came to realize

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:84%
that power is not the way I have
studied in school, you know,

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.914 align:middle line:84%
it's not about one
dominating another.

00:20:14.914 --> 00:20:18.384 align:middle line:84%
It really is about your own
sense of knowing yourself

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.821 align:middle line:84%
and being strong within
your own sense of awareness,

00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:24.991 align:middle line:84%
being in tuned and in
touch with your own truth.

00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:28.928 align:middle line:84%
And being empowered is not about
controlling someone because,

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's really
powerlessness when you need

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.967 align:middle line:84%
to impose your will
on somebody else.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:38.371 align:middle line:84%
It really is about
within yourself feelings

00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:43.042 align:middle line:84%
so aligned knowing your power
so much that it's very much

00:20:43.042 --> 00:20:44.744 align:middle line:90%
to way God knows power.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:48.081 align:middle line:84%
We don't see God our-- being
busy around and creating.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:49.148 align:middle line:90%
It's all seamless.

00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:52.018 align:middle line:84%
It's all with that
little move of a finger.

00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:55.621 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of creations,
that kind of ability to bring

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:57.690 align:middle line:90%
about that which you want.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.727 align:middle line:84%
So, these are all the
realizations that came to me

00:21:00.727 --> 00:21:02.095 align:middle line:90%
over the years, right?

00:21:02.095 --> 00:21:03.629 align:middle line:90%
It was an instant.

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:07.033 align:middle line:84%
The healing was instance
because I allowed for it.

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:84%
And then back of
my mind it clicked.

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:14.207 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I can very
easily go and get another job.

00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:15.675 align:middle line:90%
It's that easy.

00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:18.211 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to be
have this the sense

00:21:18.211 --> 00:21:20.613 align:middle line:90%
of being under appreciated.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.583 align:middle line:84%
But then, I also realized
that I love the people I work

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:26.786 align:middle line:84%
with just because, you know,
the CFO of the law firm,

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:28.488 align:middle line:90%
it has the different opinion.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:90%
I still love my colleagues.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:38.731 align:middle line:84%
And also-- and so this is the
kind of connection there is

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:40.299 align:middle line:90%
between the two lives.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:43.002 align:middle line:84%
And once that all become
clear to me that it's really

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:47.006 align:middle line:84%
about me valuing myself and me
feeling equal to everybody else

00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:49.809 align:middle line:84%
because nobody from the outside
will come in and tell you, "Oh,

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.945 align:middle line:84%
no, but you're equal
to everybody else."

00:21:52.945 --> 00:21:55.548 align:middle line:84%
That's, really, when it
all clicked so perfectly

00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:57.417 align:middle line:90%
on the back of my mind.

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:59.719 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
instant as I said to you.

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:03.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And then, later on you
decided to so this permanently

00:22:03.556 --> 00:22:06.025 align:middle line:90%
and go even deeper into this.

00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:09.796 align:middle line:84%
>> So, because it was so
beautifully arranged for me

00:22:09.796 --> 00:22:13.533 align:middle line:84%
to have these experiences
so rapidly.

00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:16.803 align:middle line:84%
As you can imagine from there
on, I wanted to read every book,

00:22:16.803 --> 00:22:19.105 align:middle line:84%
every to go every
possible seminar

00:22:19.105 --> 00:22:22.008 align:middle line:84%
because I was really
intrigued by this.

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:25.845 align:middle line:84%
And of course, every friend
and every family member

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:28.681 align:middle line:84%
who would say to me,
"Oh, this is my problem."

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I would say to them, "Well,
let's do a regression," because,

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.053 align:middle line:90%
you know, I knew the answer.

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:38.257 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't trained
with anybody by that time.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:40.259 align:middle line:84%
I haven't study then
with anybody.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:42.228 align:middle line:84%
I was just again using
the little script

00:22:42.228 --> 00:22:43.729 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the book.

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:46.632 align:middle line:84%
But their was a sense within
me of feeling very comfortable

00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:48.434 align:middle line:90%
with this, feeling very--

00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:49.936 align:middle line:90%
>> At ease.

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:52.605 align:middle line:84%
>> At ease, yeah, because
the truth of it is that, yes,

00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
people can teach you something.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.743 align:middle line:84%
And yet that sense of
comfort comes from within you.

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.812 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you
do interviews.

00:22:59.812 --> 00:23:01.647 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn
about technology,

00:23:01.647 --> 00:23:03.883 align:middle line:84%
you to learn about
this and that.

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:06.819 align:middle line:84%
But at the bottom of
it, oh, is your comfort

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.855 align:middle line:84%
and you're excitement
to do this.

00:23:08.855 --> 00:23:11.757 align:middle line:84%
And your connection with
it, your joy when doing it.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:15.695 align:middle line:84%
So, it was the same
way with me and I was--

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:19.298 align:middle line:84%
for the longest time, I was
still working as a lawyer.

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.068 align:middle line:84%
And these were my
interest on the side.

00:23:22.068 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
began seeing clients

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.641 align:middle line:84%
and some quite incredible
things, it happened.

00:23:28.641 --> 00:23:32.145 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was my
connection with Wayne Dyer,

00:23:32.145 --> 00:23:33.279 align:middle line:90%
how the two of us meet.

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.782 align:middle line:90%
>> What an amazing man.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:39.252 align:middle line:84%
I knew he went through
a lot himself

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:42.788 align:middle line:84%
with his leukemia
and just so, so much.

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:46.626 align:middle line:84%
This-- does those healing
really happen all the time

00:23:46.626 --> 00:23:50.096 align:middle line:84%
because I guess part
of us also hold back.

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:53.599 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not quite ready
or it's quite interesting

00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.401 align:middle line:84%
to see how events
pop in our life

00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.270 align:middle line:84%
but also how's sometimes
we resist.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.804 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they keep
on coming back

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:01.574 align:middle line:84%
and how all this
dynamic of freewill.

00:24:01.574 --> 00:24:04.911 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
destiny plays out.

00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:06.178 align:middle line:90%
What is your understanding

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:09.482 align:middle line:84%
of how we even create
our reality or, you know,

00:24:09.482 --> 00:24:13.886 align:middle line:84%
or is even past live
regression for everybody.

00:24:13.886 --> 00:24:16.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's really interesting
that you're saying this.

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:19.125 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
comments I could make

00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.793 align:middle line:84%
about everything
that you mentioned.

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I really love this question
because, you know, in truth, I--

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
for one I do want to
encourage everybody

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.635 align:middle line:90%
to try past life regression.

00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:32.805 align:middle line:84%
In terms of just really
exploring and answering

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:36.342 align:middle line:84%
and connecting because the level
of understanding is so profound,

00:24:36.342 --> 00:24:40.846 align:middle line:84%
so deep that no other work
can really deliver this.

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And from there on, would
everybody heal instantly

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.952 align:middle line:90%
through past life regression.

00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:49.989 align:middle line:84%
You said that we're freewill
and I really believe in that.

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.758 align:middle line:84%
So, what happen is--
and this really happens

00:24:52.758 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
with every healer.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.196 align:middle line:84%
When a person comes to me,
I know that they are going

00:24:57.196 --> 00:25:00.032 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience that
what I don't know is what the

00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:03.302 align:middle line:84%
experience will be like because
every session is so different,

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:07.173 align:middle line:84%
so unique, so perfect
for where the person is.

00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:12.778 align:middle line:84%
And from there on, I hold the
person in the whole session

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:15.114 align:middle line:84%
in our coming together
in this energy

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:17.083 align:middle line:90%
of them being perfect health.

00:25:17.083 --> 00:25:20.186 align:middle line:84%
This energy of them already
being this other person

00:25:20.186 --> 00:25:23.022 align:middle line:84%
where everything is already
released because, you know,

00:25:23.022 --> 00:25:24.824 align:middle line:90%
that reality already exist.

00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:28.594 align:middle line:84%
That parallel reality of them
having transformed and shifted

00:25:28.594 --> 00:25:33.099 align:middle line:84%
and allowed for all this things
to be let go of already exist.

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:36.602 align:middle line:84%
So, me, as the regression
is I'm holding them

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:39.805 align:middle line:84%
in that perfect energy
that perfect space.

00:25:39.805 --> 00:25:43.476 align:middle line:84%
And through this experience
they can allow themselves

00:25:43.476 --> 00:25:46.112 align:middle line:84%
to match my energy,
to match that reality

00:25:46.112 --> 00:25:48.714 align:middle line:90%
to really transform instantly.

00:25:48.714 --> 00:25:52.585 align:middle line:84%
And some people do that
and some people don't.

00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:54.887 align:middle line:84%
That's really for
they are so tough

00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:57.089 align:middle line:90%
and so purpose to decide, right?

00:25:57.089 --> 00:26:01.927 align:middle line:84%
For that whole thing to
come together but even

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:07.133 align:middle line:84%
if the person is not fully able
and ready to let go completely.

00:26:07.133 --> 00:26:10.503 align:middle line:84%
The regression that they
would do with me or really

00:26:10.503 --> 00:26:13.839 align:middle line:84%
with any regression is, or
really would any recording,

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:17.109 align:middle line:84%
be at mind or anybody
else's is, again,

00:26:17.109 --> 00:26:19.712 align:middle line:90%
up step into that direction.

00:26:19.712 --> 00:26:22.415 align:middle line:84%
It still helps them put
the pieces together.

00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.884 align:middle line:90%
And allow for the healing.

00:26:24.884 --> 00:26:26.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's like
whatever we get,

00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:27.887 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what
we needed to--

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:28.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:31.357 align:middle line:84%
>> Right? This is
not perfect life is.

00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:37.229 align:middle line:84%
And do's-- because sometimes,
when you say that, we access,

00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:38.831 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
a hypnotic work.

00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:42.034 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do we do
access our subconscious.

00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:44.336 align:middle line:84%
So, where is this information
stored because we here

00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:47.339 align:middle line:84%
of akashic records so now,
you know, this and that

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:51.811 align:middle line:84%
and then our higher self
also answers some questions.

00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So, how is it all
linked together?

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.385 align:middle line:84%
What is like if you could do
a little diagram of this thing

00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
so that we could
visualize it a little bit

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.256 align:middle line:84%
because it's a bit messy
some types from the outside

00:27:04.256 --> 00:27:06.992 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have the tools
like you do as a partitioner.

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I-- OK.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.298 align:middle line:90%
So, let me see if I can this.

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:16.102 align:middle line:84%
So, when you-- when I do
regression work at the end

00:27:16.102 --> 00:27:18.604 align:middle line:84%
of the session I said, you
remember how I said to you

00:27:18.604 --> 00:27:20.239 align:middle line:84%
that unlike that
woman that I saw

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:23.476 align:middle line:84%
that I did the regression
with, my work is very different

00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:27.747 align:middle line:84%
so my work is about three, four
hours and sometimes much longer.

00:27:27.747 --> 00:27:30.983 align:middle line:84%
And to, after the person
sees as many lifetimes

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:32.885 align:middle line:84%
as makes sense I
have them connect

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:35.187 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of
their higher self.

00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:38.324 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the higher
self as that part of us

00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:41.694 align:middle line:84%
that is not focused in the
physical reality that part

00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:45.431 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, which is in a
way, sitting on a mountain top,

00:27:45.431 --> 00:27:49.435 align:middle line:84%
seeing the big picture while
we are down in the valley.

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:51.504 align:middle line:84%
And if guiding us
always directing us

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:54.106 align:middle line:84%
because it's part
of us, it's us.

00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:59.211 align:middle line:84%
And so, I connect the
person with the energy

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:90%
of their higher self and I asked

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.117 align:middle line:84%
about all the questions
they have at that moment

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
in their life about their life
purpose, about the healing

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.856 align:middle line:84%
of the body, about
the relationships

00:28:10.856 --> 00:28:13.826 align:middle line:90%
with their family members.

00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:15.961 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
beauty of this work,

00:28:15.961 --> 00:28:18.764 align:middle line:90%
it really can address anything

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:22.868 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't focus
the way taking a pill and go

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:25.738 align:middle line:84%
into a doctor, focuses
on a symptom.

00:28:25.738 --> 00:28:27.306 align:middle line:90%
It really goes beneath.

00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:29.508 align:middle line:84%
It goes underneath
to the emotions,

00:28:29.508 --> 00:28:32.745 align:middle line:84%
to the emotional healing
into the situations.

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:35.981 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
addresses everything.

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:38.217 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I connect
the person with the energy

00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:41.387 align:middle line:84%
of their higher self, they
receive this guidance,

00:28:41.387 --> 00:28:44.557 align:middle line:84%
they receive this information
on how to continue forward.

00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:47.693 align:middle line:90%
They receive these answers.

00:28:47.693 --> 00:28:52.932 align:middle line:84%
And so, I believe that
this information is--

00:28:52.932 --> 00:28:55.301 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here's the diagram.

00:28:55.301 --> 00:29:00.472 align:middle line:84%
People usually think of past
life as a linear straight line

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:05.644 align:middle line:84%
as thinks moving as the same
soul coming from a life,

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:08.214 align:middle line:84%
then going into another
life, then coming out of it,

00:29:08.214 --> 00:29:09.648 align:middle line:90%
then going into another.

00:29:09.648 --> 00:29:12.451 align:middle line:84%
And it all develops in a
straight line, you know,

00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:16.722 align:middle line:84%
prehistoric times, renaissance,
and then modern days,

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:19.091 align:middle line:90%
that kind of linear progression.

00:29:19.091 --> 00:29:21.694 align:middle line:84%
But what I have actually
learned through doing sessions

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:25.865 align:middle line:84%
like this is that time
is really simultaneous

00:29:25.865 --> 00:29:28.167 align:middle line:84%
and that these lifetimes
are really all

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:30.002 align:middle line:90%
happening simultaneously.

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:34.406 align:middle line:84%
So, a way to actually imagine
them is parallel lives,

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:36.342 align:middle line:84%
they all happening
at the same time.

00:29:36.342 --> 00:29:39.011 align:middle line:84%
The way you probably think
of as an office building

00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:42.414 align:middle line:84%
or as a very tall
apartment building.

00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:45.417 align:middle line:84%
There is people living at
the same time on every floor.

00:29:45.417 --> 00:29:48.153 align:middle line:84%
They're not aware of each
other unless you really close

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:50.656 align:middle line:84%
with you like, you know,
with your neighbors.

00:29:50.656 --> 00:29:53.058 align:middle line:84%
But they are there, they're
living their lives you just

00:29:53.058 --> 00:29:55.427 align:middle line:90%
don't know about them.

00:29:55.427 --> 00:30:01.133 align:middle line:84%
And so, what happens during
a regression is I connect the

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:05.738 align:middle line:84%
person with another lifetime
and here's how to visualize it.

00:30:05.738 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
So, I-- these lifetimes
when connecting

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.413 align:middle line:84%
and happening simultaneously,
a really part

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:16.682 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of the oversoul.

00:30:16.682 --> 00:30:20.319 align:middle line:84%
So, the higher self and the
person are really a soul.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:23.055 align:middle line:84%
Think of them is an
individual entity.

00:30:23.055 --> 00:30:26.492 align:middle line:84%
And then, think of several such
entities living these lifetimes,

00:30:26.492 --> 00:30:30.062 align:middle line:84%
right, where we call past
lifetimes or future lifetimes.

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:33.432 align:middle line:84%
And all of them come from the
same energy of the oversoul.

00:30:33.432 --> 00:30:37.236 align:middle line:84%
So, what happens is the oversoul
decides to experience lessons

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:41.373 align:middle line:84%
and says, "Well, how
about learning about love?

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:43.475 align:middle line:84%
I would love to learn
about love."

00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:47.112 align:middle line:84%
And then, the oversoul
creates energy splits of itself

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:50.082 align:middle line:84%
that it-- then create
this separate lifetime.

00:30:50.082 --> 00:30:53.285 align:middle line:84%
So, think of it as a
mother ship and out

00:30:53.285 --> 00:30:55.888 align:middle line:84%
of this mother ship come all
these little ships, right?

00:30:55.888 --> 00:31:00.426 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever transportation
device is you want to think of.

00:31:00.426 --> 00:31:03.829 align:middle line:84%
So, these little souls that come
out of the oversoul, a whole

00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:05.331 align:middle line:90%
and complete onto themselves.

00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:07.366 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing missing.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:12.905 align:middle line:84%
And into their own energy, so
then they decide, "All right,

00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:90%
we're exploring about love."

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.043 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we going
to explore about love

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:21.347 align:middle line:84%
because when you think about
it you can never really learn

00:31:21.347 --> 00:31:24.516 align:middle line:84%
about anything from
only one side.

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:84%
You need that 360 degree
learning so you can learn

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.522 align:middle line:90%
from every single perspective.

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:32.524 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn
about love by being

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:34.727 align:middle line:90%
in a very loving relationship.

00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:37.663 align:middle line:84%
You want to learn about
love by being really mean

00:31:37.663 --> 00:31:42.401 align:middle line:84%
and really controlling because
then, you learn that way too.

00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can just imagine
the different variations

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and the different ways
to explore this lesson.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So, same thing with me and
that slave that lifetime,

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.147 align:middle line:84%
that soul was learning
through about power,

00:31:55.147 --> 00:31:57.082 align:middle line:90%
through that experience.

00:31:57.082 --> 00:32:00.152 align:middle line:84%
And I was work-- learning
about power and empowerment

00:32:00.152 --> 00:32:01.587 align:middle line:90%
through my own little experience

00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
of being a lawyer
and that drama.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.061 align:middle line:84%
So, all these lifetimes
come from the soul.

00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:12.531 align:middle line:84%
So really, what happens is
when I connect the person

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:84%
with another lifetime
they really rise

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:17.836 align:middle line:84%
up through the energy
of there higher self,

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:21.340 align:middle line:84%
through all the different
energy vibrations

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.808 align:middle line:90%
of the collective consciousness

00:32:22.808 --> 00:32:25.110 align:middle line:84%
in different collective
agreements,

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.113 align:middle line:84%
enrich the energy
of the oversoul.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:29.615 align:middle line:84%
And because through
the oversoul,

00:32:29.615 --> 00:32:32.051 align:middle line:84%
these lifetimes are
happening right now,

00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:34.086 align:middle line:90%
they're presently happening.

00:32:34.086 --> 00:32:37.823 align:middle line:84%
And from there on, they plunge
into the selected lifetime

00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:39.525 align:middle line:90%
and go down, does it make sense?

00:32:39.525 --> 00:32:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So, we go up and
then we go down.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.363 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
a person experiences

00:32:44.363 --> 00:32:46.899 align:middle line:84%
and not the lifetime
during a regression.

00:32:46.899 --> 00:32:48.967 align:middle line:90%
It's happening right now.

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:52.237 align:middle line:84%
They experience it
is I'm this person.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:90%
It's going on right now.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:00.079 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time the person
is also aware of me, myself.

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:03.682 align:middle line:84%
So, I am aware being Mira
and at the same time,

00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:06.785 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of being this other
person because to the soul,

00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:11.957 align:middle line:84%
these two things are its own
lifetimes to the oversoul

00:33:11.957 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're happening
simultaneously.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.263 align:middle line:84%
>> So, as we heal those,
the kind of go away

00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:21.934 align:middle line:84%
and those other lives are not
coexisting at the same time,

00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:24.269 align:middle line:84%
or they still are but
it's like seamless

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:26.238 align:middle line:90%
or what's going on with those?

00:33:26.238 --> 00:33:29.708 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I believe that
they're still coexisting.

00:33:29.708 --> 00:33:31.777 align:middle line:84%
So, what happen is
they still are there,

00:33:31.777 --> 00:33:34.980 align:middle line:84%
these lifetimes are
still developing.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.183 align:middle line:84%
It's for me after I have
experience the lifetime

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:39.818 align:middle line:84%
of the slave to say,
"You know what?

00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:42.454 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to repeat
this pattern again.

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm my own person.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.358 align:middle line:90%
I can do differently.

00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:49.394 align:middle line:84%
Let me see how I want
to do differently."

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:52.097 align:middle line:90%
And this happened so seamlessly

00:33:52.097 --> 00:33:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people are
not even consciously aware

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.968 align:middle line:90%
of it, right?

00:33:55.968 --> 00:33:58.237 align:middle line:90%
But the awareness is there.

00:33:58.237 --> 00:34:01.273 align:middle line:84%
The awareness of I don't
need to repeat this.

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:02.774 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to this.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:06.011 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
healing happens.

00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:09.948 align:middle line:84%
>> And one would lead to
another or to another, meaning,

00:34:09.948 --> 00:34:12.284 align:middle line:90%
until one is uncovered?

00:34:12.284 --> 00:34:14.887 align:middle line:84%
Really the others
cannot be uncovered.

00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Is there-- did you find

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.158 align:middle line:84%
that there's a process 'cause
you saw first the Nazis,

00:34:19.158 --> 00:34:21.459 align:middle line:84%
but then you went to
the slaves, and maybe,

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:90%
you have several others ones.

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:27.833 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, there
are many different themes

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:30.235 align:middle line:84%
that we're always
working on, right?

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:34.872 align:middle line:84%
So, in which every moment in our
life we connect to a lifetime,

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:39.678 align:middle line:84%
that's how we actually--
that's how these lessons

00:34:39.678 --> 00:34:42.247 align:middle line:84%
and these lifetimes
are given to us.

00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:47.251 align:middle line:84%
So, people are simultaneously
learning with there partners.

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.321 align:middle line:84%
So, they can experience
a lifetime,

00:34:49.321 --> 00:34:51.256 align:middle line:84%
which tells them what
is the relationship

00:34:51.256 --> 00:34:53.225 align:middle line:84%
with their husband,
with their children.

00:34:53.225 --> 00:34:55.093 align:middle line:84%
They can also experience
a lifetime,

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:56.862 align:middle line:84%
which connects to
a physical pain.

00:34:56.862 --> 00:35:01.567 align:middle line:84%
So, there's a bit this moment
of everything being presented

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:03.168 align:middle line:84%
to you that will
really guide you

00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:04.903 align:middle line:84%
and will give you
the best possible way

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:07.673 align:middle line:90%
of moving forward presently.

00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:10.008 align:middle line:84%
And later, when you
see another lifetime,

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:11.610 align:middle line:84%
when you experience
another lifetime

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.246 align:middle line:84%
that will be full whatever
you need to be healed

00:35:14.246 --> 00:35:16.081 align:middle line:90%
in that movement whatever issue.

00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:19.351 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, I, myself
do regressions all the time.

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:90%
I actually use my own recording.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.624 align:middle line:84%
My own guided regression because
it's such an easy and quick tool

00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:29.061 align:middle line:84%
to discover the answers
to see to be guided

00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:31.797 align:middle line:90%
to receive information.

00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And does reincarnation
fits in all these this then

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.903 align:middle line:84%
if all lifetimes are
happening at the same time.

00:35:37.903 --> 00:35:40.873 align:middle line:84%
How can we reincarnate
into other lives?

00:35:40.873 --> 00:35:44.376 align:middle line:84%
Do they still continue,
I mean in parallel, how?

00:35:44.376 --> 00:35:45.577 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:49.915 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to say, this
is a very, very novel way

00:35:49.915 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about this.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:56.421 align:middle line:84%
It's a very novel understanding
about all of these because up

00:35:56.421 --> 00:36:01.093 align:middle line:84%
until now, we have had this
understanding of reincarnation.

00:36:01.093 --> 00:36:04.663 align:middle line:84%
In other words, as I was
showing with my hands linearly

00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:07.933 align:middle line:84%
and I saw going from a lifetime
to a lifetime to a lifetime.

00:36:07.933 --> 00:36:10.068 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
valid approach.

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:12.704 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking to say
that this is incorrect

00:36:12.704 --> 00:36:15.440 align:middle line:84%
but this is also very
three dimensional way

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.009 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about it, right?

00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:20.245 align:middle line:90%
In a way of thinking that,

00:36:20.245 --> 00:36:23.215 align:middle line:84%
that way quantum mechanics
fits into this, right?

00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:27.452 align:middle line:84%
Quantum Mechanics was a way of
seeing the world that is coming

00:36:27.452 --> 00:36:30.789 align:middle line:84%
up now and connecting with
our developed consciousness

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:34.493 align:middle line:84%
when you think of Newtonian
mechanics and Newtonian physics,

00:36:34.493 --> 00:36:36.194 align:middle line:84%
you understand that
that was a way

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of seeing the world back
then because it was connected

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.999 align:middle line:84%
to our consciousness
and parallel

00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:45.237 align:middle line:84%
and matching our
consciousness back then.

00:36:45.237 --> 00:36:47.973 align:middle line:84%
So, it's very, very
similar in understanding

00:36:47.973 --> 00:36:51.543 align:middle line:84%
because when you bring in
the factor into all of these,

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:53.545 align:middle line:90%
the time is really simultaneous.

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:55.681 align:middle line:90%
Time is happening right now.

00:36:55.681 --> 00:37:00.452 align:middle line:84%
Then you understand that this is
really not so much reincarnation

00:37:00.452 --> 00:37:04.389 align:middle line:84%
as much as concurrent
lifetimes all developing

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:06.024 align:middle line:90%
and happening right now.

00:37:06.024 --> 00:37:09.328 align:middle line:84%
But to us, right here, it very
much feels like a past life

00:37:09.328 --> 00:37:14.132 align:middle line:84%
and a future life because time
is such a good way of creating

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:17.469 align:middle line:84%
and distinguishing and
differentiating and scheduling.

00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:22.774 align:middle line:84%
So, that's why I say to
people, it's actually both

00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:26.545 align:middle line:84%
at simultaneous time and
its past in linear time.

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:28.246 align:middle line:90%
You know, past and future time.

00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:33.318 align:middle line:84%
So, these lifetimes that
we call past lifetimes,

00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:37.789 align:middle line:84%
they're actually still going
on, which brings our discussion

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:41.226 align:middle line:84%
to whole new level of
understanding that I want

00:37:41.226 --> 00:37:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to share with you now because
these lifetimes are going

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:46.098 align:middle line:90%
on right now.

00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:48.633 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole lot of
possibilities that are waiting

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
to be born in this
lifetimes right now.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.873 align:middle line:84%
Because you see, one way to
think about is this lifetime

00:37:54.873 --> 00:37:56.641 align:middle line:90%
that I told you is this slave.

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.744 align:middle line:84%
You can say, "Well, it's
complete, it's over,

00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:01.079 align:middle line:90%
it's done," that's the story.

00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, that lifetime
is going on right now.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.387 align:middle line:84%
I have connected with
only one version of it

00:38:08.387 --> 00:38:10.889 align:middle line:84%
because when you start
thinking possibilities

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:14.292 align:middle line:84%
and alternative realities and
all these things I have come

00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:17.129 align:middle line:84%
to me through regressions,
this way of thinking.

00:38:17.129 --> 00:38:19.564 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you
the first time I heard

00:38:19.564 --> 00:38:21.500 align:middle line:90%
about this during a session.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.068 align:middle line:90%
I honestly stopped breathing.

00:38:23.068 --> 00:38:26.605 align:middle line:84%
I leaned back into the chair and
I was like how is this possible?

00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:29.107 align:middle line:90%
How could this even be?

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should tell you the
story so that it makes sense.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.185 align:middle line:84%
So this client was my very,
very first client outside

00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:42.754 align:middle line:84%
of my circle of family
and friends.

00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.991 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
when I reflect back on this.

00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:50.295 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking to myself, "Wow,
I did not feel ready for any

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:53.532 align:middle line:84%
of that and yet soars
God," I thought I was.

00:38:53.532 --> 00:38:56.701 align:middle line:84%
You know, just because this
was really a very new way

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.270 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about regression.

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:03.141 align:middle line:84%
So, this client saw
himself and we came

00:39:03.141 --> 00:39:06.278 align:middle line:90%
to the lifetime in around 1930.

00:39:06.278 --> 00:39:08.447 align:middle line:84%
And he was just about
to have a child.

00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:12.517 align:middle line:84%
He was giving me all these
details of where he lives,

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:17.022 align:middle line:84%
what year it is, what is his
name, what date he is born on,

00:39:17.022 --> 00:39:19.191 align:middle line:90%
all these incredible details.

00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And then, we went to the wedding

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.829 align:middle line:84%
of his daughter then
his wife died.

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:26.765 align:middle line:84%
And he lost his fortune
because he was a banker

00:39:26.765 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:90%
in New York City.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.504 align:middle line:84%
And he was really, he really,
his sound died in car accident.

00:39:32.504 --> 00:39:34.706 align:middle line:90%
His daughter became strange.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:37.175 align:middle line:84%
So, he was really in a
place of great loneliness

00:39:37.175 --> 00:39:40.412 align:middle line:90%
and he committed a suicide.

00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:45.484 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit rose from
the body and he continued

00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:48.920 align:middle line:84%
on to the other side and he
met with his spirit guide.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:53.358 align:middle line:84%
And he spirit guide greeted
him and said to him, "Well,

00:39:53.358 --> 00:39:54.593 align:middle line:90%
what do you want to do?"

00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:58.497 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to go back
and be born immediately

00:39:58.497 --> 00:40:01.099 align:middle line:90%
because that's what happens.

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:02.834 align:middle line:84%
People-- when people
commit suicide,

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.503 align:middle line:84%
they think that they
are putting an end to it

00:40:04.503 --> 00:40:06.037 align:middle line:90%
but it really is no end.

00:40:06.037 --> 00:40:09.541 align:middle line:84%
It's just another opportunity
to do it all over again not

00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:13.478 align:middle line:84%
because somebody is asking
you, not somebody like God

00:40:13.478 --> 00:40:16.448 align:middle line:84%
or somebody is saying to you,
"You got to accomplish this.

00:40:16.448 --> 00:40:19.384 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be committing
suicide because of,"

00:40:19.384 --> 00:40:22.621 align:middle line:84%
but it's really because you have
created a lesson for yourself.

00:40:22.621 --> 00:40:25.056 align:middle line:84%
The soul has created
a lesson for itself.

00:40:25.056 --> 00:40:28.426 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to learn and so,
it's going to keep on trying.

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.229 align:middle line:90%
So, he got born again.

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:34.633 align:middle line:84%
And-- so that these make
sense to you, he died,

00:40:34.633 --> 00:40:37.402 align:middle line:84%
he committed suicide
in the 1970s

00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:39.271 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still OK
with this, right?

00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:42.240 align:middle line:84%
He is saying that to me
and I'm still OK with it

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:47.679 align:middle line:84%
because the client as who he
is today as born in the 1980s.

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:48.847 align:middle line:90%
So, I'm still all right.

00:40:48.847 --> 00:40:51.750 align:middle line:84%
This is still working
and fitting.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, with his
second lifetime,

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:59.124 align:middle line:90%
he was actually born in 1950.

00:40:59.124 --> 00:41:02.193 align:middle line:84%
And like I said to you, I
held my breath, I leaned back

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:07.032 align:middle line:84%
into the chair and I didn't even
dare breathe because I was like,

00:41:07.032 --> 00:41:10.035 align:middle line:84%
"Wait, what if--
how could this be.

00:41:10.035 --> 00:41:12.037 align:middle line:84%
What is going on,"
and I honestly felt

00:41:12.037 --> 00:41:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that if I breathe somehow,
he's going to hear me breathing

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.709 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to
snap him out of this.

00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:20.211 align:middle line:84%
And he will realize,
this is not making sense.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.747 align:middle line:84%
And he-- I snapped him
out of the regression.

00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:27.452 align:middle line:84%
But he did and he just kept on
talking and we went through,

00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:30.555 align:middle line:84%
and in that lifetime, we went
through the entire lifetime,

00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:36.061 align:middle line:84%
he dies and that lifetime
sometimes in 2020,

00:41:36.061 --> 00:41:38.129 align:middle line:90%
which for us is in the future.

00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:40.165 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't happened yet.

00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:41.499 align:middle line:90%
He had no problem with that.

00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.969 align:middle line:84%
So, he just kept on
narrating lifetime

00:41:43.969 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime after lifetime.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:50.208 align:middle line:84%
So, every time he died,
he went to the other side,

00:41:50.208 --> 00:41:51.810 align:middle line:90%
spoke to his spirit guide.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.212 align:middle line:84%
They decided what
happens next and he went

00:41:54.212 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:90%
into another lifetime.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:01.853 align:middle line:84%
And all these lifetimes are
overlapping in same 120 years.

00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:03.888 align:middle line:90%
You know, in the same 120 years.

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:04.756 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a busy soul.

00:42:04.756 --> 00:42:05.790 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.725 align:middle line:90%
>> So, going [laughs] back.

00:42:06.725 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So, honestly I was
just blown away.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.299 align:middle line:84%
I was like, "This is not
what I've read in the books.

00:42:14.299 --> 00:42:15.367 align:middle line:90%
How could this be?

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:16.968 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?"

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:19.704 align:middle line:84%
So, when I connected him
with his higher self,

00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:23.108 align:middle line:84%
the higher self basically give
me the simplest answer you can

00:42:23.108 --> 00:42:24.309 align:middle line:90%
think of.

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, "Well, time
is really simultaneous

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:31.650 align:middle line:84%
but linear time works
for you guys."

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:32.717 align:middle line:90%
That's all what I was told.

00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:36.154 align:middle line:84%
You know, basically,
this is how it goes.

00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:39.124 align:middle line:90%
So later on, I actually realized

00:42:39.124 --> 00:42:43.228 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes souls
choose a very large span

00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:45.296 align:middle line:90%
of time the way we think of time

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.532 align:middle line:84%
to create these lessons
and learn.

00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:50.335 align:middle line:84%
So, these lifetimes
are going, you know,

00:42:50.335 --> 00:42:54.239 align:middle line:84%
as I said to you the time
of Jesus, in the 1600s,

00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:56.408 align:middle line:84%
in modern times,
in future times.

00:42:56.408 --> 00:42:59.611 align:middle line:84%
So when a person relives of
their lifetime, they will see

00:42:59.611 --> 00:43:04.649 align:middle line:84%
like a huge span and there will
be no apparent conflict in time.

00:43:04.649 --> 00:43:09.521 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, a specific chunk
of time like this 120 years,

00:43:09.521 --> 00:43:11.856 align:middle line:84%
a very productive
time for the soul.

00:43:11.856 --> 00:43:13.992 align:middle line:84%
You know, it feels
that it can learn all

00:43:13.992 --> 00:43:16.027 align:middle line:90%
of its lessons at the same time.

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:18.797 align:middle line:84%
So, in his case, he
chose these 120 years

00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:20.999 align:middle line:84%
to learn the lesson
of understanding.

00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:24.536 align:middle line:90%
That was his lesson.

00:43:24.536 --> 00:43:26.404 align:middle line:84%
And-- so that's how
I was exposed

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:29.374 align:middle line:84%
to this idea initially
and it blew my mind.

00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:33.344 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I said to you,
this was my first client

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:39.551 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking how
could this possibly be and

00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:41.953 align:middle line:84%
yet at the same time, I
couldn't doubt it because he was

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
so specific with all the
details he was giving me.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.494 align:middle line:84%
And later on I spoke with
Brian Weiss about this

00:43:49.494 --> 00:43:52.664 align:middle line:84%
and I was sharing with him all
this information and he said

00:43:52.664 --> 00:43:54.833 align:middle line:84%
to me, "Yeah, that's
how it always goes."

00:43:54.833 --> 00:43:57.736 align:middle line:84%
When you come to a
place of something new

00:43:57.736 --> 00:44:01.072 align:middle line:84%
so that you yourself
feel that this is right

00:44:01.072 --> 00:44:04.109 align:middle line:84%
and you have the confirmation
to move you on the spot.

00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:06.878 align:middle line:84%
He said to me that's how the
information always appears,

00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:11.182 align:middle line:84%
it's very clear without
the ability to doubt it.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:13.451 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me that it
was very similar for him in

00:44:13.451 --> 00:44:17.021 align:middle line:84%
and Catherine, his own first
client that allowed for him

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:19.791 align:middle line:84%
to step into this place
of this work for him.

00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:24.763 align:middle line:84%
So that was a very interesting
perspective to hear from him.

00:44:24.763 --> 00:44:27.699 align:middle line:84%
So, going back to what
I was saying to you

00:44:27.699 --> 00:44:32.070 align:middle line:84%
about these lifetimes, these
lifetimes are still going on.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.173 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we connect
with specific version of them

00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:36.708 align:middle line:90%
because seeing this version,

00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:38.977 align:middle line:84%
this lifetime is actually
what will allow us

00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:42.747 align:middle line:84%
to have the perspective and
the benefit of what we need.

00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:46.317 align:middle line:84%
And as I said to you, this work
is so divinely orchestrated

00:44:46.317 --> 00:44:49.154 align:middle line:84%
that I never know how
it's going to play out

00:44:49.154 --> 00:44:51.156 align:middle line:90%
or what is going to happen.

00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:54.459 align:middle line:84%
It's just you're soul always
knows how to guide you.

00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.761 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.063 align:middle line:84%
And because these
lifetimes are going on

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:01.466 align:middle line:84%
and because there is
always possibilities waiting

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:05.036 align:middle line:84%
to be orchestrated and
to come into being,

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:06.871 align:middle line:90%
that story is never over.

00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:09.541 align:middle line:84%
That lifetime is
never set in stone.

00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:14.979 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you have the
opportunity of stepping fully

00:45:14.979 --> 00:45:18.249 align:middle line:84%
into this work, Lilou, to
start doing interviews,

00:45:18.249 --> 00:45:20.318 align:middle line:84%
that was a major in
decision point, right?

00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:22.353 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I could
have gone this way

00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:23.788 align:middle line:90%
or I could have gone that way.

00:45:23.788 --> 00:45:26.791 align:middle line:84%
It was that kind of
a situation for you.

00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:28.827 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with me,
I could have chosen

00:45:28.827 --> 00:45:31.396 align:middle line:84%
to continue being a lawyer
or I could have chosen

00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:33.932 align:middle line:90%
to continue doing this work.

00:45:33.932 --> 00:45:36.467 align:middle line:84%
So, it's in these
moments of crossroads

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:41.339 align:middle line:84%
when our lives create
these different versions

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:44.409 align:middle line:84%
and it's really trough
regression that you connect

00:45:44.409 --> 00:45:47.111 align:middle line:90%
with what is most appropriate.

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:51.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Having interviewed Dolores
Cannon, she found herself

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.419 align:middle line:84%
with amazing messages
through the people

00:45:54.419 --> 00:45:56.855 align:middle line:84%
that she was doing
past life regression

00:45:56.855 --> 00:46:00.558 align:middle line:84%
with what did you
encounter, such communication

00:46:00.558 --> 00:46:04.128 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
beings, other people

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:08.233 align:middle line:84%
in other galaxies even, is
this part of this work as well?

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:11.002 align:middle line:84%
>> It definitely is
because as I said to you,

00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:14.539 align:middle line:84%
every session is
incredibly unique.

00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:17.675 align:middle line:84%
I have had people who have
experienced very regular

00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:21.846 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes just like the stories
we've been talking about today.

00:46:21.846 --> 00:46:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Other people have had very
beautiful symbolic stories,

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.552 align:middle line:90%
which tell them where--

00:46:27.552 --> 00:46:30.989 align:middle line:84%
which tell them how they
need to move forward.

00:46:30.989 --> 00:46:33.558 align:middle line:84%
Some people see themselves
as other life forms,

00:46:33.558 --> 00:46:41.032 align:middle line:84%
things like monkeys and
dinosaurs and wolves and flowers

00:46:41.032 --> 00:46:43.902 align:middle line:84%
because you know there is
consciousness there too.

00:46:43.902 --> 00:46:46.371 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
kind of consciousness

00:46:46.371 --> 00:46:50.174 align:middle line:84%
but it still consciousness
in learning and experience.

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:55.747 align:middle line:84%
And then people have experience
lifetimes where they go

00:46:55.747 --> 00:46:58.983 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensions, other
places, other planets,

00:46:58.983 --> 00:47:02.220 align:middle line:84%
spaceships like you were
saying, extraterrestrials.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:07.225 align:middle line:84%
They have met with their
angels, with their guides.

00:47:07.225 --> 00:47:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you a story about a man

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:19.137 align:middle line:84%
for whom his present life
time was his first incarnation

00:47:19.137 --> 00:47:20.805 align:middle line:90%
so that the story make sense.

00:47:20.805 --> 00:47:23.107 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you a
little bit about him.

00:47:23.107 --> 00:47:28.713 align:middle line:84%
So he came to me as-- he came
because he have prostate cancer

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:32.483 align:middle line:84%
and he wanted to understand
the prostate cancer.

00:47:32.483 --> 00:47:36.321 align:middle line:84%
And in his early
years, what has happened

00:47:36.321 --> 00:47:41.492 align:middle line:84%
with him is he discovered
alcohol.

00:47:41.492 --> 00:47:44.495 align:middle line:84%
So he discovered that
after taking a drink--

00:47:44.495 --> 00:47:48.533 align:middle line:84%
having a drink, he would have
this beautiful euphoric feeling,

00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:52.303 align:middle line:84%
you know, that feeling everybody
who has had a drink knows

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:84%
of expanding of really
growing in your awareness.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And-- but of course, he also
discovered that after the next

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.113 align:middle line:84%
and after the next, it really
goes downhill from there.

00:48:02.113 --> 00:48:03.748 align:middle line:90%
So eventually, he recognized

00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that drinking is
not a good thing.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:08.486 align:middle line:84%
So he set that aside
and he stopped drinking.

00:48:08.486 --> 00:48:11.422 align:middle line:84%
And then, he actually
discovered sex, right?

00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:17.128 align:middle line:84%
So he will have these
beautiful feelings of having sex

00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:21.532 align:middle line:84%
with his partner and that
beautiful feeling of opening,

00:48:21.532 --> 00:48:23.368 align:middle line:90%
have been feeling one with God

00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:27.338 align:middle line:84%
that just expensive
incredible feeling.

00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:31.609 align:middle line:84%
However, he got married and
he was so loyal to his wife

00:48:31.609 --> 00:48:34.045 align:middle line:90%
and he loved her so much.

00:48:34.045 --> 00:48:37.949 align:middle line:84%
And she felt that sex was not
a thing she was interested in.

00:48:37.949 --> 00:48:39.984 align:middle line:84%
She felt that it was one of
those things that, you know,

00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:42.153 align:middle line:90%
naughty boys are in to.

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:44.722 align:middle line:84%
And once they married, what's
the point of it, right?

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:51.629 align:middle line:84%
So, she basically [laughs]
put an end to that.

00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:54.832 align:middle line:84%
And he was still very
interested in it.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:58.503 align:middle line:84%
So there was a moment
of-- what do I do, right?

00:48:58.503 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So he couldn't cheat on her
because he was so loyal to her.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.376 align:middle line:90%
So, he actually killed his mojo.

00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:09.013 align:middle line:84%
He developed an erectile
disfunction.

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:13.117 align:middle line:84%
So, the next thing that happened
is because he really felt

00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:14.786 align:middle line:90%
like now, he's not a man, right?

00:49:14.786 --> 00:49:17.388 align:middle line:90%
He's not true to himself.

00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:20.391 align:middle line:84%
Now, he is not complete
within himself.

00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:24.128 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that happened
is he developed prostate cancer

00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.864 align:middle line:84%
because that's really what
the prostate represents.

00:49:26.864 --> 00:49:29.901 align:middle line:84%
It represents that
place of masculinity.

00:49:29.901 --> 00:49:34.739 align:middle line:84%
That place of being your own
true self, your own true energy.

00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:39.911 align:middle line:84%
And during our regression, other
than going to another lifetime,

00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:44.749 align:middle line:84%
he actually went into the energy
of what you and I called God,

00:49:44.749 --> 00:49:50.154 align:middle line:84%
that primal creative energy from
which everything originates.

00:49:51.089 --> 00:49:54.659 align:middle line:84%
And he experienced
that is nothing.

00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:58.563 align:middle line:84%
He experienced that is
benevolent loving nothing.

00:49:58.563 --> 00:50:00.131 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.300 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing for him.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:06.003 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't stop saying,
"Wow, this is incredible."

00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:09.807 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling, his experience
of merging with that energy.

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:13.878 align:middle line:84%
And really knowing what
it is like, that feeling

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:16.914 align:middle line:90%
of just really expansiveness.

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:22.053 align:middle line:84%
The feeling of incredible
beauty and power

00:50:22.053 --> 00:50:24.555 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
it was nothing.

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:28.926 align:middle line:84%
And only when asked him to
step out of it was he able

00:50:28.926 --> 00:50:34.899 align:middle line:84%
to give words and describe
it and the explanation

00:50:34.899 --> 00:50:38.603 align:middle line:84%
that he gave me is the
understanding that came from all

00:50:38.603 --> 00:50:41.305 align:middle line:90%
of this was that it's really

00:50:41.305 --> 00:50:44.542 align:middle line:84%
that God creative
energy is really nothing.

00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:49.447 align:middle line:84%
And for it to know itself
is creating this universe

00:50:49.447 --> 00:50:53.050 align:middle line:84%
as this reality, the
souls, these people

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.786 align:middle line:90%
out of itself to know itself.

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:57.221 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense?

00:50:57.221 --> 00:51:00.424 align:middle line:84%
Because when you step out of it,
that's when you know it's just

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:02.360 align:middle line:84%
like he-- this is what
he gave me as an example.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.829 align:middle line:84%
He said, when you are in a
building, you're not aware

00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:06.164 align:middle line:90%
of what the building is like.

00:51:06.164 --> 00:51:08.699 align:middle line:84%
You're simply in a building
but when you step out of it,

00:51:08.699 --> 00:51:11.536 align:middle line:84%
you look at the building
and you realized, oh wow,

00:51:11.536 --> 00:51:13.538 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
building looks like.

00:51:13.538 --> 00:51:16.741 align:middle line:84%
So, very much like the
way we create lifetimes.

00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:19.844 align:middle line:84%
And going back to his
story, the explanation

00:51:19.844 --> 00:51:25.783 align:middle line:84%
that he was given was he was
finding such incredible pleasure

00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:29.453 align:middle line:84%
through drinking and through
sex because it was his own way

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:32.223 align:middle line:84%
of connecting to God, you
know, it was that reminder

00:51:32.223 --> 00:51:33.558 align:middle line:90%
of where he came from.

00:51:33.558 --> 00:51:38.462 align:middle line:84%
The reminder of this is who
I truly I am and he was.

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:43.467 align:middle line:84%
By seeing this, he realized
that I can connect with God

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:46.404 align:middle line:84%
by simply meditating, by
simply putting myself again

00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:48.906 align:middle line:84%
in that state, in that
deep hypnotic state

00:51:48.906 --> 00:51:51.976 align:middle line:90%
in connecting with that energy.

00:51:51.976 --> 00:51:53.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, yeah.

00:51:53.711 --> 00:51:57.582 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I'm enjoying this
so much and it's so--

00:51:57.582 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing what we can learn

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.551 align:middle line:84%
through those past
life regression.

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:02.286 align:middle line:90%
I mean your life must be--

00:52:02.286 --> 00:52:05.223 align:middle line:84%
because I think my life is so
exciting interviewing people

00:52:05.223 --> 00:52:09.293 align:middle line:84%
but you got to get the real
juice from all those stories

00:52:09.293 --> 00:52:13.431 align:middle line:84%
and the history and
what's going on.

00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:16.901 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how exciting to be
like this soul interviewer.

00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:17.969 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:17.969 --> 00:52:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.574 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that you want
to leave us with so that we know

00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:26.777 align:middle line:90%
or realize or just get?

00:52:26.777 --> 00:52:28.746 align:middle line:90%
>> I think I would like to tie

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:31.015 align:middle line:84%
on what I just said
here at the end.

00:52:31.015 --> 00:52:34.785 align:middle line:84%
We all looking or for
that connection with soul,

00:52:34.785 --> 00:52:38.522 align:middle line:84%
its source, with our
higher self and we all do it

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.992 align:middle line:84%
through our own different
ways, eating, talking,

00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:44.528 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is our
addictions and passions are.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:47.999 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to encourage
people is to really just allow

00:52:47.999 --> 00:52:51.102 align:middle line:84%
for the simplest way of
connecting themselves to source.

00:52:51.102 --> 00:52:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Simply meditate.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.906 align:middle line:84%
Simply allow you're self to
do regressions, connect, know,

00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.742 align:middle line:90%
learn, and understand.

00:52:57.742 --> 00:52:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's try it.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.778 align:middle line:90%
Why not? I mean this is--

00:53:00.778 --> 00:53:03.381 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to have
a session with Mira.

00:53:03.381 --> 00:53:06.951 align:middle line:84%
Anyway big, big kisses my
delicious co-creators wherever

00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:08.552 align:middle line:84%
you are in the world
and stay tune

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.254 align:middle line:84%
because there's many
other videos.

00:53:10.254 --> 00:53:11.589 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
I'm going to pop next

00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:15.426 align:middle line:84%
but I'll sure put it
online as I'm traveling

00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:16.260 align:middle line:84%
around [Background
Music] the world.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.328 align:middle line:90%
Big, big kisses.

00:53:17.328 --> 00:53:18.929 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for this
delicious conversation.

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:20.364 align:middle line:90%
Thank you

00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.299 align:middle line:90%
>> Big, big kiss.

00:53:21.299 --> 00:53:22.933 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:23.934 align:middle line:90%
