00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.912 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:90%
Hello, my juicy co-creators.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.660 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful,
delicious, delightful

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.241 align:middle line:84%
interview is here for you,
because I'm with Panache Desai.

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Hello, Panache.
-Hi, Lilou.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.513 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here with you.

00:00:22.513 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It's great to be here
in beautiful Orlando,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.360 align:middle line:90%
sunny Florida, huh?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful weather
here, and people

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:84%
are just having the best time.
-Yes.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really excited
to speak with you,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
told me about you,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and your name is really
getting out there and getting

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.945 align:middle line:90%
bigger and bigger crowds.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was curious
as to why that is.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're bringing--
tell us about the essence

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
of your teaching, and then we'll
go a little bit more into it.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel it's precious
right now in these times

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
to be reminded of our
greatness and our light.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle of a
very profound shift in the way

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive ourselves.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:10%
And every single one
of you that's here

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:10%
is basically here because
you're at a point in your life

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:10%
where you're being
presented with a choice.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And the choice is to continue to
identify with your personality,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
with your limitations,
with your conditioning,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
with your thoughts,
with your body,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
or to transition into
identification with your soul

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, that part
of you that's infinite,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
your exponential potential,
as I like to call it.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, my work
has been to usher people

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:84%
into that reality, to
vibrationally support them.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, really, is a
vibrational science.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
mystics and yogis

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
figured out lots
of different ways

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to guide people into
that vibrational state.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.560 align:middle line:84%
More and more,
people are shifting

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
into that experiential place.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And so as spirituality
is shifting,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
people are realizing that it's
no longer about just reading

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
books and attending
seminars, that there needs

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to be a vibrational
dimension to the experience

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
for them to sustain
a transformation.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, my role is
just to be like a catalyst,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.590 align:middle line:84%
just to allow this greater
presence to flow through

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and to allow that to be
presented in the modern context

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and to be delivered in a way
the people can relate to it so

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that it's useful, so
that it's accessible,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
so that they can then see
themselves in the oneness

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
that they already
are and to live that.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just been this
extraordinary adventure for me.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.742 align:middle line:84%
And the more people
show up, the more

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
they're experiencing
this greater energy,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.950 align:middle line:84%
the more they're experiencing
the energy of themselves,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.649 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're realizing that
their life is not wrong.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They're realizing
that, actually,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
their life is a blessing.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And that greater realization
of the fact that their life is

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
a blessing is allowing them
to connect with a deeper

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:84%
part of themselves
that then touches

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:90%
the lives of those around them.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it's this ripple effect
that's bubbling out now,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that's creating this amazing
shift in people's lives,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:90%
that they're sustaining.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're living their greater
potential, their greater power.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So is that really-- 2012,
2013, are we talking here

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
also of a planet shift
that is simultaneously

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:90%
happening within us?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that both?

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.260 align:middle line:90%
It's happening on every level.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's a personal level,
it's a planetary level,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's a universal level.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And all three levels
are interrelated.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happening is now
we're coming back into harmony

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, which
is great, which means

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
we stop making ourselves wrong.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:90%
We stop judging ourselves.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:90%
We stop blaming ourselves.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We stop trying to fix, heal,
change, and improve ourselves.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that God was
not having a bad day when

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
we were made, that,
in fact, we were

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
made in absolute perfection.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we're shifting our
relationship with ourselves.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We're coming into
harmony with our design.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Like nothing in nature
questions its design.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
A rock doesn't sit there
wishing that it was something

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:90%
other than a rock, right?

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything in nature just
conforms to its design.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to once
again conform to our design

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:90%
just the way we are.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for people
to know that the divine loves

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.285 align:middle line:90%
them just the way they are.

00:03:55.285 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, Lilou, when I had
the experience of the divine

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that I had, there
was no judgment.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
There was no checklist.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
that I needed to do.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I was just fully
embraced for who I was.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And who I was was enough.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
I didn't need to be different.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to have
done anything else.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
No other version of myself
was required than the one

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:90%
that I was.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
greater shift now,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
is that acceptance, is that
presence, is that love of self,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that I am who I am.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have all these
wonderful parts to me.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And what society, and what
we even judge in spirituality

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and we judge in different
parts of life, what they deem

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to be negative or wrong is not.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It's actually just a blessing
waiting to be revealed.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's a blessing
in everything.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, what makes
a rainbow so beautiful

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.421 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
it is every color.

00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It's got red.
It's yellow.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:90%
It's got green.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of
one of those colors,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be as
beautiful as it is.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of your
anger, you wouldn't

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:90%
be as beautiful as you are.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of your
fear, you wouldn't

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%
be as beautiful as you are.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of your
story, you wouldn't be you.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
questioning our design,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it's time to start
embracing our design.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And what I found is that when
we stop fighting with ourselves,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we tap into that
planetary harmony

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:90%
and that universal harmony.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And then life gets
really good, because then

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that greater presence
begins to work through us.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is also
shifting in that same way

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:90%
as we're shifting?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Or it's helping us to shift?

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.575 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination
of them both.

00:05:26.575 --> 00:05:27.775 align:middle line:84%
You know, right
now, a lot of people

00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are finding it very
hard to sustain states

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:90%
of awareness and consciousness.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And it almost feels like you're
not standing on steady ground.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's because
the Earth is elevating

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:90%
a vibrational resonance, too.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And once this shift
is completed you're

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
going to feel like you finally
have some form of a stable base

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.602 align:middle line:90%
underneath you.

00:05:43.602 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And everything that you've
done up until this moment

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
will start to bear
fruit in a way

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even
imagine right now.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So two things are
happening, right?

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, people either feel
like they're in limbo,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
impatient, you know?

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
They're either in limbo, like,
oh, my God, like I'm stuck,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.361 align:middle line:84%
Or they're just like, oh,
quickly let's move, let's move,

00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:90%
move.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But either way, nothing
yet is occurring in the way

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that they know is possible.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we're waiting for
this vibrational platform.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Once we get this vibrational
platform underneath us,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.300 align:middle line:84%
things are going to start
happening so quickly.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
living into this time

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
that every great being spoke
of, where we would, in fact,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:90%
actually do more than they did.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this personal planetary
and universal alignment

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
is bringing us into the
fullness of who we are

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and the infinite expression
that we're here to be.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So the Buddha, the
Jesus, all these guys

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that were on the
planet are all-- more

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:90%
or less we can do the same?

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:90%
We can all do the same?

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We can all embody the divine
the same way that then they did?

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
greatest thing of all,

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that their lives were
lived as an example

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.140 align:middle line:90%
for what's possible for us.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
They came here to demonstrate
that in physical form.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.031 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they could have
just come as a blob of energy,

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.163 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why would they
have to take a body?

00:06:57.163 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't, what they?

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So they came in human
form to demonstrate what's

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
possible for us and to also
walk the human experience

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and to navigate
it consciously so

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:84%
that we can navigate it
consciously now in the way

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We're literally standing on
the shoulders of all of them,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and they are just clapping
us on and urging us

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
on to just once
and for all finally

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
own our potential,
to finally accept it

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and to live it in every
moment of our lives.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.386 align:middle line:84%
When you say we're capable
of greater than them,

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
what do you mean?

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean that everything
that's been demonstrated

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
will begin to be
demonstrated through us.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it is that people,
like people that are watching,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
you, everybody, we're just going
to embody spirit and presence

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:84%
so powerfully that just
walking down the street,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
everything that's
required or everything

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that everyone perceives as
missing will be delivered.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, spontaneous
alignments will begin to occur.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
appear to be miraculous.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden it's going to
appear that something amazing

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:90%
just occurred.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But for us, it's
going to be normal.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make the
miraculous normal and ordinary,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.080 align:middle line:84%
because everybody's
going to be doing it.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going to be
tapping into that potential

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:90%
and that power.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine right now
just walking down your street

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and just you being you and
allowing your greater spirit

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to emanate forth, just
spontaneously impacting

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:84%
everything and everyone,
restoring everybody

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
to their natural
state of harmony

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and their natural
state of balance,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
reminding them that they never
left oneness, that that's

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
their natural state,
that that beingness is

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:90%
their natural expression.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the power of each
and every single one of you.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We're very much living in an
age of personal empowerment,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's no longer a
teaching or following anybody.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
This is about every single
one of you owning you light

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and your contribution
and recognizing

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that that is actually you just
authentically being yourself.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing time.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like the dolphins,
when they swim,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
they really are just being.
-That's right.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:90%
They're just being themselves.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But their being
themselves impacts

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:90%
everything around them, right?

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, same thing with
the whales, right?

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with us.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:90%
We are tuning forks.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us
embodies vibrational resonance

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:90%
and frequency.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow for who we are
on the level of our humanity,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
our spirit naturally
emanates through that

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and impacts everything.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You're all doing it.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
You just made yourselves
wrong for doing it.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.950 align:middle line:84%
When you show up
because you embody love,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.845 align:middle line:84%
you bring everybody's
anger up or irritation

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
or sadness or frustration.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they judge you or they
make it about you so that they

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
don't have to really
receive the invitation

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:90%
that you're offering them.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the invitation
that you're offering

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:90%
them is back into love.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The possibility that
you're offering them

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:90%
is back into themselves.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So what they have to do is
judge you, make you wrong,

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
make it about you, try and
change you, fix, heal, and

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:90%
improve you, because it's you.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
That way, it continually
pushes themselves away

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.130 align:middle line:90%
from themselves.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So just don't take
it personally, folks.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Just know that something
greater is unfolding through you

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and that that something
greater is bringing up

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
everything and
everyone around you,

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:90%
that it's never been about you.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Is there some daily
practice or some things to do

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to remind ourselves of this?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the greatest
things is to not take it

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.631 align:middle line:84%
personally, is to just
recognize that your presence is

00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
your presence.
What you know, you know for you.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And that everyone, regardless
of what they're saying,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
is only ever talking
about themselves.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they're in
their own reality.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone
says something

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
to you like, oh, my God,
maybe you should change this,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you need
to improve this,

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you need to
fix this, or maybe you

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
need to do something
differently,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
they're talking
about themselves.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They're commenting on their
own state of consciousness

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and awareness out loud.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's going on.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And so don't personalize things.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you do personalize
something, just embrace it.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Just feel what there is to feel.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're in
an age now where

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle line:84%
it's important to become
fluid and to allow

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:90%
things to flow through us.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Your sadness is not wrong.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Your anger is not wrong.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Your fear is not wrong.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And being human is the blessing.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's the acceptance
of all of that,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:84%
it's the acceptance
of everything

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
conditioned to believe

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is wrong that
allows you to access

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:90%
the freedom that you are.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
spaciousness is.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when someone says
something about you,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:90%
just agree with them.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
When somebody disagrees
with you, agree with them.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Don't offer any resistance,
because it's not true.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you just embrace
it no matter what it is,

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.850 align:middle line:90%
it just washes through you.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
It's only when you resist it,
you take a defensive posture,

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
that all of sudden then
there's an energy around it.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:90%
There's a resonance around it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a frequency around it.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes yours.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Just for a moment, just close
your eyes all over the world.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And just for a moment,
imagine if you had never,

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:90%
ever personalized anything.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Would there be an issue?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:84%
If you had created no
meaning or significance

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
around any of
life's events, would

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:90%
there be anything to resolve?

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Would there be anything to heal?

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Would there be
anything to prove?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Would there be anything to make
up for or feel guilty about?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:90%
There wouldn't.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened is that
we've personalized things.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
We've made things about us.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And we've allowed that to occur.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So anywhere where we've
allowed that to occur,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
we just let it wash
through you right now.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
All around the world,
just take some breaths.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Just let it wash
through your system.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not about you.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not about you.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And when it shows up
again or when it's there,

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:90%
are some things to do again?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
like there are some

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that are really solidly, really
accurate and want to stay.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and they're the
ones that we really mean.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that we
really buy into, right?

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's a label that
someone puts on you

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and you really
agree with, right?

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, you'll never be happy.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, my, God,
I'll never be happy.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.731 align:middle line:84%
And then you hold
onto it, right?

00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:55.563 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what happens?

00:12:55.563 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:90%
You'll never be happy.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the thought.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing
that needs to evolve, too.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people are
involved in this conversation

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
that thoughts create reality.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would
be like God giving

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
every single human being
like a stick of dynamite--

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
not a good idea.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of what we
think on a daily basis

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
is absolute nonsense.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if all of that
immediately became reality.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:90%
We'd be in trouble, wouldn't we?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just imagine right
now if we both thought,

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was dead.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:90%
We'd die, wouldn't we?

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Thank God it doesn't
happen that way, right?

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So people are missing
the deeper conversation.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The deeper conversation is
it's our vibrational resonance

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
and frequency that's impacting
our reality and our experience.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not our thoughts.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts are, in
fact, a manifestation

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of those unresolved
emotional feelings

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
that we have inside of us.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we have sadness and
fear and guilt inside of us,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.941 align:middle line:84%
then we have thoughts and
feelings of unworthiness,

00:13:46.941 --> 00:13:47.640 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the thought
that creates the experience.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
unresolved energetic content

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
or density that's creating
the belief systems

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%
or holding them in place.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so any and all
places where you've

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:84%
believed anything about you,
let's just take some breaths.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's just let that
wash through you.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Just relax and just let
that wash through you,

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and just get in touch
with those energies,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.630 align:middle line:90%
the sadness, the fear.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Get in touch with it.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Allow life and
consciousness to do its job.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Allow life and
consciousness to do its job.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And its job is to bring you
into the fullness of yourself.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:90%
That is its sole purpose.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:90%
That's its sole purpose.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Feel your feelings.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Be present for what's
occurring in each moment.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Experience it through
to completion.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.641 align:middle line:84%
And when it arises
again, it's not wrong.

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you didn't do
it properly the first time.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Eventually you'll get to a
point where feeling becomes

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
blissful-- feeling
becomes blissful--

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
that it's not wrong to
feel, that we shouldn't

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
be feeling certain things.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:90%
That's conditioning.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
That's conforming to
society's conversation

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.830 align:middle line:90%
around certain emotions.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.737 align:middle line:84%
Anger and sadness is
socially unacceptable.

00:14:56.737 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:90%
So then what do we do?

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:90%
We stuff them.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.100 align:middle line:90%
They create density.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Because then we have all these
stories that them in place.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.127 align:middle line:84%
They begin to cause dissonance
in our vibrational system.

00:15:08.127 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden we're
an infinite being

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:90%
pretending that we're not.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.840 align:middle line:90%
We've bought into limitation.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And our life begins
to reflect that.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if none
of that is true?

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
How about you're an
infinite being, and even

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of all
of those experiences,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:84%
you're still an infinite
being, that it doesn't

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
change anything, that
infinity, by definition,

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:90%
is all inclusive?

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Oneness is all inclusive.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's time for an inclusive
way of being with ourselves--

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves-- those
parts that you like

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and those parts that you
perceive that you don't like.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
They're all valid.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
They're all relevant.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
They're all leading
you into more.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Receive that all
around the world.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
All of you, just
take some breaths.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that in every cell.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Everything is working for you.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything is unfolding
for your benefit.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
you've been told

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
is wrong about you
is just a blessing

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be realized.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the authentic
part being authentic.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.116 align:middle line:90%
You speak quite a lot about it.

00:16:05.116 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So being authentic is when
you're angry, just be angry.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to be angry.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
When you're sad, just be sad.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you don't
have to, you know,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.754 align:middle line:84%
all of sudden create additional
meaning around it, right?

00:16:17.754 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people are sad, and
it's like, oh, my God,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the
sadness of the planet,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and my third chakra is
not spinning properly.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I need to do something.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:90%
No, you're just sad.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:90%
It's normal to be sad.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what state
of consciousness you live in.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be sad.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
experience your anger.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're just not going to
have a problem with it anymore.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the difference.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:90%
But it can quickly wash away.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:90%
It can be quickly transmuted.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
What is it linked to?

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Why sometimes it's washed
away for some people

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:90%
faster than others?

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:84%
It's washed away because
we're in alignment with it.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:90%
We're not resisting it.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:90%
We're not rejecting it.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to
do something with it.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
We're just literally
being with it.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:90%
We're being spacious with it.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like if you
actually get triggered,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and you get angry and you
just takes some breaths

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.331 align:middle line:84%
and just allow that energy
to wash through you,

00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:90%
it's incredible.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's literally
like the closest thing

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll have to feeling a volcano
going off inside of your body.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Really, like literally
the charge goes off.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:90%
The energy begins to arise.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you just
allow it to arise

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and you just breathe through
it, it just washes through you.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's done.
And then it's done.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:90%
But most people don't do that.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people need to
assign a meaning to it.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's because you did
something that I'm angry.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.030 align:middle line:90%
No, you're just angry.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:90%
You're just experiencing anger.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Anger is an energy.
It's OK.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It just wants to be
experienced, you see?

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's the difference.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Sadness is a great emotion.
I love it.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
We can only cry
in this dimension.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Salty water running down
both of your cheeks--

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:90%
you make up the rest, right?

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
You're literally making it up.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:90%
But that's all that's happening.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Something occurs
in your reality,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
and salty water starts dripping
down both sides of your face.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's all crying
really is, you see?

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
But we make it significant.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.750 align:middle line:90%
We make it mean something.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We make it mean that in
some way, we're less than

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
or we're not quite
getting it, like we

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
should be joyful all the time.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
But that's just so
one-dimensional.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
We're here to feel
it all authentically.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%
When you're sad, be sad.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Be in the sadness.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.954 align:middle line:90%
Feel that.

00:18:15.954 --> 00:18:16.754 align:middle line:90%
Let it wash through you.

00:18:16.754 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:90%
When you're angry, be angry.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Let it wash through you.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So another way of
describing authenticity

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
is that you're in coherence.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
You're in alignment
with what is.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You're in alignment
with what is.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:90%
You're not resisting.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not changing.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.500 align:middle line:84%
You're just in
alignment with what is.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%
You're surrendering to what is.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Is there some
other misconceptions

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:84%
that you here and
that kind of makes

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:90%
you tick off a little bit?

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's lots
of misconceptions.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Like there's negative
energy that we

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:90%
have to cleanse and clear.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:90%
That's all the old paradigm.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.077 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as negative energy.

00:18:50.077 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as
positive energy, either.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy, right?

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't do that
with water, do we?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Water is positive, and
water is negative-- no.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's human perception that's
creating the interpretation

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%
of the experience, right?

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So if an energy plays
out in your life in a way

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
that you like on the
level of your personality,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll say that's good
energy or good karma, right?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was good karma, right?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:84%
If an energy plays out
in your life in a way

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that you don't like on the
level of your personality,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
you'll say that was negative
energy or bad karma.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that energy
that you don't like

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is working in your
favor, you don't even

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
realize it, because
you're saying,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:90%
oh, my God, that's negative.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But really, ultimately, there's
no such thing as polarity.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It's only ever our mind
that's creating the polarity

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:90%
or keeping the duality in place.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And so these conversations
of cleansing and clearing

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:90%
imply that something's wrong.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Even when we see some-- we
see some dark forces sometimes,

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
too, I mean in the governments
or in the 9/11 or some tragedy,

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean all that.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.810 align:middle line:84%
How can we not judge
that negatively

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
or even be scared of it?

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me ask you this.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Judging it and then being
in the resistance of it

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:90%
keeps it in place.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It keeps it locked in place.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.500 align:middle line:84%
That which we judge,
we lock in place.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Because we've got some point of
view around it in our minds--

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.519 align:middle line:90%
dark forces.

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:13.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just look
at how much power

00:20:13.685 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:90%
we're giving it all, right?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But as infinite beings,
aren't we all of it?

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:90%
We're all of it, aren't we?

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we can just
be all of it, and we

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.221 align:middle line:84%
can actually just resolve all
these energies inside of us,

00:20:24.221 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:90%
we're free.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So another way of saying it is
that planetary events are just

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
illustrating to us
personally where we're still

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:90%
unresolved with ourselves.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Something that's
happening in the world

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:84%
is occurring so that we can
feel the energies inside of us

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that we need to feel
around that event.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Like just imagine if
we all woke up tomorrow

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:90%
loving and accepting ourselves.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
What would happen, right?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:90%
But where does that begin?

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:90%
That begins inside of us.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And so when something happens
in the world, the place to look

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
is inside of you.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And the place to look
is, oh, my God, what is

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:90%
this bringing up inside of me?

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And then to get present to
it and to experience it,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
and in the experiencing
of it, then, you

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:90%
can begin to feel it, right?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people have a
lot of anger around war.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize
is that that anger around war

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:84%
is keeping the paradigm
of war in place.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
watching the news,

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of being victimized
by what you're seeing,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:84%
use it as a tool to
expand your consciousness

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and to expand your
vibrational resonance by just

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
simply being with what
you're seeing and breathing,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing your body, and
just allowing every energy

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
inside of you around what's
occurring in front of you

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:90%
to just wash through you system.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you get to a place
of harmony around it.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And then all of these
paradigms of human experience--

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:84%
war, suffering, all these
things-- begin to fall away.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the more we
love and accept ourselves,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the more we are creating
a platform for this planet

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:90%
to love and accept itself.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
When we resist things, we're
ultimately just keeping all

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:90%
those things locked in place.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Or we judge them, or we label
them dark forces, negative.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We're locking things in place
without even realizing--

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.685 align:middle line:90%
without even realizing.

00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But action is also
important, right?

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Or it's just a matter
of being and sitting

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:90%
there in the fetus pose?

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Action is really
important, but only once

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.690 align:middle line:84%
you've come to a place of
clarity within yourself.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
people right now trying

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:84%
to resolve themselves
outside of themselves.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So once you've come
to a place of clarity

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
around it inside of
yourself, then yeah,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
then of course action is great.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But action then is, don't
sit there on your couch

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
sending love and
light to somewhere.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.417 align:middle line:90%
Like that's a great action.

00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But how about you
just get on a plane

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and go there and feed
people tangibly, right?

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Like that's an action.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:90%
That's love in action.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
That's actually taking action
in the place where it's

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:84%
required instead
of sitting at home

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
and just sending love and light.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:90%
That's great, but you know what?

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if instead
of sending love and light

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
to a place, if everyone who
was really impacted by that

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
actually got on a plane
and went to that place,

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
how much more powerful
would that be, right?

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Like if we actually
organized as a community,

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
and instead of just sitting
around where we are,

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:90%
we go there, we feed people.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
We're actually there with
people, holding space for them

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:90%
and being with them, right?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
to do is to examine

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:90%
what it's bringing up in you.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.227 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:23:25.227 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
thing is, once you've

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:90%
gotten that, then go there.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Then go there and do something
from that place of neutrality

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It brings up the money
conversation, of course,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to money.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.740 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
How can I go there and
fly there to this place?

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, that's coming
from somebody who's flown

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to so many different places.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
-But I hear it often.
-Right.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's a conversation that
we've created in our own minds

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.320 align:middle line:90%
that there's not enough.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So any and all places where
we've bought into fear, lack,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and scarcity is the truth.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Like let's just
dissolve all of that.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Just take some breaths.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Any and all places where you've
bought into that there's not

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:84%
enough, that you're actually
going against the oneness

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that you are and the
abundance that you are, let's

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
just lovingly
integrate all of that.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:84%
All around the
world, just breathe.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And all places inside of you
where you have made fear, lack,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and scarcity more real than the
truth of your abundant nature,

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:90%
take some breaths.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
invite all that energy

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:90%
to wash through you.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
actually bring it

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:84%
into the light of your
awareness and your presence,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that you see it for the false
information that it really is,

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not true.
It's not true.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
enough for everybody.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
There always has
been, always has been.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of you knows that.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So any and all places where
you've bought into fear, lack,

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and scarcity to
keep you limited,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to keep your story in place, to
give you living in victimhood,

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.041 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from fully shining
your light fully and brightly.

00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Take some breaths.
Just receive that.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Just let all of that come up.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Just allow all of that
to wash through you.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And just allow the truth
of your luminous nature

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
to just be revealed.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Allow the truth of your
luminous nature to be revealed.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The other
misconceptions that you

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
hear of-- so you just
talked about the negative,

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
the positive, about money.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
What other kind of
seemingly truths

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
we're born into that
could be dissolved?

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biggest misconception
is that we're not enlightened,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
that enlightenment is an
event that we have to attain.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You as a soul came
into your body.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.611 align:middle line:84%
You're enlightened.
That's it.

00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You're done, right?
Your soul came in to form.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:90%
You're enlightened.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's
enlightened, by the way.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not just people
on a spiritual path.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's enlightened.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.270 align:middle line:84%
They have the light of
the divine within them.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:90%
That's enlightenment.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's not something--
-It doesn't go away?

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
No, never.
No, never.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Lifelong eternal membership
to the Enlightenment Club,

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Lilou-- no matter what
you do, your membership

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
will never be revoked, right?

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So everyone just take a breath
and just chill out right now.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
All of you that are seeking
and searching enlightenment,

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:90%
just stop.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Just slow down.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And just be with this truth.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Your soul came into your body.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.440 align:middle line:90%
You're enlightened.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
The light of the divine
manifested in physical form.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.790 align:middle line:90%
You're enlightened.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.101 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:25.101 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, how you
experience that truth

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
is by lovingly accepting the
physicality, the mental form,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:90%
the emotional aspects.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
That's when you experience
the luminous nature of life.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It's in those moments where you
begin to see through reality.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:84%
You see through the illusion
of solidity that exists.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You see the luminous
nature of things.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see
when I see people.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I just you see their
luminous essence.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And so enlightenment
is not a destination.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not an attainment.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
You're already there.
Just take a breath.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
You're already enlightened--
already enlightened.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're experiencing
it to the degree

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to which you're allowing
yourself to experience it.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You're experiencing to
the degree to which--

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.800 align:middle line:84%
so will you all allow
yourselves to fully

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.070 align:middle line:90%
experience your enlightenment?

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Just take some breaths.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.825 align:middle line:84%
Just allow yourselves to fully
experience the enlightenment

00:27:19.825 --> 00:27:20.895 align:middle line:90%
that you already are.

00:27:20.895 --> 00:27:23.605 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.605 --> 00:27:27.576 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH] Cool.

00:27:27.576 --> 00:27:29.850 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:90%
That just shifted everything.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Some other ones that you
hear from even other teachers

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:84%
or some things that you've
read or you just hear

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and you're like, no.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean,
the biggest one is

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:84%
that you have to go through
somebody to get to yourself.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So in India, the
primal essence of yoga,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
or Indian philosophy, which
actually-- so Hinduism

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:90%
is not a religion.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the first misconception.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
The translation-- actually,
the word is "sanatan dharma."

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And "sanatan dharma" is
actually "eternal truth."

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And eternal truth is
not a destination.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
you have to attain.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Eternal truth is
all encompassing.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not a religion.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient yogis and mystics
uncovered a vibrational science

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're vibrational
beings, that at the root,

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
core essence of reality,
there's this luminous quality.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And some also describe
this sound of Om.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a luminous quality
in a sound vibration, Om, that

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.290 align:middle line:90%
is the essence of all creation.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:90%
That's their belief.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually an
experience that people

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:90%
have when they transition.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
They have near
death experiences.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They experience their
luminous quality,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and they experience
that sound vibration.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So this greater essence, the
foundational principle of it

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.390 align:middle line:84%
is that god, guru, and self
are already one, that, in fact,

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:90%
there is no separation.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:84%
That truth was also articulated
by Jesus when he said,

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I and my father are one.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation
in that, right?

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And Lord Buddha realized it
when he realized that it wasn't

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:84%
through the material
world, and it wasn't

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:90%
through spiritual austerity.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the middle path.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And so this same eternal truth
pervades every single path

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:90%
in every single tradition.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:84%
But my beloved friends, you are
that eternal truth right now.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.530 align:middle line:90%
You're living it.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:84%
You're living that
eternal truth.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about going
through anybody anymore.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It's about understanding
that you yourself

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
already know everything
that you need

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.210 align:middle line:90%
to know for you in your life.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I first
started doing programs,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:90%
sometimes nobody would show up.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So I would just do the
whole program for myself.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I realized that I
was the only one who needed

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:90%
to hear what I was saying.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I started listening
to myself, my life got better.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't listen to ourselves.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.450 align:middle line:84%
We've projected our
light, love, and power

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:90%
onto external authorities.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And the very second you put
yourself outside of yourself,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:90%
you're lost.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:90%
You're lost.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no completion
that's possible-- none.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so any and all places where
you've projected you light,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
love, and power
onto someone else,

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
or you actually
believe in your mind

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.390 align:middle line:84%
that somebody has something
that you don't already have,

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:84%
are you willing to just
fully allow all of that

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.190 align:middle line:90%
to just wash through you?

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Take some breaths.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Just let all of that
wash through you.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.241 align:middle line:84%
In oneness, there's
no hierarchy.

00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no guru.
There's no disciple.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no teaching.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:90%
There's no healer.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no one healed.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is just an
emanation of spirit,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and spirit in each moment
is whole and complete,

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:84%
abiding in the
fullness of itself.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So all around the world, are
you willing to just abide

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.340 align:middle line:90%
in the fullness of yourself?

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Just take some breaths.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Just receive that.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.948 align:middle line:90%
Receive that.

00:30:43.948 --> 00:30:46.860 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH] Cool.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's getting good.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.810 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
The oneness-- my goodness,
everybody speaks about that.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting
it, and sometimes

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:90%
we're back into the separation.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But more and more, we can
feel that oneness, allowing

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.090 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to feel the oneness.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And oneness is always here.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:90%
Oneness is our natural state.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
It's always here.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
It's our unnatural state.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It's when we allow ourselves
to be our natural state--

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.090 align:middle line:84%
when we allow ourselves to
be our natural state, that's

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:90%
oneness.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So even in those moments
where you feel like you're not

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.640 align:middle line:90%
experiencing oneness, you are.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just waiting for you
to dive a little deeper,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:84%
just waiting for you to
take three deep breaths

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and just go a little
deeper, to tap into it.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Oneness and the
divine and beingness

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:90%
is that undercurrent of life.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.560 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just we don't stop
and slow down and go there.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's always there.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:90%
It's always inside of you.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.240 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not an attainment.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing that you have
to do something to have.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's not someone that's
going to bestow it upon you.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:90%
That's another illusion.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's something that ultimately
you finally give yourself

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
permission to be and have.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's just anchor
everybody in oneness, Lilou.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:90%
So just take some deep breaths.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.350 align:middle line:90%
[DEEP BREATH] Good.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.745 align:middle line:84%
And are you also
willing to acknowledge

00:32:12.745 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
that all the seeking
and searching

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.940 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
doing, all along you've

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:90%
just been looking for yourself?

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.046 align:middle line:90%
Take some breaths.

00:32:20.046 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:84%
All this seeking and searching
that everyone's doing

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
is no different than a
dog chasing its own tail

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.620 align:middle line:84%
until eventually it bites
its own tail and then yelps.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
realized that it was

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.160 align:middle line:90%
just chasing a part of itself.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.570 align:middle line:84%
My beloved friends,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.240 align:middle line:84%
sacred place there is upon this
Earth, every single one of you.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Right inside?

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.290 align:middle line:84%
That's right, right
inside, will along.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:90%
All along.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that
it's in the heart.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's in the heart.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:90%
It's wherever you want it to be.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's your reality.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So whatever it is that
you would like it to be,

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:90%
just receive that.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Just provide yourself in this
moment whatever it is that you

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:84%
need to fully own your power and
your light and your luminosity.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And let's end the game of
projection and reflection.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's just dissolve
that whole paradigm.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the foundation, again,
is god, guru, and self are one.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:90%
God, guru, and self are one.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation--
no separation.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is, everyone's

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.660 align:middle line:84%
trying to end separation, but
separation is not the enemy.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Planet Earth is like Las Vegas.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
dimension where you

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.700 align:middle line:84%
can eat food, where I can see
the illusion of someone else,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Like there's another body, and
it's very convincing that it's

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.580 align:middle line:90%
someone other than me.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's just me
in another form.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's what separation
allows us to have.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Like you can actually
see something

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and have the illusion of it
being something other than you.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you can articulate
to that other thing

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that you perceive to be
separate, I love you.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Or you can embrace it.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You can hug it, right?

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:90%
You can eat things here.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.175 align:middle line:90%
You can smell things here.

00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:90%
You can taste things here.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Separation is the blessing.

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not the enemy.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.659 align:middle line:84%
It's what allows us to
have this experience

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves in other
forms, of who we are

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:90%
made manifest in other forms.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:90%
So embrace the separation.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.969 align:middle line:90%
Embrace the separation.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Stop trying to end it.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Just embrace it.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.989 align:middle line:90%
It's a blessing.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:25.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's just embrace that.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Take some breaths.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Embrace the separation.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Separation is not the enemy.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Embracing, release it, loving--
the mental goes back into it.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So embracing it just creates
space for the experiencing

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:90%
and feeling of it.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Embracing it.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:45.179 align:middle line:84%
So the languaging
is changing, too.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:48.641 align:middle line:84%
Like embracing is more of that
divine feminine languaging.

00:34:48.641 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Embracing.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you're a
child and you fall over

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and you scrape your knee, all
you want is to be embraced.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment when you're
embraced-- when you observe

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.234 align:middle line:84%
children in the
playground, they'll cry,

00:35:01.234 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
but the very second they're
embraced and they're help

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and they feel OK, they'll
go and play again.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But here's what happens when
something isn't embraced.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Same child falls over, scrapes
his knee, and the mother says,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't raise you to be soft.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Why are you crying?

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.660 align:middle line:90%
What are you crying for?

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.677 align:middle line:90%
Don't cry.

00:35:15.677 --> 00:35:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I raised you to be tough.

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:90%
I raised you to be strong.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Why are you crying?

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:90%
What happens to that child?

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.670 align:middle line:84%
The child's like, oh, my
God, and it keeps crying

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and it freaks out and it shuts
down that way of being, right?

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we're
doing to ourselves.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:84%
In any given moment,
we're that mother.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're either loving
and embracing of ourselves,

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:90%
or we're the other version.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling this?

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You've been meditating for
20 minutes for 20 years

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:90%
now every morning.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Why are you still feeling
all of these things?

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:44.049 align:middle line:84%
You've been cleansed.
You've been cleared.

00:35:44.049 --> 00:35:45.640 align:middle line:90%
You've been smudged.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You've gone everywhere
you're supposed to go.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.440 align:middle line:84%
You've gone to
every sacred site.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.880 align:middle line:90%
You've received activation.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.730 align:middle line:84%
You have every technique
and modality that you

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:90%
could ever possibly have.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Why are you still feeling this?

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Your chakras are
spinning properly, right?

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:84%
There's that version, or
there's just an embracing.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Which one feels better?

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.360 align:middle line:90%
The embracing.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And how do you see
relationship, people getting

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
together in couple
and deciding to--

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
is there a particular
mirroring effect there more

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:16.250 align:middle line:84%
than other relationship
or friendship or any type

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.380 align:middle line:90%
of other relationship?

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because love,
loving relationships,

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.364 align:middle line:84%
bring everything up in you that
you've created to not be love.

00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So everything that you've
judged about yourself

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.810 align:middle line:90%
is going to come up.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
All your insecurities
are going to come up.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you're
afraid of is going to arise.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to arise in you.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.120 align:middle line:84%
There's this wonderful
spiritual teacher

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:84%
from India who said, if you
want to do spiritual practice,

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.990 align:middle line:90%
get married.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Because then you're
with a mirror 24/7

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:90%
that you can't escape, right?

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
You with yourself all
the time in another body.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
like love to bring

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:90%
everything up in everybody.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:90%
So relationships are great.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like being in
a workshop 24/7.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like trigger,
embrace, trigger, embrace,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.120 align:middle line:90%
trigger, embrace, right?

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And you get to expand.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:90%
That's what love does.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Love expands you.

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Love expands you.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.210 align:middle line:90%
And so relationships are great.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:06.660 align:middle line:84%
They're a great catalyst for
ourselves-- for ourselves.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, you have to know
and understand that you're only

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:12.060 align:middle line:84%
ever in relationship
with yourself,

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.460 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately
that other person

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.640 align:middle line:84%
is playing the role that you've
asked them to play for you.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
can remember that,

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.750 align:middle line:84%
you'll consciously be engaged
in relationship-- consciously.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.260 align:middle line:84%
But you've asked that person to
show up at that point in time

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and space to push
all of your buttons,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to show you everything
that you have

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:90%
to embrace within yourself.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
can remember that,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.150 align:middle line:84%
it's the sweetest
experience there is.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because then, it's
not about them.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not about them.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Women that get abused, or
there's so many different type

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:50.860 align:middle line:84%
of cases, some relationship that
are no longer needed, really,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.960 align:middle line:84%
too, because how do you
know whether it's coming

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.490 align:middle line:90%
from you, the other person?

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you
get to a point where

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:90%
you just-- you're done, right?

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Some people get married.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.370 align:middle line:84%
From day one, they know they
married the wrong person.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, not the wrong
person, but they

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.560 align:middle line:84%
knew on a vibrational level
that it wasn't going to last.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:84%
20 years later, they're
still in that situation.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they're still
in that situation

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:84%
because they still haven't
vibrationally gleaned what

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.840 align:middle line:84%
there is to glean
from that experience.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:84%
The very second you
come into that space,

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
you'll pack your
bags, you'll leave,

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and won't even look back.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with work situations.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with everything, right?

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And abuse and all those things
occur in our reality because

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:37.000 align:middle line:84%
of the guilt and the shame
that we feel and all of that

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.090 align:middle line:90%
self-hatred that we feel.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's OK for someone
to act that way towards us,

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that's why this
path of acceptance and loving

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.780 align:middle line:84%
yourself is the most
revolutionary act that you

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:90%
can commit in your lifetime.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.096 align:middle line:84%
Because loving yourself
means that you're

00:38:56.096 --> 00:38:57.944 align:middle line:90%
not a doormat anymore.

00:38:57.944 --> 00:38:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, the
more you love yourself,

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:90%
the less you tolerate.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The more you value
yourself, the more

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:84%
you're living in the
experience of your truth.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine like
if everyone fully

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:90%
loved and accepted themselves.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Would we have war?

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Would we have abuse?

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Would we have famine?

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Would we have suffering anymore?

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.304 align:middle line:84%
If everyone woke up tomorrow,
would there be any conflict,

00:39:18.304 --> 00:39:19.170 align:middle line:90%
just loving and accepting?

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if every man and
woman woke up tomorrow, looked

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror, and said, wow.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:90%
That's where we're going.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:90%
That's where we are already.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:34.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what people are
remembering, that truth.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the eradication
of all of humanity's

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.700 align:middle line:90%
perceived issues and problems.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And to really, fully--
we want to also help.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot us want to help
and be there at service.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.940 align:middle line:90%
How can we have find that?

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:84%
How can we find our purpose,
why we're here on this Earth

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:90%
at this time, our dharma?

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes helping
is schmearing.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So like sometimes you want
to whip out your inner healer

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
or your inner
guidance counselor,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and so what I've found to be the
most supportive way of helping

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.120 align:middle line:84%
somebody is just to hug
them, like literally just

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.160 align:middle line:90%
embrace them.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.877 align:middle line:84%
I've found that people
don't want a teaching.

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:13.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be fixed.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:14.776 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to be helped.

00:40:14.776 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:84%
They just want to be
held in whatever it

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.800 align:middle line:90%
is that they're experiencing.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you can hold them in
whatever it is that they're

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, it provides
them the space to just be

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:90%
with themselves in a new way.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's that we've all had those
moments where we're going

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:84%
through something in life,
and someone phones you

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and starts telling you
why what's going on,

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
why you should be
experiencing it,

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and if they were in
your position, how they

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:90%
would be doing it differently.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's just annoying,
isn't it, right?

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't help, right?

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.200 align:middle line:84%
You're just like, oh, my
God, please go away, right?

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, just
imagine if you could just

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.150 align:middle line:84%
have someone in your
life, just like a midwife,

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:84%
just hold space and just
embrace you in that moment.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
That would allow you
to just soften and just

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.820 align:middle line:84%
allow for whatever needs
to be felt to be felt.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:84%
So those of you that are into
techniques and modalities,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.655 align:middle line:84%
there's the most profound
one of all that's just a hug.

00:41:05.655 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:90%
It's revolutionary.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it has the
ability to transform

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:84%
people's lives in a way that
they can actually receive.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:17.300 align:middle line:84%
That's all people want, just to
be embraced for who they are.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.792 align:middle line:90%
That's all they want.

00:41:18.792 --> 00:41:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The intentions-- do you
talk about intentions, too,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.170 align:middle line:84%
or is it just something
that life just

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:90%
naturally arises when we are--

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Intentions are funny.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.210 align:middle line:84%
I once made the mistake
of setting an intention.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
do that, right?

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's let's say for example
you set the intention to be

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally loving, right?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Guess what happens?

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Your life shows you
everywhere in your experience

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
where you're not
unconditionally loving, right?

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.271 align:middle line:84%
So then all of a sudden,
everyone that irritates you

00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:90%
shows up.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Unconditionally
love this, right?

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Situations occur
in your reality.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.870 align:middle line:90%
So here's why I'm saying this.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.480 align:middle line:84%
The divine doesn't give
you what you ask for.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The divine gives you
an opportunity to grow

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:90%
into what you're asking for.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you set the intention
for unconditional love,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:84%
everywhere in your
life where you

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:84%
are not unconditionally
loving toward yourself

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.040 align:middle line:90%
begins to arise.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And the divine says,
OK, now embrace this.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Now embrace this.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Now embrace this.

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Now embrace this, right?

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
intentions are useful.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.740 align:middle line:84%
What I've found is
that most people,

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
intentions are getting
in the way of them

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:90%
just being and experiencing.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, if you're in
the absolute trust of yourself

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and your experience,
then you don't

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:84%
have to intend for
anything, nor do

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.510 align:middle line:90%
you have to manifest anything.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you just realize that
everything that's unfolding

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:84%
is unfolding in the absolute
perfection of itself.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you trust,
and you're along for the ride.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So any and all places where
you guys are not trusting

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.400 align:middle line:84%
in yourselves or
you're feeling the need

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to ask for things
because you feel

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.370 align:middle line:84%
like the absence of those
things means something

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.420 align:middle line:84%
about you, let's just
lovingly bring all of that up,

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.200 align:middle line:84%
just allow all that
to wash through you.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Because for some people, the
absence of a relationship

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:90%
just means they're unlovable.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The absence of money means
that they're not worthy, right?

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But what if it
doesn't mean anything?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.770 align:middle line:84%
What if it's just the
absence of a relationship

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.085 align:middle line:84%
and the absence of money,
and that's experiencing

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:90%
that you're having?

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is, that
when you can be at peace

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:84%
with that, all of a sudden,
things start to show up in ways

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:90%
that you can't even imagine.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's the blessing in
that, is being with what is,

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.000 align:middle line:84%
allowing consciousness
to do its job,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.280 align:middle line:84%
allowing life to do its
job, allowing the absence

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:90%
of something to do its job.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Because none of it is
a mistake-- none of it.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:90%
None of it.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And the heart-- do you
ever speak of the role

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.420 align:middle line:90%
of the heart in all of that?

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that it's something
powerful that emanates,

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:43.730 align:middle line:90%
that creates?

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Is that our kind
of power center?

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Or is it coming
from the whole body?

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you see it?

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a brilliant question.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Science is now proving that
the heart actually experiences

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:84%
everything first
before your mind,

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that we receive information
into the heart first.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The only issue is that we
don't leave it that way.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.570 align:middle line:84%
We then mentally
try to do something

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:90%
with what we're experiencing.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So we create meaning and
significance with what

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.890 align:middle line:90%
we're feeling and experiencing.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So, Lilou, everything
in our reality

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.550 align:middle line:84%
is experiential, like everything
in nature is experiential.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.250 align:middle line:84%
We're the only
species that analyzes

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.300 align:middle line:90%
everything-- everything, right?

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We try and find meaning and
significance around all of it,

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.760 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.710 align:middle line:84%
How about we could just leave it
alone and just be experiential,

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why zebras don't
come to seminars, right?

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:35.780 align:middle line:90%
They don't, right?

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Elephants don't come to
self-help workshops, do they?

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.450 align:middle line:90%
They don't read books, right?

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.009 align:middle line:84%
They don't, do they?
Why?

00:44:41.009 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just
experiencing themselves.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Elephants also don't compare
themselves to other elephants,

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.680 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:84%
An elephant is perfectly
content having the experience

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.810 align:middle line:90%
of being an elephant, right?

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So what if we could just
be perfectly content having

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:84%
the experience of being
human and give up the need

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to compare and contrast and
just be ourselves and be

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.350 align:middle line:84%
content with who we are
in the experience that

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.170 align:middle line:90%
is that we're having, right?

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Instead of making
ourselves a destination,

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:84%
let's just be here now, as my
friend Ram Dass likes to say,

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:08.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's just be here now.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's just be fully available
for this present moment.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's just be fully
available for the fullness

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.610 align:middle line:90%
of what is occurring right now.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we can be
available for that,

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that's a heart-centered way
of living and experiencing.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.750 align:middle line:84%
There is no cognitive
need to understand.

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.830 align:middle line:84%
There's no mental
process around it.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
The mind does what it does,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:84%
The heart is feeling
and experiencing.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And here's how we
can prove it, right?

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Every one of you has
walked into a room,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and before anyone
having a conversation,

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.180 align:middle line:84%
you feel on an intuitive level,
an energetic level, exactly

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.840 align:middle line:90%
what's happening, right?

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's had that experience.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do we know that?

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Because on a vibrational
level, our heart

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:56.060 align:middle line:84%
is picking up on what's
occurring before the mind.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Then your mind creates a
story around it, you see?

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But the key is to just be
in the experiencing of it

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:90%
on a heart level.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So another way of
describing this evolution

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is shifting out of our
mind into our hearts,

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:84%
being in our hearts,
being and feeling, being

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing, being in
the completion, being in love,

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:84%
being in oneness, being
in the inclusiveness,

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.300 align:middle line:90%
being in that principle.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
the mind turns off.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to find a
trick to turn off the mind,

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:31.651 align:middle line:84%
because if we're in the heart,
we can't be in the mind.

00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.910 align:middle line:84%
The mind is not the
enemy, you know.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like, stop thinking.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Trying to stop thinking is
like trying to stop Niagara

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Falls from being a waterfall.

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.130 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.784 align:middle line:84%
It's like you sit there, you're
trying to stop thinking, right?

00:46:47.784 --> 00:46:48.950 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
is, when I see most

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:52.860 align:middle line:84%
people that are meditating,
they look like they constipated.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.430 align:middle line:90%
They're not relaxed, right?

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.270 align:middle line:84%
They're efforting
with every fiber

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:58.460 align:middle line:90%
of their being to be calm.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.480 align:middle line:90%
How's that working?

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not, is it, right?

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So the key is, meditation,
as I define it,

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.180 align:middle line:84%
is the divine art
of chilling out.

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Chill out.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Take some breaths.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And then just be with
whatever is occurring.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:90%
The mind is not the enemy.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.340 align:middle line:90%
The mind is not the enemy.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are
not wrong or bad.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Just let be, leave it alone.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Let it be, and
watch what happens.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Watch The miraculous unfold.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.850 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.280 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to be you.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:34.470 align:middle line:10%
Just be you.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.910 align:middle line:10%
Just relax.

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.390 align:middle line:10%
Don't try to be enlightened.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Just realize that you're
already enlightened.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Be enlightened.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to become abundant.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.180 align:middle line:10%
You are abundant.

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to be healed.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Our body has an amazing
ability to heal itself.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:10%
We won't allow it
to heal itself.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to heal itself.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to come into harmony.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to do what it's
designed to do, right?

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Be in whatever you are
feeling, relax, and experience

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.255 align:middle line:90%
the fullness of this truth.

00:48:09.255 --> 00:48:09.955 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:48:09.955 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Panache, for
this delicious conversation,

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.730 align:middle line:90%
this delicious talk.

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.581 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate
your presence.

00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
-Thank you, Lilou.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure and
an honor, as always.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to all the
people that are tuning in.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Lots of love to all of them.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, lots of love,
beautiful, delicious,

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:26.310 align:middle line:84%
co-creators all
around the world.

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:29.340 align:middle line:84%
This was another beautiful
interview and conversation

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.480 align:middle line:90%
here for Gaiam TV.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.171 align:middle line:84%
Much, much love wherever
you are around the world.

00:48:33.171 --> 00:48:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Bye-bye.
-Bye.
