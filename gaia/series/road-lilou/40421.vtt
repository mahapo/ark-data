[ Music ]

00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:13.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Hello my delicious
co-creators, Lilou here.

00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:16.851 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the road in
London, in rainy London,

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:21.088 align:middle line:84%
for another juicy conversation
I'm excited to have this moment

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.657 align:middle line:84%
with you, Lars, because you're
from all the way from Denmark.

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:26.694 align:middle line:84%
But you happen to be
published by Watkins.

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:28.529 align:middle line:84%
So, it's perfect because
you're here in town

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.697 align:middle line:90%
to do some conferences.

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.466 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
brought us together

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.902 align:middle line:84%
for this beautiful
conversation I feel we're going

00:00:34.902 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:90%
to enjoy this very much.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So, thank you for being
available and being here.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.242 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: Thank you
for having me.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm so excited too.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.012 align:middle line:84%
It is really, you
know, some of those--

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
those synchronicities that
the universe is full of.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:51.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: So--

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you have a-- it's
really, really interesting story

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.823 align:middle line:90%
and I'm excited to dig into it.

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.692 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of this
trilogy, "The O Manuscript"

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.394 align:middle line:90%
that a lot of people speak of.

00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:04.298 align:middle line:84%
And-- But this is-- this is
something that is fabulous.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.234 align:middle line:84%
And as we said earlier, that
happens to a lot of people.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:10.371 align:middle line:84%
Something-- Something, something
happens at a certain point

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:13.841 align:middle line:84%
in our life and this changes
the whole course for you.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:17.645 align:middle line:84%
It was really, really at an
early age, at the age of 10.

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:19.413 align:middle line:90%
Now, tell us what happened then.

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:24.051 align:middle line:84%
'Cause I know a lot people can
relate and can learn from this.

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:25.186 align:middle line:90%
And we can learn more--

00:01:25.186 --> 00:01:28.956 align:middle line:84%
how is your view of life
now and your reality?

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.692 align:middle line:90%
In short, when I was 10 years,

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:38.831 align:middle line:84%
my sister who is 6-years
old died from a brain tumor.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.502 align:middle line:84%
And just before that,
you know, I mean, we--

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:45.139 align:middle line:84%
it was really a sole
meeting, her and me.

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:49.944 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, as-- if you have
sisters or brothers yourself

00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and you're the first one,
when you come into the world,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.381 align:middle line:90%
you get all their attention.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.686 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, this little angel
with big brown eyes, you know,

00:01:58.686 --> 00:01:59.954 align:middle line:90%
who gets all the attention.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:05.659 align:middle line:84%
And at one point in all--
you know, a child is--

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.101 align:middle line:84%
I just thought-- I really hope
that she wasn't there anymore.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.371 align:middle line:84%
And of course I didn't mean
it but that was really my--

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.341 align:middle line:90%
when she died shortly after.

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.243 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine what
that did to me

00:02:22.243 --> 00:02:24.111 align:middle line:84%
because that was
my first meeting

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.015 align:middle line:84%
with how thoughts can
influence everything, thoughts

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and our child-free thoughts
really creates energy

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.655 align:middle line:90%
and reality.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:36.624 align:middle line:84%
And of course I didn't
know anything

00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.192 align:middle line:90%
about that at that time.

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:40.794 align:middle line:84%
But it completely changed
my life and I was--

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:44.898 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to go to
school every night just

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.734 align:middle line:90%
before pre-sleep.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:51.972 align:middle line:84%
I experience some what you
can call some Kundalini

00:02:51.972 --> 00:02:56.443 align:middle line:84%
like movements, like plants
going up through my body and out

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:58.879 align:middle line:84%
to my skull, and
out in the universe.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.649 align:middle line:84%
And it was very painful,
very frightful,

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.019 align:middle line:84%
every single night
for two years.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.656 align:middle line:84%
So, I tried not to come
into this state but it--

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It was automatic.

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:11.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yes, it was.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.862 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get to sleep
I was supposed to get.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.964 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't follow school.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:21.468 align:middle line:90%
And this is in the midst of 50s.

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:24.705 align:middle line:84%
So, people then didn't know
what to do with a boy like that.

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.907 align:middle line:84%
So, they adjusted
let me go, you know?

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:28.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Did you
let your parents know

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:29.777 align:middle line:90%
or you talk to people?

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Or you were keeping those
experiences to yourself?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: I started
writing at that point.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.788 align:middle line:84%
And I started experiencing
very other's realities.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.291 align:middle line:90%
I became sensitive.

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.628 align:middle line:84%
Something that really disturbed
me and still does to that day

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:53.701 align:middle line:84%
in fact is that I was-- I could
see through people in a way

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:57.271 align:middle line:84%
that I could see that
they felt something,

00:03:57.271 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
that they said something else

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and did something completely
different, you know?

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.548 align:middle line:84%
There was no alignment between
thinking, saying, and doing.

00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:10.117 align:middle line:84%
And that really frightened
me as a child.

00:04:10.117 --> 00:04:13.287 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really wanted
to be here.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:16.523 align:middle line:84%
And I think I have met
so many people working

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:20.661 align:middle line:84%
with the spiritual, spirituality
and stuff, and what goes

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:24.932 align:middle line:84%
for everybody is they have felt
exactly the same when they came

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:27.534 align:middle line:84%
into the earth plain
and in the first time.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:29.603 align:middle line:90%
What I'm doing here?

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:30.938 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:32.606 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: They really-- you
know, a lot of people are so--

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:38.112 align:middle line:84%
feeling so estranged and doesn't
just-- what are we doing here?

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.914 align:middle line:84%
There is a feeling sometimes
and I felt that too personally.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:43.984 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure a lot people watching
this paranoia, kind of you're

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:46.854 align:middle line:84%
like am I-- am I-- why am
I feeling all those things?

00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:49.823 align:middle line:84%
Am I paranoic about the
surroundings, are other people?

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:51.225 align:middle line:90%
Or is that the real thing?

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult to dissociate.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: And I think the
more sensitive you are,

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:58.732 align:middle line:84%
the harder it is
to be here really.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:03.137 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it took me 48 years
to really come into the body

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:05.139 align:middle line:90%
and incarnate and say, "Yes.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Now I know why I'm here.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.543 align:middle line:84%
And now I really
want to be here."

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.779 align:middle line:84%
It's rather late,
you know, but--

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you--
So you start--

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.849 align:middle line:90%
you start writing this journal.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.585 align:middle line:84%
You're still having those
Kundalini experiences

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:19.887 align:middle line:90%
that are painful.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.456 align:middle line:84%
But they are still bringing
some kind of information.

00:05:22.456 --> 00:05:24.525 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how-- how are you
dealing with all of this?

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.794 align:middle line:84%
What are you really
writing in your journal?

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:27.628 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: No.

00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:31.265 align:middle line:90%
This isn't my reality anymore.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:33.367 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a
child, this was--

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
for five years or
something, my reality.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
writing everything down.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.676 align:middle line:84%
I could also feel
other people's pain.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:48.649 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was a
lot of weird existences

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:49.616 align:middle line:90%
at that time, you know?

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:52.352 align:middle line:90%
There was a dwarf woman.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.854 align:middle line:90%
Her reality became mine.

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:57.324 align:middle line:84%
There was the man who never
who-- who won't married,

00:05:57.324 --> 00:06:01.261 align:middle line:84%
who always were in his
working clothes and eating food

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:04.198 align:middle line:84%
out of the tin, you know,
and stuff like that.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:08.735 align:middle line:84%
It all went into-- to what
you can call my protocol

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.337 align:middle line:90%
that I was writing.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:14.374 align:middle line:84%
And when I was 15-years old,
I was so really miserable,

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.376 align:middle line:90%
really, really miserable.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.613 align:middle line:84%
And one day, this was
before e-mail of course.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1964.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.386 align:middle line:84%
I got an envelope
with no sender.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.388 align:middle line:90%
There was no sender of it.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:32.326 align:middle line:84%
And when I opened it, of course,
the whole family was on my back

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:34.595 align:middle line:84%
and just, "Wow, what
was that all about?"

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.331 align:middle line:84%
And out came a little--
a small book

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle line:84%
of the Supreme Master has
wrapped and I have come.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That was
in English or Danish?

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:44.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: In Danish.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:48.509 align:middle line:84%
And it was some aphorism of this
man I have never heard of him

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.712 align:middle line:84%
of course, but that
really saved my life.

00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:53.881 align:middle line:90%
And that was my-- the beginning

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:57.918 align:middle line:84%
of my spiritual journey
in a conscious way.

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.521 align:middle line:84%
The first aphorism
that met my eye

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:03.724 align:middle line:84%
when I opened the book
was some saying like this,

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:07.895 align:middle line:84%
"If you will come
forward towards us,

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:12.132 align:middle line:84%
we will bow down
and lift you up."

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:13.934 align:middle line:90%
And that read-- when I thought--

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.969 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, "OK,
you're not alone."

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.372 align:middle line:84%
That somebody out
there that looks

00:07:18.372 --> 00:07:21.041 align:middle line:84%
after you and-- but,
you know, then--

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: There was
teachings in there?

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:24.044 align:middle line:90%
There was esoteric teachings?

00:07:24.044 --> 00:07:25.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: Aphorisms,
you know, small--

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Informations, OK.

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:27.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:31.618 align:middle line:84%
So, I had to leave
school at that time.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.754 align:middle line:90%
And I have no musical.

00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:37.758 align:middle line:84%
I'm basing so-- anything,
but I was a musical kid.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:40.827 align:middle line:84%
And I have been-- instead
of going to school,

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
I went to all the churches
during the day whether the organ

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:46.433 align:middle line:90%
player was training.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:51.805 align:middle line:84%
So I knew the schedule for
all the churches around town.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:55.142 align:middle line:84%
So that was my musical
education.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:59.212 align:middle line:84%
So, when the youth movement
came with the beat music and all

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:02.816 align:middle line:84%
of that, I just became
the member of a band.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:07.421 align:middle line:84%
And that was really it
and I found identity

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.257 align:middle line:84%
and I could make a
living in the music.

00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:15.729 align:middle line:84%
And for 35 years, that became my
what you can call my identity.

00:08:15.729 --> 00:08:20.968 align:middle line:84%
But behind that, everyday,
24 hours a day almost,

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:27.374 align:middle line:84%
I was starting all the big
religion, the philosophy,

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
all the spiritual
traditions of the world.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So, that was really
my main thing.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:40.053 align:middle line:84%
And the music thing showbiz was
just a kind of to legitimate--

00:08:40.053 --> 00:08:41.821 align:middle line:90%
what do you call that?

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:42.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Legitimate.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:43.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yes, my being here.

00:08:43.924 --> 00:08:44.625 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:49.997 align:middle line:84%
So you were-- so you were
learning and practicing,

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.398 align:middle line:90%
and you're still writing?

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:52.232 align:middle line:90%
How is it?

00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:53.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: I wasn't practicing.

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.434 align:middle line:90%
I was just reading.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:55.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: OK.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:56.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: I was really reading

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:59.573 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted information
about all of this.

00:08:59.573 --> 00:09:06.647 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, it was also a
kind of getaway from this life

00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:09.316 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
really stand being here.

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:12.519 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know how to be here

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:17.991 align:middle line:84%
and to give whatever I was
here to give, you know?

00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.728 align:middle line:84%
So after many, many years
when I was 40-years old,

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.632 align:middle line:84%
my father he came to
my birthday party.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:31.405 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I have just
decided to leave the business,

00:09:31.405 --> 00:09:33.473 align:middle line:90%
stop to worrying, anyway go to--

00:09:33.473 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and leave on a small
island in Denmark.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And before that, I had this
party for all my friends,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.015 align:middle line:84%
in the businesses,
and social form.

00:09:42.015 --> 00:09:45.018 align:middle line:84%
And when my father came
to the party, he gave a--

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:48.088 align:middle line:90%
he brought a big envelope.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.391 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Before
you go into the party,

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.061 align:middle line:90%
just sit down and look at this."

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.963 align:middle line:90%
So I opened it and immediately

00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:00.867 align:middle line:84%
when I saw those yellow
pages of that old protocol.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I recognized the
handwriting in front

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
because that was Lars
Muhl, 12-years old.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.575 align:middle line:84%
And it maybe was the
most beautiful gift

00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.744 align:middle line:90%
that you can get on your 40.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:16.383 align:middle line:84%
It's birthday from a 12-years
old kid to a 40-year old man.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:19.786 align:middle line:84%
So, they all came back
to me, all the things

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:24.458 align:middle line:84%
that I have forgotten about,
how I could-- the sensitivity,

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:29.529 align:middle line:84%
the dwarfs, the poor man,
the-- I mean, everything.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:30.997 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And your father
actually was accepting it too?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah, I know.

00:10:35.902 --> 00:10:36.737 align:middle line:84%
They have just-- they
have just found it,

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:38.271 align:middle line:90%
you know, in some old papers.

00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:40.507 align:middle line:90%
And they just gave it to me.

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:41.875 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: They had to read it
because that happens I think

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:45.312 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of-- it's
like keeping journals.

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:47.047 align:middle line:90%
But then, the parents see it.

00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:50.517 align:middle line:84%
And years later and like, "Oh my
God, my children, my child went

00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:52.085 align:middle line:90%
through all of that, whoa!"

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:54.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: They have
known it all the time.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:57.424 align:middle line:84%
And they just let me have it,
you know, because the knew

00:10:57.424 --> 00:11:03.029 align:middle line:84%
that me writing was my
safe line in all of that.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:08.935 align:middle line:84%
So, when I read that, I thought,
"If you can forget that,

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:10.871 align:middle line:90%
there must be so much more."

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:15.442 align:middle line:84%
So that was really the start
of me writing myself back

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:20.747 align:middle line:84%
into my own mentality to find
out what was hidden there.

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:24.151 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that in
fact, that is some saying

00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:29.222 align:middle line:84%
that I give it as
advice to people

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:32.292 align:middle line:90%
who seek me out, that go home.

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:35.362 align:middle line:84%
Try to remember as
far back as you can.

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:39.332 align:middle line:84%
At one point I could really
remember myself lying one

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:42.369 align:middle line:84%
and half year old on the
kitchen table being nursed

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:46.807 align:middle line:84%
by a young girl that nobody
have ever told me about.

00:11:46.807 --> 00:11:49.743 align:middle line:84%
So, I told my mother
and she said, "Yeah,

00:11:49.743 --> 00:11:51.812 align:middle line:90%
but I've forgotten all about it.

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.213 align:middle line:90%
How can you remember?"

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:84%
"I don't know if she was real
or what," "Yeah, but she was."

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.685 align:middle line:90%
So, you can really go back.

00:11:58.685 --> 00:11:59.352 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:00.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:01.655 align:middle line:84%
And people go back
to past lives.

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:02.722 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that was--

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: I did, you know?

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:06.827 align:middle line:90%
Back to the room, before.

00:12:06.827 --> 00:12:08.662 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, so--

00:12:08.662 --> 00:12:09.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.331 align:middle line:84%
Were you channeling
to some information?

00:12:11.331 --> 00:12:14.501 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that you went
for three years in a bed

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.337 align:middle line:84%
and had a big disease and a
lot of things happened then.

00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:19.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: When I went to that
island and started this work,

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:22.542 align:middle line:84%
everything was just--
I mean, I thought,

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.044 align:middle line:90%
"This was perfect," you know?

00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:27.514 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, I was stuck
ill and I was lying down.

00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:32.853 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could give me any clue
of what was wrong with me.

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:38.358 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, if you imagine
an iron pole coming in here

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:39.659 align:middle line:90%
and out here, you know?

00:12:39.659 --> 00:12:42.963 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- and it
was really painful.

00:12:42.963 --> 00:12:47.601 align:middle line:84%
And yet, everyday, I
was trying to get up of

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.002 align:middle line:90%
that mud hole, you know.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle line:84%
And every time I was just about
to get a hold of something,

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.307 align:middle line:90%
I just fell down again.

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:58.245 align:middle line:84%
And I had to wait to the
next day to start all over.

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:02.482 align:middle line:84%
For two years, it went on like
nobody could give me a diagnosis

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:03.683 align:middle line:90%
on anything.

00:13:03.683 --> 00:13:08.622 align:middle line:84%
So, one day, something
call it grace or whatever,

00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:12.058 align:middle line:84%
after three years, something
really different came in,

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:13.059 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.762 align:middle line:84%
Everyday for all
those, in all that time,

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:18.932 align:middle line:84%
everybody I have been
arguing with God.

00:13:18.932 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Dear God, help me.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.771 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me why
I'm lying here

00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:27.574 align:middle line:84%
so I can be a better
person, you know?

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:31.011 align:middle line:84%
I'll be the best boy
you have ever put on.

00:13:31.011 --> 00:13:32.545 align:middle line:90%
I'll never go over the ladies.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:34.047 align:middle line:90%
I'll never smoke.

00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:36.148 align:middle line:90%
I will never do anything.

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:39.419 align:middle line:84%
But He-- there was
never any answer

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:42.455 align:middle line:90%
and I was completely on my own.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:45.292 align:middle line:90%
But one day, after three years,

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.694 align:middle line:84%
something completely different
happened because instead

00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:54.501 align:middle line:84%
of me lying there having, you
know, complaining and arguing,

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:57.203 align:middle line:84%
there was a new thought
coming in that said,

00:13:57.203 --> 00:14:01.041 align:middle line:84%
"When your aligned here
and feeling so much pain,

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:04.611 align:middle line:84%
more pain than you can
imagine, then why not take

00:14:04.611 --> 00:14:06.579 align:middle line:84%
on yourself the pain
of the world?"

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:12.819 align:middle line:84%
It sounds a little bit like,
you know, over the top maybe.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But from that moment, I was
kind of-- I was taken out--

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.397 align:middle line:90%
I was standing beside the bed.

00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:90%
There was no pain.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.268 align:middle line:90%
I was neutralized in a way.

00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:29.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: From the moment--

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.771 align:middle line:84%
so tell us again that
moment you decided

00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:34.174 align:middle line:84%
to take home the pain the
world instead of just your self

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:35.475 align:middle line:90%
and that's when things shift?

00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:36.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.545 align:middle line:90%
It was not something I decided.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:41.081 align:middle line:84%
It was this thought that
came in from somewhere.

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was a kind of
help, a grace that came in.

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:48.588 align:middle line:90%
And from that moment,

00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:55.195 align:middle line:84%
the meaningless got
meaning, you know?

00:14:55.195 --> 00:14:58.298 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, it became
meaningful to lie there

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:01.701 align:middle line:84%
because I did it
for the whole world.

00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:06.106 align:middle line:84%
And then the next--
the week after,

00:15:06.106 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
a colleague of mine
phoned me up and ask me,

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.012 align:middle line:90%
"What's wrong with you?"

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:15.148 align:middle line:84%
because she-- I never came
around anymore and stopped.

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:17.017 align:middle line:90%
So, I said, "Yeah, so and so".

00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:18.885 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "Why
didn't you tell me?

00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:21.154 align:middle line:84%
Because I know a man
who can help you."

00:15:21.154 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So, I got the phone number
for the man that I called

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.362 align:middle line:90%
"The Seer" in my book.

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:31.898 align:middle line:84%
And that was been the
beginning of a new life.

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:36.703 align:middle line:84%
I phoned him up and after a
few weeks of trying to call him

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:41.174 align:middle line:84%
between eight and nine in
the morning, I got to him

00:15:41.174 --> 00:15:44.811 align:middle line:84%
and he fixed me within
five minutes on the phone.

00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:46.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: How do
you define a seer?

00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:48.648 align:middle line:84%
Because it's interesting
the past days just

00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:90%
that this is the second day?

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.352 align:middle line:84%
I'm shooting some in
London and this is

00:15:52.352 --> 00:15:54.254 align:middle line:90%
where it comes back very often.

00:15:54.254 --> 00:15:57.557 align:middle line:84%
So, it's going to come to
also the people's attention

00:15:57.557 --> 00:15:59.092 align:middle line:84%
that are watching this
video and everything.

00:15:59.092 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:90%
So, how do you define a seer?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.397 align:middle line:84%
Because I find it quite
interesting how life sometimes

00:16:04.397 --> 00:16:05.865 align:middle line:90%
bring some synchronicities

00:16:05.865 --> 00:16:08.868 align:middle line:84%
around a particular
topic or words, you know?

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:13.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: The seer was a man
who had the ability to look

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
through people and it
didn't matter they were

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of the globe.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.316 align:middle line:84%
People, they phoned him from
all over the world between eight

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.452 align:middle line:90%
and nine every morning.

00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:28.688 align:middle line:84%
And he just diagnosed
them and healed them.

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's different
than of psychic?

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:31.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:34.627 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was-- he just
had this ability, you know?

00:16:34.627 --> 00:16:36.896 align:middle line:84%
If you had something with
your liver or your kidney,

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:39.398 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, he just said,
"Vivian,

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:41.935 align:middle line:90%
you have something with your--

00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:46.773 align:middle line:84%
" After I met him and started
working with him for four

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:50.143 align:middle line:84%
or five years, I
have been sitting

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:53.379 align:middle line:84%
by his side every morning
for months on things

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:57.183 align:middle line:84%
and just listening to and
seeing what he was doing.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.653 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, all the time, I
was waiting to get some recipe,

00:17:00.653 --> 00:17:03.189 align:middle line:84%
you know, for what he
was doing but it never--

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:05.258 align:middle line:90%
there never was any recipe.

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:08.293 align:middle line:90%
But he just went-- he had this--

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:11.464 align:middle line:84%
every morning we
started from seven

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:14.434 align:middle line:84%
to eight just to
sit in his office.

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:17.604 align:middle line:84%
And at one time, I said,
"Oh, let's go and meditate."

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:18.905 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Meditate?

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.373 align:middle line:90%
We are not meditating.

00:17:20.373 --> 00:17:23.842 align:middle line:90%
We are sitting, just being, OK?"

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:26.779 align:middle line:84%
So we sat there every
morning, just being.

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:32.418 align:middle line:84%
And then, when-- while being,
he connected maybe to that day

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:37.824 align:middle line:90%
to Orion or Isis, or whatever.

00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:41.828 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this man had never
read a book in his life

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:45.365 align:middle line:84%
but he just connected
through different kind

00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.467 align:middle line:90%
of fixtures, you know?

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:51.004 align:middle line:84%
And it felt it was
Orion that day.

00:17:51.004 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
He would use Orion as a
fixture for healing and his--

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.979 align:middle line:84%
the way of-- in what
way, I don't know.

00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:02.515 align:middle line:84%
He just-- when people they
phoned him, he just said,

00:18:02.515 --> 00:18:05.151 align:middle line:84%
"Do you mind me go
out and ask Orion?"

00:18:05.151 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:90%
"No, no," people said.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.722 align:middle line:84%
They had no idea
what was going on.

00:18:09.722 --> 00:18:12.258 align:middle line:84%
"No, no as long as
you help me, please."

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:90%
So, he went out to Orion.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.161 align:middle line:90%
He said, "Yes.

00:18:15.161 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
This and that, and you
must go to a doctor

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.399 align:middle line:90%
and get your this and that.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.768 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix it.

00:18:21.768 --> 00:18:23.369 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
10 o'clock today?"

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I don't
know," people said.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.211 align:middle line:84%
"OK. Be ready there
because exactly 10 o'clock,

00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll fix it."

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.548 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes also people
have phoned,

00:18:35.548 --> 00:18:39.252 align:middle line:84%
they had maybe a back
pain or something

00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "OK,
let me see it."

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.489 align:middle line:84%
One minute later,
he said, "Yeah.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:48.461 align:middle line:84%
Don't get excited
but you have cancer."

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.664 align:middle line:84%
"Cancer?" "Yeah, but don't
worry because I'll fix it.

00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:56.336 align:middle line:84%
But you go to the hospital
and get an X-ray and phone me

00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:58.338 align:middle line:84%
when you-- that's
just to be sure

00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:00.073 align:middle line:90%
that what I'm saying is right."

00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:02.442 align:middle line:84%
And they-- of course, they
were completely out of it

00:19:02.442 --> 00:19:03.509 align:middle line:90%
when they phoned back.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.545 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, there's a cancer!"

00:19:05.545 --> 00:19:08.214 align:middle line:84%
"Didn't I tell you
to take it easy?

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:09.048 align:middle line:90%
We will fix it."

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:12.018 align:middle line:90%
Three days later, it was fixed.

00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:17.557 align:middle line:84%
So, that was his way of-- and
that was just an ability he had.

00:19:17.557 --> 00:19:22.929 align:middle line:84%
But beside his-- what he
call his professional eye,

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.831 align:middle line:90%
he was also a person.

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:27.867 align:middle line:84%
And he had a lot of
what do you call it?

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:30.637 align:middle line:84%
Fightings, or what
do you call it?

00:19:30.637 --> 00:19:33.773 align:middle line:84%
Stuff, personal stuff
that he had to work with.

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:38.411 align:middle line:84%
And that you would never
combine to that seer,

00:19:38.411 --> 00:19:40.446 align:middle line:90%
a professional part of him.

00:19:40.446 --> 00:19:45.218 align:middle line:84%
And I came to understand
that that goes for everybody.

00:19:45.218 --> 00:19:51.391 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he have higher self
that often works through us

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:55.028 align:middle line:84%
but we have all this personal
stuff that we have to deal with

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:59.299 align:middle line:84%
and that's really what we
are here for to deal with it

00:19:59.299 --> 00:20:04.537 align:middle line:84%
and to transform it to be
part of the higher self.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:20:05.772 --> 00:20:08.141 align:middle line:84%
So, as you were meeting
him, you were recording him

00:20:08.141 --> 00:20:11.811 align:middle line:84%
and this is part of the
first book of the trilogy?

00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:14.747 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were receiving
information,

00:20:14.747 --> 00:20:16.683 align:middle line:90%
getting healed, getting clarity?

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:18.985 align:middle line:84%
And what was the
process for you?

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:21.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: My problem, lying
down for three years,

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:84%
was that I've been
reading all this stuff

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:28.561 align:middle line:84%
without really giving
it legs to walk on.

00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:84%
So, that was my kind of--
the first day he met me,

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:37.737 align:middle line:84%
he looked at me and said,
"What the hell are you doing?"

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:41.107 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I don't really know.

00:20:41.107 --> 00:20:43.576 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?"

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:46.112 align:middle line:84%
"You were standing with
your back to world.

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That's not what you
are here for.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.217 align:middle line:84%
You are here to-- " and
the first time we went

00:20:51.217 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
up to the mountain, the
Holy Mountain of Montague

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.492 align:middle line:84%
in southern France, I got the
notion that this will mean

00:20:59.492 --> 00:21:02.261 align:middle line:90%
that I have to three books.

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.364 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
didn't know anything

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:06.666 align:middle line:90%
about how that could be.

00:21:06.666 --> 00:21:10.203 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening, he said
to me, "Yes, that's right.

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:84%
You will. I'll be part of the
two of them but the third one,

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.609 align:middle line:90%
something else will happen."

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.911 align:middle line:90%
And that happened exactly as--

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.981 align:middle line:84%
>> So, it's when you
were sorts of friends

00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:24.851 align:middle line:90%
that Magdalene got there?

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:25.551 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: No.

00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:27.353 align:middle line:90%
You know, long time ago.

00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:28.721 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I started working

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.924 align:middle line:84%
with the Magdalene
in the 80s already.

00:21:31.924 --> 00:21:36.029 align:middle line:90%
And I have also been very much

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:39.198 align:middle line:84%
into the Aramaic
language that Jesus spoke.

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:43.669 align:middle line:84%
I started also studying
that when I was in the 80s.

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So, all that became a completely
eye opener for me into the life

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.981 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus and also to Mary
Magdalene because in my view,

00:21:54.981 --> 00:22:02.388 align:middle line:84%
you can't name Yeshua without
naming also Mary the Magdalene.

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:03.256 align:middle line:90%
They go together.

00:22:03.256 --> 00:22:05.425 align:middle line:90%
He is the first new man.

00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:08.561 align:middle line:84%
She is the first
new woman to me.

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.697 align:middle line:90%
So they are archetypal persons.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:15.501 align:middle line:84%
And when I met the seer
and started working

00:22:15.501 --> 00:22:19.272 align:middle line:84%
with the Magdalene for
real and started writing,

00:22:19.272 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
you should remember this is
long before the Dan Brown book,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.112 align:middle line:90%
long before.

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:33.019 align:middle line:84%
This is late 90s,
you know, 1990s.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:38.057 align:middle line:84%
So-- Then I found
out and that this--

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
what I'm telling you now
might be also interesting

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.566 align:middle line:84%
for everybody else who works
with the spiritual work is

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:50.369 align:middle line:84%
that I found out that this
man, he couldn't connect to all

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:54.841 align:middle line:84%
of the things that he--
where he had some prejudices.

00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:56.542 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:01.614 align:middle line:84%
I really apologize
for my broken English.

00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:02.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: That was great.

00:23:02.315 --> 00:23:03.282 align:middle line:90%
I could-- we can--

00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:04.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: You understand
what I mean?

00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.486 align:middle line:84%
OK. Just help me out
if you see that I'm--

00:23:06.486 --> 00:23:07.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I'm French.

00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:08.521 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I have
a broken English too.

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: OK.

00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:09.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: We're good.

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:10.389 align:middle line:90%
We're good.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:11.057 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:12.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: All right.

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:16.362 align:middle line:84%
So, if you have some
prejudices against--

00:23:16.362 --> 00:23:18.264 align:middle line:90%
and the seer, he had this.

00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:23.803 align:middle line:84%
He own in you one Jesus and
that was the Catholic Jesus.

00:23:23.803 --> 00:23:26.639 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he have
never heard about Yeshua.

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:30.476 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of Christians have
never heard about Yeshua

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:32.812 align:middle line:90%
which is Jesus' real name.

00:23:32.812 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:84%
So, in order to understand
what's hidden there,

00:23:37.383 --> 00:23:42.188 align:middle line:84%
at that time when I started
learning the Aramaic language,

00:23:42.188 --> 00:23:45.958 align:middle line:84%
I was all into the Coptic
scriptures, you know,

00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:50.963 align:middle line:84%
the Gospel of Tomas,
the Gospel of Philips,

00:23:50.963 --> 00:23:54.267 align:middle line:90%
and all the agnostic gospels.

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:59.405 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really care
about the New Testament.

00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:84%
But through the most
wonderful psychology

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:09.582 align:middle line:84%
that is behind the language
that Jesus spoke, I mean,

00:24:09.582 --> 00:24:11.984 align:middle line:84%
everything is in
the New Testament.

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I really found that out.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.558 align:middle line:84%
Everyday is like the rose is
blooming and it's blooming

00:24:18.558 --> 00:24:19.692 align:middle line:90%
and it's blooming, you know?

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:21.027 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:24:21.027 --> 00:24:25.431 align:middle line:84%
You can even find centric
lessons in the New Testament,

00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:28.034 align:middle line:84%
the bridal chamber
mystery and all the stuff

00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:30.203 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus is talking about.

00:24:30.203 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So, I found out that Mary
Magdalene was very much part

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.641 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:38.144 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
wonderful sayings

00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:43.149 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus actually
declared how it all is

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:47.787 align:middle line:90%
that she is his spiritual bride.

00:24:47.787 --> 00:24:55.828 align:middle line:84%
And that she means so much
to Him and His message.

00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Just remember, you remember
when-- just before the cross,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.372 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is performing
the washing of the feet

00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:10.509 align:middle line:84%
of His disciples,
the last sermon.

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:14.747 align:middle line:84%
We seem to forget that the
inspiration for that was given

00:25:14.747 --> 00:25:21.153 align:middle line:84%
to him from Mary Magdalene
when she anointed his feet

00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:26.792 align:middle line:84%
with her tears and
dried it with her hair.

00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:32.498 align:middle line:84%
That was really her
inspiration to Him.

00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:35.134 align:middle line:84%
He took it out and showed
the world that it came

00:25:35.134 --> 00:25:38.771 align:middle line:90%
from her saying that only those

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:43.075 align:middle line:84%
who can serve can
really be masters.

00:25:43.075 --> 00:25:45.745 align:middle line:84%
So, there are so many
beautiful things there,

00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:50.916 align:middle line:84%
in there that completely changes
everything you ever thought

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:55.021 align:middle line:84%
or knew about Yeshua
and the Magdalene.

00:25:55.021 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And taking it in our
own lives, what does this mean

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.961 align:middle line:84%
for human beings having--
seeing that and reading that,

00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:03.696 align:middle line:90%
and learning that for you?

00:26:03.696 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: It means that, you
know, despite that a lot

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
of us are not performing
Christians, but we are raised

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.378 align:middle line:84%
in Christian society
one way or the other.

00:26:19.378 --> 00:26:23.683 align:middle line:84%
I myself come from a completely
non-religious background,

00:26:23.683 --> 00:26:26.052 align:middle line:84%
strictly working
class, you know?

00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:29.588 align:middle line:84%
We went to church if
there was wedding or,

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.257 align:middle line:90%
you know, stuff like that.

00:26:31.257 --> 00:26:39.231 align:middle line:84%
So, it means that we-- whether
we are performing Christians

00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:45.771 align:middle line:84%
or not, we carry the archetype
of Jesus and the Magdalene

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:49.642 align:middle line:84%
and stuff inside us, and
mother Mary also of course.

00:26:49.642 --> 00:26:52.445 align:middle line:84%
So they have just
kind of waiting

00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:55.915 align:middle line:84%
to be explored and
to be unfolded.

00:26:55.915 --> 00:27:00.619 align:middle line:84%
But we have-- you got the have
the key to do it, to understand

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:07.526 align:middle line:84%
because the Aramaic language and
psychology is so broad compared

00:27:07.526 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to our way of thinking
and our psychology.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.967 align:middle line:84%
So, it's so vast that it's--
the whole universe is opening

00:27:14.967 --> 00:27:17.536 align:middle line:90%
up when you have this key.

00:27:17.536 --> 00:27:20.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What I meant is,
what are some of the lessons?

00:27:20.706 --> 00:27:23.008 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do we need also
to realize ourselves

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:26.512 align:middle line:84%
through another being
and being in couple?

00:27:26.512 --> 00:27:29.248 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean we
definitely have to open up?

00:27:29.248 --> 00:27:31.217 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean in
our society, you know,

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:33.385 align:middle line:84%
taking this further
all those lessons?

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:35.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: I think first
of all, you know,

00:27:35.921 --> 00:27:39.125 align:middle line:84%
when the church was
established and all that,

00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:41.060 align:middle line:90%
it was really a kind of closing

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.097 align:middle line:84%
down of the holy
centers of the sexuality.

00:27:45.097 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So, we have so many
scars in that department.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:56.475 align:middle line:84%
And the Mary Magdalene who was
a room priestess, she's really--

00:27:56.475 --> 00:28:02.081 align:middle line:84%
you should remember that
until 415 or something,

00:28:02.081 --> 00:28:09.021 align:middle line:84%
the Mother Mary didn't have
any place in the church.

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:13.993 align:middle line:84%
It was because the
people wanted their kind

00:28:13.993 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of their goddess back
into their religion.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.534 align:middle line:84%
And the church fathers didn't
know really what to do about it

00:28:21.534 --> 00:28:27.206 align:middle line:84%
so they went into plenum
and they found out,

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.509 align:middle line:90%
"Oh, the Mother of Christ.

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:31.477 align:middle line:90%
We can take..she will..."

00:28:31.477 --> 00:28:33.946 align:middle line:84%
And see, you've done
a marvelous job

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:35.748 align:middle line:84%
since that she has
really been the one

00:28:35.748 --> 00:28:40.186 align:middle line:84%
who have been representing
the feminine principle.

00:28:40.186 --> 00:28:49.261 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, not only
above the center but beneath

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:54.767 align:middle line:84%
that have been sin and shame,
and guilt, and everything.

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:58.003 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Magdalene is coming

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:00.639 align:middle line:90%
to relieve and heal us for that.

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:04.009 align:middle line:84%
Because her center
is the second heaven,

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:09.215 align:middle line:84%
the sacred center of
our etheric party.

00:29:09.215 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the time of
Jesus, the auric field

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:21.227 align:middle line:84%
or etheric the life field was
called "the rope of glory".

00:29:21.227 --> 00:29:23.629 align:middle line:90%
That was the name they gave it.

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:25.798 align:middle line:84%
And the name for this
chakras was the first heaven,

00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:28.434 align:middle line:84%
the second heaven, third
heaven, and the fourth heaven,

00:29:28.434 --> 00:29:31.871 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, to be in the
seventh heaven, you know?

00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:33.839 align:middle line:84%
Came from-- it really
come from there.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:38.244 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what we-- that's one
of the most important things

00:29:38.244 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that when Jesus are talking
about the bridal chamber,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.086 align:middle line:84%
how to unite with the feminine
and the masculine unites,

00:29:47.086 --> 00:29:49.955 align:middle line:84%
you have to go in
there in equality.

00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:54.393 align:middle line:84%
Only when you are equal
can you really unite them.

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:58.864 align:middle line:84%
And up until this day,
if you go to Israel,

00:29:58.864 --> 00:30:02.401 align:middle line:84%
you will hear all the rabbis
tell their congregation,

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:07.373 align:middle line:84%
all the married couples,
they really wanted them to go

00:30:07.373 --> 00:30:09.575 align:middle line:84%
into the bridal chamber
on the Sabbath

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:11.911 align:middle line:90%
and unite as often as possible.

00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:14.413 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's completely
different from what we learn

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:18.851 align:middle line:84%
in our church because they're
completely closed here.

00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:21.287 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to be
opened up again.

00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:25.257 align:middle line:84%
We have to be healed, all the--
the scars have to be healed.

00:30:25.257 --> 00:30:29.862 align:middle line:84%
And I think also one of the
main reasons why it has to be--

00:30:29.862 --> 00:30:31.797 align:middle line:90%
so, it's because we'll just look

00:30:31.797 --> 00:30:35.668 align:middle line:84%
at the society we're living
you can't buy any item

00:30:35.668 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:90%
without having some sexual--

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Connotation.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:30:42.074 --> 00:30:45.477 align:middle line:90%
If you buy a packet of matches,

00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:49.048 align:middle line:84%
you have to buy some boobies
too and stuff that like.

00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:53.819 align:middle line:84%
So, we are really living in a
pornographic society all over.

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:59.525 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us that there are
some very, very important things

00:30:59.525 --> 00:31:02.161 align:middle line:84%
that we have completely
misunderstood.

00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:07.366 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't really until
this day found out what to do

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:84%
with this as-- we
just know that this--

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:19.244 align:middle line:84%
we have a sexual drive and it's
such a strong power, you know?

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:22.815 align:middle line:84%
And we have to know how to
deal with it and see how it--

00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:27.119 align:middle line:84%
because sexuality and
spirituality are so connected.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.153 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:29.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And it's
the same energy, no?

00:31:29.288 --> 00:31:30.689 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:33.592 align:middle line:84%
We have just to have to-- and
it's so important that people

00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:37.162 align:middle line:84%
who know about all this,
educate younger people

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:40.399 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
have to do all this--

00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:84%
go through all the task
and stuff that we had.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.573 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
so much to that's--

00:31:47.573 --> 00:31:51.377 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a seventh
heaven for Christ sake.

00:31:51.377 --> 00:31:52.511 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And then, you
went on to "The Grail"?

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.416 align:middle line:84%
The third book, the
third portion,

00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:00.085 align:middle line:90%
the Grail, Le Gral?

00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yeah.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.189 align:middle line:84%
I've worked-- of course
together with this man.

00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:07.693 align:middle line:90%
He died in 2007.

00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, it really
opened up for me.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:17.403 align:middle line:84%
So, I started practicing myself
and worked with healing and also

00:32:17.403 --> 00:32:21.707 align:middle line:84%
to write a lot of the stuff that
came in on the Magdalene book

00:32:21.707 --> 00:32:24.043 align:middle line:90%
and also in the Grail book.

00:32:24.043 --> 00:32:29.648 align:middle line:84%
Still, I can open the books and
found places and think, "Wow,

00:32:29.648 --> 00:32:31.316 align:middle line:90%
where did that come from?

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.718 align:middle line:90%
Did I really write that?"

00:32:32.718 --> 00:32:37.156 align:middle line:84%
So, I understand now that-- you
know, when I finished the books,

00:32:37.156 --> 00:32:42.161 align:middle line:90%
the last word in Grail,

00:32:42.161 --> 00:32:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it was like somebody
pulled a rock underneath me.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.333 align:middle line:84%
For seven years, the time I
took to write those books,

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I was really, really--
I mean, the Darlings

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:52.738 align:middle line:90%
of the Gods, you know?

00:32:52.738 --> 00:32:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I could walk on water.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I was so-- I had so many
energy, so much energy.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.745 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, people came to me

00:32:59.745 --> 00:33:01.113 align:middle line:84%
for healing this
and healing that.

00:33:01.113 --> 00:33:04.149 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing happened.

00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:08.821 align:middle line:84%
But it was like as I--
that was something.

00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:12.324 align:middle line:84%
It was given to me while
I was writing this book

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:14.259 align:middle line:90%
because it was necessary.

00:33:14.259 --> 00:33:18.831 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, it was a
real, real, real hard some

00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:20.466 align:middle line:90%
of to me to come through this.

00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:24.002 align:middle line:84%
And there was a good friend of
mine who said, "Yes, because,

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:26.472 align:middle line:84%
you know, it isn't you
who wrote that book.

00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:30.742 align:middle line:84%
Maybe now it's time for you to
read them, to learn a little bit

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.277 align:middle line:90%
about what is in them."

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:34.313 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, only a
very good friend can say

00:33:34.313 --> 00:33:36.248 align:middle line:90%
that because I'm so...

00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But then, she was
right of course.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And yeah. But that
was really where my--

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:49.995 align:middle line:84%
everything started to get real
serious for me and really--

00:33:49.995 --> 00:33:54.867 align:middle line:84%
I'd really had to go through
a lot of things, cleansing.

00:33:54.867 --> 00:34:01.707 align:middle line:84%
I had my-- you know, heal
experience and all of that,

00:34:01.707 --> 00:34:06.145 align:middle line:84%
you know, a part of the shallow
thing that you have to clear up

00:34:06.145 --> 00:34:09.214 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has to
deal with in order

00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:10.716 align:middle line:90%
to really get connected.

00:34:10.716 --> 00:34:12.751 align:middle line:84%
So, that had been
my work ever since.

00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course now, I do
talks and stuffs, and work.

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And so, the
Grail part, tell us more

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:24.329 align:middle line:84%
about the lessons or the
things that are in there

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:27.633 align:middle line:84%
because it feels somehow
we're all in this kind of--

00:34:27.633 --> 00:34:31.036 align:middle line:84%
like grala,
the quest of the Grail?

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:32.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yes.

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:36.542 align:middle line:84%
When I was working with the seer
down in Montague, at one point

00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:38.876 align:middle line:84%
when we went up to
the mountain, he said,

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:43.448 align:middle line:84%
"I know that there have
been 12 women here inside

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.249 align:middle line:90%
this mountain."

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:48.353 align:middle line:84%
But everywhere we went and
we knew a lot of people

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:55.294 align:middle line:84%
in the village, they just
refuse to tell anything

00:34:55.294 --> 00:34:56.562 align:middle line:84%
and they said, "Oh,
you're crazy.

00:34:56.562 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing there."

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:07.339 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, in 1984, I
got a picture that's actually

00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:14.012 align:middle line:84%
in this book that found his
was at last in this book.

00:35:14.012 --> 00:35:18.984 align:middle line:84%
And I was here, that was when
I was in the music business.

00:35:18.984 --> 00:35:22.988 align:middle line:84%
I was after he in
London, recording

00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:25.991 align:middle line:90%
and the producer Niccolo he said

00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:29.761 align:middle line:84%
after days work, I was sitting
looking at the newspaper,

00:35:29.761 --> 00:35:33.265 align:middle line:84%
the adverts-- the
advertising in the back,

00:35:33.265 --> 00:35:36.268 align:middle line:84%
and there was this psychic
reading and he said,

00:35:36.268 --> 00:35:37.769 align:middle line:84%
"Have you ever had
a psychic reading?"

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:39.238 align:middle line:90%
"No." I said.

00:35:39.238 --> 00:35:41.506 align:middle line:84%
But I knew then that
I had to have one.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.709 align:middle line:84%
So I said, "That's
very good because just

00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:45.477 align:middle line:90%
around the corner there's the--

00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:84%
" I think it was the British
national psychic something.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:52.985 align:middle line:90%
So, I went in there.

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:55.821 align:middle line:84%
They have the Caloundra
Library on top.

00:35:55.821 --> 00:35:59.658 align:middle line:84%
And there was a cue of
businessman with bolos,

00:35:59.658 --> 00:36:03.362 align:middle line:84%
and there was punks, and
there was housewives.

00:36:03.362 --> 00:36:07.332 align:middle line:84%
And I think it cost something
of two pounds or something.

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:11.503 align:middle line:84%
So, I went in and I just
waited to have my reading.

00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:14.473 align:middle line:84%
They came, all those old
ladies that really looked like,

00:36:14.473 --> 00:36:16.041 align:middle line:90%
wow mediums, you know?

00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:20.679 align:middle line:84%
But the one I got was
a very young girl,

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:23.048 align:middle line:90%
almost my own age, you know?

00:36:23.048 --> 00:36:25.150 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know anything
where I came from.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:28.954 align:middle line:84%
So she just had my
watch and she sat down

00:36:28.954 --> 00:36:33.158 align:middle line:84%
and she started telling me
everything about myself.

00:36:33.158 --> 00:36:34.726 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:39.931 align:middle line:84%
So, she says, "You might
not believe it but in many--

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:44.202 align:middle line:84%
in years, you'll stop playing
music in the way you do now

00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.904 align:middle line:90%
and start working with healing.

00:36:45.904 --> 00:36:48.607 align:middle line:84%
And you'll meet some
very interesting people.

00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But there is one that
you should look out for.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.179 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Sylvia.

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:57.516 align:middle line:84%
She has something very
important to tell you, OK?"

00:36:57.516 --> 00:37:00.285 align:middle line:84%
So, when I came home,
I took my mother

00:37:00.285 --> 00:37:02.087 align:middle line:84%
because she has also
into this stuff.

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:05.991 align:middle line:84%
And every time we meet after
that, she said, "Oh, I--

00:37:05.991 --> 00:37:09.194 align:middle line:84%
we meet Sylvia," because
she thought that was my wife

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:15.133 align:middle line:84%
or something my-- so not
before many, many years after.

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:20.205 align:middle line:84%
In fact 30 years after when
Magdalene book came out,

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:29.281 align:middle line:84%
this picture I got in 1984 had
been following me all this time

00:37:30.649 --> 00:37:34.386 align:middle line:84%
and I forgot that it should be
part of this book of course.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:35.587 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you can see it.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:37:40.292 --> 00:37:42.627 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: But anyway, I just
managed to get the picture

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:47.499 align:middle line:84%
in the book without anything
just before it went into--

00:37:47.499 --> 00:37:48.867 align:middle line:90%
to finish.

00:37:48.867 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And when I went out for
lecturing and telling

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.574 align:middle line:84%
about the book, there was a
man, the first time I went

00:37:55.574 --> 00:37:59.311 align:middle line:84%
out to have a speech
of Mary Magdalene

00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:01.513 align:middle line:84%
and then he said,
"Listen the last."

00:38:01.513 --> 00:38:04.416 align:middle line:84%
In the back of the book
there's the speech of a woman.

00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:90%
"Who is she?

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.119 align:middle line:90%
And where did you get that?"

00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:08.587 align:middle line:90%
And I told him so and so.

00:38:08.587 --> 00:38:10.288 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Then, maybe
you should--

00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:13.325 align:middle line:84%
it will interest you to
know that it's my mother

00:38:13.325 --> 00:38:16.895 align:middle line:84%
who had brought the
picture to Denmark in 1959."

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:17.996 align:middle line:90%
"Oh," I said.

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:20.465 align:middle line:84%
"And I think really
you should meet her."

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:23.468 align:middle line:90%
And know what, that was Sylvia.

00:38:23.468 --> 00:38:25.904 align:middle line:84%
She was just waiting
there for me.

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:90%
And she was among priestess.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.877 align:middle line:84%
And it was just amazing when
she started telling her story

00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that she actually being part
of a movement that's still

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.987 align:middle line:84%
around called-- I think
it's a French movement

00:38:41.987 --> 00:38:46.892 align:middle line:84%
that you might know, the
movement of the word "Mother".

00:38:46.892 --> 00:38:48.527 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard of that?

00:38:48.527 --> 00:38:53.031 align:middle line:84%
And this picture that I just
showed you is actually a picture

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:56.101 align:middle line:84%
of word Mother, a
combination of Mother Mary

00:38:56.101 --> 00:38:57.803 align:middle line:90%
and Mary the Magdalene.

00:38:57.803 --> 00:39:00.772 align:middle line:90%
Wow, you know?

00:39:00.772 --> 00:39:07.279 align:middle line:84%
So-- And she told me that
when she was young, she was--

00:39:07.279 --> 00:39:13.819 align:middle line:84%
she became part of this
movement and she was called

00:39:13.819 --> 00:39:19.424 align:middle line:84%
down to Montague together with
11 other woman from the war

00:39:19.424 --> 00:39:22.661 align:middle line:84%
and they were initiated
inside the mountain.

00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:27.632 align:middle line:84%
And she escaped there,
exactly as the seer had told.

00:39:27.632 --> 00:39:36.341 align:middle line:84%
So, afterwards, those women were
taken out to the Cathar castles.

00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:38.877 align:middle line:84%
Every one of them had
to stay three days

00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:40.312 align:middle line:90%
in one of the castles.

00:39:40.312 --> 00:39:43.315 align:middle line:84%
But for Sylvia, there
was no castle.

00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:46.651 align:middle line:84%
She was the youngest
and she was taken

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:55.727 align:middle line:84%
to the Mary Magdalene
church of Rennes-le-Chateau.

00:39:56.862 --> 00:39:57.696 align:middle line:84%
Have you know-- do you
know Rennes-le-Chateau?

00:39:57.696 --> 00:39:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: I haven't been there.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: No, no.

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:03.101 align:middle line:84%
The Rennes-le-Chateau is a
very strong and famous place,

00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and the Mary Magdalene
church there indeed.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:11.443 align:middle line:84%
And that was where she got
the picture, from a priestess,

00:40:11.443 --> 00:40:14.379 align:middle line:84%
and that woman gave
her that picture.

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:17.349 align:middle line:84%
So, that was the
meeting in the Grail book

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:19.885 align:middle line:90%
that opened up for me really.

00:40:19.885 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:90%
She got-- became my teacher

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:30.195 align:middle line:84%
into the feminine part
of my path, you know?

00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:32.764 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It's interesting
just thinking

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:35.734 align:middle line:90%
of Magdalene and Mary together.

00:40:35.734 --> 00:40:36.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yes.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That it's
an instant healing.

00:40:38.537 --> 00:40:39.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: It is because--

00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:41.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Just thinking
of it and it's like--

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:42.541 align:middle line:90%
it's like all of a sudden,

00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:45.377 align:middle line:84%
it feels that ourselves
shift kind of thing.

00:40:45.377 --> 00:40:47.612 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
happened for me in the body just

00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:90%
when I thought of it, like--

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.714 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Yes, they go together.

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:50.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:51.917 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: They really
go together, that--

00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:53.585 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And it's like
the equation for unity.

00:40:53.585 --> 00:40:54.419 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Exactly.

00:40:54.419 --> 00:40:55.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:40:55.687 --> 00:40:58.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: So, Mary-- Mother
Mary, she's really done--

00:40:58.757 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:84%
still doing everyday
wonderful works, you know,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.632 align:middle line:84%
because helping people, healing
people, but it's like the dove.

00:41:07.632 --> 00:41:09.334 align:middle line:90%
You need the snake.

00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:12.337 align:middle line:84%
And that's the moon
priestess who come in there.

00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:14.439 align:middle line:84%
That's the Magdalene,
very strong.

00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:16.708 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, also
the Magdalene connects

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:22.514 align:middle line:84%
from the second heaven from the
sacral sender to the third eye.

00:41:22.514 --> 00:41:23.982 align:middle line:90%
And that's really what--

00:41:23.982 --> 00:41:28.587 align:middle line:84%
when you go in some of the
possibilities for a couple

00:41:28.587 --> 00:41:30.589 align:middle line:84%
when they go into
the bridal chamber

00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:33.258 align:middle line:90%
and knows about these things.

00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:39.965 align:middle line:84%
You know, when two people meet
and mate, they create something,

00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:48.573 align:middle line:84%
a third, something in the
etheric, a third gestalt.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:51.309 align:middle line:90%
And they really have to nurse

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:56.748 align:middle line:84%
that because that's a
kind of a child in a way.

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:03.755 align:middle line:84%
Something-- But when they mate,
they manifest the Shekhinah.

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:07.692 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're still are
doing within the Jewish world.

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:11.129 align:middle line:84%
They know that when they
go into the bridal chamber

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and go together, unite,
they manifest the Shekhinah

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.836 align:middle line:84%
which is the feminine
part of God.

00:42:17.836 --> 00:42:20.705 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's very
beautiful and something

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.707 align:middle line:84%
that we have completely
forgotten all

00:42:22.707 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:90%
about in our world.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:33.918 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the Jewish
Yeshua and Magdalene wisdom.

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:41.259 align:middle line:84%
So, when you go into the bridal
chamber, you have to be equal.

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:47.432 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, you
really try-- start to manifest.

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:52.971 align:middle line:84%
In the Aramaic psychology, it
said that when two people kiss

00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:57.609 align:middle line:84%
and embrace, the gates
of heaven are opened

00:42:57.609 --> 00:43:02.113 align:middle line:84%
and all the angels are
manifesting themselves

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:03.648 align:middle line:90%
around the couple.

00:43:03.648 --> 00:43:07.152 align:middle line:84%
So, that's also a way
of establishing love

00:43:07.152 --> 00:43:11.423 align:middle line:84%
in a very physical way
also when you do that.

00:43:11.423 --> 00:43:13.992 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's many
reasons for why you--

00:43:13.992 --> 00:43:19.831 align:middle line:84%
but you have to remember, you
shouldn't do it in the old kind

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:23.068 align:middle line:84%
of go-and-bang-it
your way, you know?

00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:25.370 align:middle line:90%
You really have to do it--

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:31.042 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be conscious
exactly of what you're doing.

00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:33.378 align:middle line:84%
Another important
thing, you know,

00:43:33.378 --> 00:43:35.046 align:middle line:90%
when you open the New Testament,

00:43:35.046 --> 00:43:40.452 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there's two
times that Mary Magdalene

00:43:40.452 --> 00:43:48.693 align:middle line:84%
and I think Jesus, and you know,
Messiah means the anointed one.

00:43:48.693 --> 00:43:51.996 align:middle line:84%
And Messiah is like
in Greece, Christ.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:54.332 align:middle line:90%
It means the anointed one.

00:43:54.332 --> 00:43:58.103 align:middle line:84%
So Christianity really
means the anointing party.

00:43:58.103 --> 00:44:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So, it should be the
most important thing

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.409 align:middle line:84%
in the anointing
parties' Holy Book

00:44:04.409 --> 00:44:09.781 align:middle line:84%
in New Testament those
instances was He anoint Him.

00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:11.750 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:13.218 align:middle line:90%
Nobody tells us.

00:44:13.218 --> 00:44:18.022 align:middle line:90%
If you go to the Jewish annuals

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:21.226 align:middle line:84%
and you start reading
right there,

00:44:21.226 --> 00:44:29.267 align:middle line:84%
you can see that only equal
person to that is going

00:44:29.267 --> 00:44:32.137 align:middle line:84%
to be anointed can
anoint that person.

00:44:32.137 --> 00:44:34.639 align:middle line:84%
You have to be equal to that
person that you are going

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:38.276 align:middle line:84%
to anoint or else you're
not allowed to do it.

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:44.015 align:middle line:84%
And if Jesus was Yeshua
Messiah, Jesus the Nazarene,

00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:50.555 align:middle line:84%
Jesus the Initiated, she had to
be an initiated person as well

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:52.857 align:middle line:90%
and not just as a simple whore.

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:55.994 align:middle line:90%
So, the word for whore

00:44:55.994 --> 00:44:59.664 align:middle line:84%
or prostitute is really the
word for moon priestess.

00:44:59.664 --> 00:45:03.201 align:middle line:84%
That means somebody has
insight into the sacral center

00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:06.671 align:middle line:84%
and the connections
through the third eye,

00:45:06.671 --> 00:45:09.774 align:middle line:84%
to the snake, the
Kundalini power.

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:11.509 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
what it's all about.

00:45:11.509 --> 00:45:15.046 align:middle line:84%
Remember that Jesus says in
the New Testament at one point,

00:45:15.046 --> 00:45:20.785 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Be wise as the
snake and pure as the dove."

00:45:20.785 --> 00:45:26.124 align:middle line:84%
And the dove is the
tree, upper, heavens,

00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and the snake is the
tree, lower ones.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.261 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:31.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Beautiful image.

00:45:31.029 --> 00:45:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: It is.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.198 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:45:33.198 --> 00:45:34.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Thank you.

00:45:34.032 --> 00:45:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.436 align:middle line:84%
I've-- We have enjoyed it
because I can speak for--

00:45:38.436 --> 00:45:40.338 align:middle line:84%
we have so much enjoyed
speaking with you.

00:45:40.338 --> 00:45:42.974 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
this delicious moment.

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:46.544 align:middle line:84%
Is there one last thing, you
know, last message or something

00:45:46.544 --> 00:45:51.115 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to leave
everybody watching with?

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:53.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Lars: You know,
Yeshua and Mary Magdalene,

00:45:53.485 --> 00:45:55.854 align:middle line:90%
they were also quantum physics.

00:45:55.854 --> 00:45:58.423 align:middle line:84%
They knew that everything
you send

00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:00.825 align:middle line:84%
out at one point will
come back to you.

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:03.328 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one
of the most important,

00:46:03.328 --> 00:46:05.897 align:middle line:90%
what you give is what you get.

00:46:05.897 --> 00:46:06.464 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:07.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:46:07.065 --> 00:46:07.799 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:07.799 --> 00:46:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Lars: Thank you.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.035 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And big, big kisses to
all juicy co-creators out there,

00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:13.938 align:middle line:84%
sending you much,
much love from London.

00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:15.306 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you soon.

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:16.741 align:middle line:84%
And don't hesitate to write
some comments [Background Music]

00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:19.677 align:middle line:84%
underneath and get the
conversation and juice flowing.

00:46:19.677 --> 00:46:21.946 align:middle line:84%
It's good to exchange
also beyond the interview.

00:46:21.946 --> 00:46:22.547 align:middle line:90%
Much love.

00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:25.516 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.
