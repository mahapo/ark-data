>> Lilou: Hello my
juicy co-creators,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.685 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here in Boulder Creek,
California in the middle

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.988 align:middle line:84%
of the redwoods at the HeartMath
Institute with you Howard.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:22.923 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to be
interviewing you today.

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:23.991 align:middle line:84%
>> Howard Martin:
Lilou, thank you so much.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.426 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad to have you
here as our guest,

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
and all the way from France.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.094 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:28.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh huh.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.866 align:middle line:84%
I just can't get enough of
those conversations, you know.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.701 align:middle line:90%
I think it's really inspiring.

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.069 align:middle line:90%
It's helping us to thrive.

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:38.372 align:middle line:84%
To really tap into our
potential, and of course,

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:40.474 align:middle line:84%
the heart is at the
center of it all,

00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:43.611 align:middle line:90%
and a big conversation to have.

00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.847 align:middle line:84%
I feel it, but I can't
explain is scientifically,

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:49.283 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very appreciative of
the work that you do here.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:52.887 align:middle line:84%
Could you, could you summarize
what happens here on the campus?

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:53.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Sure, well,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.089 align:middle line:84%
we're here at HeartMath,
as you mentioned.

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.492 align:middle line:90%
We've been around 23 years now.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:00:59.560 align:middle line:90%
And, we're the people that sort

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.061 align:middle line:84%
of put together a
new understanding

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:90%
of heart in a modern context.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.899 align:middle line:84%
You know, heart, we
know about heart.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.601 align:middle line:84%
It's been talked about
for thousands of years.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.737 align:middle line:84%
It's been revered as one
of the most important parts

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:12.873 align:middle line:84%
of humankind, and yet,
somehow it gets sort of lost

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:15.342 align:middle line:90%
in just philosophy and religion.

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:18.679 align:middle line:84%
And, hasn't made it always into
practical living application.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:19.879 align:middle line:90%
So, what we've done here

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.049 align:middle line:84%
at HeartMath all these
years is develop a system,

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.253 align:middle line:84%
consisting of methods,
techniques, and even technology,

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:28.856 align:middle line:84%
all underpinned with
modern scientific research.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.524 align:middle line:84%
So, we're the people
that really began

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.159 align:middle line:90%
to tell a new story of heart.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.295 align:middle line:84%
And, to do that,
we felt like, okay,

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:35.863 align:middle line:90%
if we don't do it differently,

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:37.598 align:middle line:84%
it will still be what
it's always been;

00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:39.567 align:middle line:84%
something that people
see as good.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:40.901 align:middle line:90%
They see it as sweet.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.937 align:middle line:84%
They see it as nice, but they
don't see it as practical.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:44.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And transformational.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And transformation,
that's right.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.474 align:middle line:84%
So, what we had to
do is we had to look

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:51.045 align:middle line:84%
at how we use modern tools
to begin to give new context

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:53.214 align:middle line:84%
to heart, so that people
can appreciate it more,

00:01:53.214 --> 00:01:54.682 align:middle line:90%
and apply it in their life.

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
We chose science as that bridge.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.486 align:middle line:84%
Our science was never intended
to take the heart out of heart.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.255 align:middle line:84%
We're not trying to make
it sterile or mental,

00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.357 align:middle line:84%
but we knew it needed
a connection.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:04.558 align:middle line:84%
So, what our scientists
have done

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:07.094 align:middle line:84%
over these years is really
tell an amazing story,

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:08.361 align:middle line:84%
starting with the
physical heart,

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.397 align:middle line:84%
about how it's more
than a blood pump.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:13.567 align:middle line:84%
It's really an information
processing center in our bodies,

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.703 align:middle line:84%
communicating powerful
messages to the brain

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:17.972 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the entire
system, and they've mapped

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.241 align:middle line:84%
out how it does all that, and
they've shown very clearly

00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.743 align:middle line:84%
through published peer
reviewed scientific resource

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:25.812 align:middle line:84%
that it does do a lot
more than pump blood.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:28.549 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, we all know
about the spiritual heart.

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.654 align:middle line:84%
And, to me, it's that
part of us where spirit;

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.788 align:middle line:84%
something that's larger than
our ordinary self begins

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.358 align:middle line:90%
to merge with our humanness.

00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:39.326 align:middle line:84%
It's that part of
ourselves that allows us

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.128 align:middle line:90%
to move beyond our mediocrity.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Gives us the power
to do the things

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.698 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes we
think we can't.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:46.967 align:middle line:84%
It's the source of
our self-security.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.401 align:middle line:90%
It's the source of our wisdom.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.236 align:middle line:90%
It's high speed.

00:02:49.236 --> 00:02:50.638 align:middle line:90%
It's intuitive.

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:53.173 align:middle line:84%
It gives us new clarity and new
understanding about ourselves,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.409 align:middle line:84%
about each other,
and about life.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And, one of the thing
that I've learned

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.745 align:middle line:90%
about heart all these years,

00:02:57.745 --> 00:03:00.547 align:middle line:84%
is that it's really
my own best friend,

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:04.285 align:middle line:84%
and my most reliable guide that
I have to making the decisions,

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:08.589 align:middle line:84%
big ones or small ones, that I
need to make as I navigate life.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.358 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, of course,
I want to ask you how tap

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.161 align:middle line:84%
in this power, and how we
can live a life-centered,

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
heart-centered life, but
what are some of the,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.903 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific part,
what are some of the,

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:25.973 align:middle line:84%
because we hear a lot of the
coherence of the heart, huh?

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:26.807 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:28.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: It's a term, yeah.

00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we found was, and
it wasn't just our research.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.878 align:middle line:90%
This is what was interesting is

00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.279 align:middle line:84%
that the research
was scattered all

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
through the research literature.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.682 align:middle line:90%
You know, the story was there,

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:37.785 align:middle line:84%
but nobody had connected the
dots and put it together.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.687 align:middle line:84%
And, what we found
was that the heart

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:84%
at a physical level communicated
to us in four different ways.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a neurological
communication.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.895 align:middle line:90%
This was interesting.

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole field
called neurocardiology.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Who knew? Studying this
very complex nervous system

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:84%
that we have in the
physical heart.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:57.671 align:middle line:84%
Next to the brain is
the most complex part

00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.038 align:middle line:84%
of our nervous system
that we have,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.308 align:middle line:84%
and that little nervous
system communicates

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
with the big brain here
through a nerve pathway

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.878 align:middle line:90%
that starts out in our heart.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.114 align:middle line:84%
It goes up, it comes
in through the brain,

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:09.016 align:middle line:84%
all the way through the
lower brain centers,

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:10.384 align:middle line:84%
in through the midbrain,
where a lot

00:04:10.384 --> 00:04:12.019 align:middle line:84%
of our emotional
processing occurs,

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.155 align:middle line:84%
and then terminates all the
way here in the neocortex;

00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:17.725 align:middle line:84%
higher perceptual
centers of our brain.

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:20.994 align:middle line:84%
And, when researchers map
out the neurological traffic

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:24.164 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, they see that
the heart is actually sending a

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:25.399 align:middle line:90%
whole lot of more information

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.201 align:middle line:84%
than it ever received
from the brain.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a neurological
communication studies

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.339 align:middle line:84%
through a field called
neurocardiology.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.674 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
they discovered is

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
that we have what's called
the blood pressure wave.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.479 align:middle line:84%
It means that when the heart
squeezes and pushes blood,

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a wave of energy
that's pushing that blood

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:84%
through the veins
and the arteries,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.585 align:middle line:84%
and it goes through
obviously the whole body.

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.488 align:middle line:84%
Blood pressure waves, it
turns out, influence all kinds

00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
of biological function,
including the brain.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.827 align:middle line:84%
The electrical activity in our
brain is actually synchronized

00:04:53.827 --> 00:04:56.263 align:middle line:84%
to changes occurring in
this blood pressure wave.

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And, that's called a biophysical
form of communication.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.769 align:middle line:90%
The third way is biochemical.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:04.238 align:middle line:84%
This is another one of those
who knew kind of things.

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.040 align:middle line:84%
In 1983, the heart was
actually reclassified

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.842 align:middle line:90%
as part of hormonal system.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:11.779 align:middle line:84%
The reason was is they
discovered it produces several

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.514 align:middle line:90%
very, very important hormones.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.917 align:middle line:84%
One of those, for example,
is called atriopeptide.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:19.086 align:middle line:84%
Atriopeptide has
an interesting job.

00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:21.455 align:middle line:84%
It reduces or mediates
the release

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.791 align:middle line:90%
of the stress hormone, cortisol.

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It produces another hormone,
which many of listeners

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.397 align:middle line:84%
and viewers today have probably
heard of called oxytocin,

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:32.966 align:middle line:84%
which has been generically
called the love hormone.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.334 align:middle line:90%
Researches now are seeing

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.404 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is probably the
biggest producer of oxytocin

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:42.009 align:middle line:84%
in our body, and that's a
biochemical communication.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.544 align:middle line:84%
So, these first three
ways are interesting,

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:45.345 align:middle line:84%
and they're well-documented,
well-studied,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.315 align:middle line:84%
and I call them hardwired
biological

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.651 align:middle line:90%
communication pathways.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.152 align:middle line:84%
The fourth way is where
it gets really cool

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:53.387 align:middle line:90%
and more interesting to me.

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle line:90%
It's the energetic heart.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.025 align:middle line:84%
You see, our heart is
actually an electrical organ.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.494 align:middle line:84%
If you or I go to the doctor,
the doctor says I'm going

00:06:00.494 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
to do your EKG now
or ECG they call it.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.565 align:middle line:84%
They put electrodes
around our chest,

00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:06.467 align:middle line:84%
and they get an electrical
signal

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:09.036 align:middle line:84%
from the electricity being
produced by the heart,

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.905 align:middle line:84%
and they determine something
about our physical health.

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:13.774 align:middle line:84%
The heart is by far
the strongest source

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:18.612 align:middle line:84%
of bioelectricity that we
have, 40-60 times more powerful

00:06:18.612 --> 00:06:21.915 align:middle line:84%
than the second most powerful
source, which is the brain.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.051 align:middle line:84%
So, this electrical energy
produced by the heart goes

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.452 align:middle line:84%
to every single cell
in our body.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:28.522 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where
it becomes more fun.

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:32.059 align:middle line:84%
That signal is strong enough, it
creates an electromagnetic field

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:34.962 align:middle line:84%
that goes out about
3-4 feet from the body,

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:37.097 align:middle line:90%
surrounds us in 360 degrees.

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.966 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you and
I are interfacing

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:40.601 align:middle line:90%
at an electromagnetic level

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.337 align:middle line:84%
from the electromagnetic
fields produced by our heart,

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:46.907 align:middle line:84%
so it's radiates beyond
the skin out into space.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.776 align:middle line:84%
Now, that field changes
all the time.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:52.346 align:middle line:84%
The electrical energy in
the field will change.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And, you know what's
changing it?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.848 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions.

00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:57.618 align:middle line:84%
And what we're feeling
emotionally is determining what

00:06:57.618 --> 00:06:59.553 align:middle line:90%
frequencies are in that field.

00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:02.556 align:middle line:84%
If we're feeling frustrated
or angry, resentful,

00:07:02.556 --> 00:07:03.757 align:middle line:90%
those kind of feelings,

00:07:03.757 --> 00:07:06.026 align:middle line:84%
it produces what's called
an incoherent spectra,

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:07.961 align:middle line:90%
chaotic field.

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:13.367 align:middle line:84%
If we're feeling love, care,
compassion, appreciation,

00:07:13.367 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
those heart qualities that we've
all heard about our whole life,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.873 align:middle line:84%
the field becomes more
coherent and very ordered.

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.008 align:middle line:90%
So, literally,

00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:23.043 align:middle line:84%
we are broadcasting this
information all the time

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.813 align:middle line:84%
from our heart to every cell
in our body out into space,

00:07:26.813 --> 00:07:29.516 align:middle line:84%
and we're interfacing and
interacting with each other.

00:07:29.516 --> 00:07:30.517 align:middle line:90%
Now, this.

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:31.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: So, that means

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.622 align:middle line:84%
that information is constantly
being given from heart to heart.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:38.492 align:middle line:84%
Like right now, beyond the
words, there's something else

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that is happening
here between us.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Absolutely there is.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.332 align:middle line:84%
And, when you then, that's
just electromagnetic energy,

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.935 align:middle line:84%
which is very reliable
and easy to measure.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
When you now begin to look
at it through the lens

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.240 align:middle line:84%
of let's say quantum physics,
which removes the barriers

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.976 align:middle line:84%
and time and space that
Newtonian physics has.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.412 align:middle line:84%
Then this field becomes
very, very large,

00:07:58.412 --> 00:07:59.746 align:middle line:90%
maybe even infinite in a way.

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle line:84%
It could be influencing and
connecting with things far,

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:84%
far beyond our time and
space understanding.

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.821 align:middle line:84%
So, it's my belief that
we, that through all

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.457 align:middle line:84%
of this communication,
biological, electromagnetic,

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
all the other energetic fields
that are probably associated

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.463 align:middle line:84%
with heart, that's where we are
actually accessing the field

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:17.798 align:middle line:90%
of the consciousness.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:21.034 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness meaning that
infinite field of information

00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.170 align:middle line:84%
that we draw from
to create reality,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle line:84%
whatever reality
happens to be for us

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.406 align:middle line:90%
through our human filters.

00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:28.842 align:middle line:84%
And, it's through heart where
we make that connection.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.811 align:middle line:84%
It's transmitted at
super-high speed to the brain.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.348 align:middle line:84%
The brain has this amazing
information processing center

00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.416 align:middle line:84%
that we have that
interprets and compares,

00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:39.186 align:middle line:84%
and compartmentalizes
things, and so it looks

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.287 align:middle line:90%
like the brain is doing it all.

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.421 align:middle line:84%
But, my belief is
they work together,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.624 align:middle line:90%
and that the information

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:46.059 align:middle line:84%
from consciousness enters
the biological system

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:47.361 align:middle line:90%
at the level of heart.

00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:48.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I have a
question regarding that,

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.832 align:middle line:84%
because I had the honor to
interview Pim van Lommel,

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:55.469 align:middle line:84%
you know, the cardiologue
that is based in New Zealand

00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:59.039 align:middle line:84%
that who have studies and
had many, many heart arrests

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:03.143 align:middle line:84%
in front of him, and yet
those people were able

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:06.613 align:middle line:84%
to experience an NDE, so
how do you explain that?

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:08.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: What's an NDE?

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: No, how do you
explain the fact, yeah,

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:11.218 align:middle line:90%
near death experience.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:14.888 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the people
would say, you know, oh, well,

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.223 align:middle line:90%
you can't have an NDE.

00:09:16.223 --> 00:09:19.226 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's the heart,
is it created by the brain,

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.429 align:middle line:84%
but here you're saying
consciousness is accessed

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:23.563 align:middle line:90%
through the heart, right?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm wondering how
that works with NDE's.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I don't
know, it's hard to say.

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:29.336 align:middle line:84%
It's a question I've
never been asked before.

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:32.039 align:middle line:84%
I mean that what I was saying
earlier is that, you know,

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.541 align:middle line:84%
consciousness enters our
system in a variety of ways.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:37.944 align:middle line:84%
I think what the heart is
is really a bioreceptor

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:41.148 align:middle line:84%
of intuitive information,
and that's what's happening.

00:09:41.148 --> 00:09:43.817 align:middle line:84%
So, in a near-death experience,
when people leave the body,

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:46.186 align:middle line:84%
they go someplace else, they
experience something different.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.188 align:middle line:84%
You know, time becomes
very different.

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:49.956 align:middle line:84%
They can feel like they
were there a long time,

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.258 align:middle line:84%
and it's been a matter
of minutes

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:55.162 align:middle line:84%
that they were pronounced
dead, etc. It's just hard

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:57.998 align:middle line:84%
to say how the heart and
brain, either one play

00:09:57.998 --> 00:09:59.332 align:middle line:90%
into that particular situation.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:02.502 align:middle line:84%
I haven't ever studied that,
and I've talked to people

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:90%
who have had that experience.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.772 align:middle line:84%
So, I know that they've
been very real with me

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.274 align:middle line:84%
about what they've
said about it.

00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:08.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: They had that
unconditional love,

00:10:08.842 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and they felt all those.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And they really
didn't want to come back.

00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.446 align:middle line:90%
It was a service to come back.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:15.115 align:middle line:84%
It was like, we fear death,
and the ones that I've talked

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.483 align:middle line:84%
to have said, you
know, you're there,

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:21.088 align:middle line:84%
and it's really a choice you
make to come back, because it's

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:26.326 align:middle line:84%
so freeing and so magnificent,
that it's beyond the density

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:28.328 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
here on earth.

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:30.997 align:middle line:84%
So, they have to make choices
about even wanting to come back,

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:32.432 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually a
choice of service,

00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.334 align:middle line:84%
that they recognize
there's more work to do

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:37.304 align:middle line:84%
in assisting this
world and humanity

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.172 align:middle line:90%
through a transitional time.

00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:40.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So, sorry I
stopped in your explanation,

00:10:40.907 --> 00:10:44.244 align:middle line:84%
but I got really excited,
because you said this is a way

00:10:44.244 --> 00:10:46.413 align:middle line:84%
for us to access
other dimensions,

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.981 align:middle line:90%
even our actually consciousness.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:48.982 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:50.283 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what's
happening anyway

00:10:50.283 --> 00:10:53.186 align:middle line:84%
and the more loving we are
and the more caring we are,

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:55.288 align:middle line:84%
these things, the
more receptive we are.

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:57.491 align:middle line:90%
The more this field is coherent,

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.126 align:middle line:84%
and a coherent field
will receive more

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:00.394 align:middle line:90%
of that information.

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:02.195 align:middle line:84%
So, it goes right back to
some basic stuff in life

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:04.731 align:middle line:84%
that we all know that we
just need to practice more.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:07.734 align:middle line:84%
We need to appreciate all the
things we have in our life.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:09.536 align:middle line:84%
We need to be more
caring towards other.

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:12.372 align:middle line:84%
We need to be more compassionate
and less judgmental.

00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:13.607 align:middle line:90%
We need to have more love.

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:15.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe the
purpose of life is to love.

00:11:15.442 --> 00:11:16.676 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds simplistic.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.011 align:middle line:90%
I know it sounds philosophical.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.279 align:middle line:90%
Hey, life's tough out there.

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:22.149 align:middle line:84%
You don't understand all
that, but the more I do this,

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.618 align:middle line:84%
and the older that I get, the
more I recognize that I believe

00:11:24.618 --> 00:11:25.886 align:middle line:90%
that that's the purpose.

00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:27.087 align:middle line:90%
Is to love.

00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:29.923 align:middle line:84%
It's the universal, you
know, source of creation.

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:31.892 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Fabric
of the universe.

00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Fabric of the
universe, and our ability

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.662 align:middle line:84%
to put more of that out, and
to push past the barriers

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.364 align:middle line:84%
and thresholds where
we stop doing it,

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.233 align:middle line:84%
where we have the resistances
and the judgments and things.

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:41.568 align:middle line:90%
That's the real work.

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.603 align:middle line:84%
The more we do of that, and
that's a heart kind of work

00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:47.773 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, the more we begin
to then receive new information

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:90%
that allows us to be more aware,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.545 align:middle line:84%
more conscious, more
intelligent.

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:54.447 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, it comes back
to the manifestation

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.583 align:middle line:84%
of these heart qualities
in a practical way,

00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:59.419 align:middle line:84%
taken out of sentimental
associations,

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:01.988 align:middle line:84%
applied in our daily lives,
and how we make choices

00:12:01.988 --> 00:12:04.591 align:middle line:84%
and how we interact with
others is really how we come

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:08.161 align:middle line:84%
into the new intelligence,
that we are coming into anyway,

00:12:08.161 --> 00:12:12.365 align:middle line:84%
but that we need to begin the
solve the personal, societal,

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:14.267 align:middle line:84%
and global problems
we have today.

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:18.572 align:middle line:84%
It still comes to accessing
more of the frequency of love.

00:12:18.572 --> 00:12:22.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And this is something
you think our whole society can

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.211 align:middle line:90%
be a heart-based society?

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:25.512 align:middle line:90%
Can we get there?

00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah,
that's what we do here.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.448 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're trying to, you
asked the question earlier,

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:29.916 align:middle line:90%
what do we do here at HeartMath?

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.519 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're really trying to
create a more heart-based world,

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and we do that again
in a variety

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.022 align:middle line:90%
of different ways to do that.

00:12:36.022 --> 00:12:38.525 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I think that
part of this era that we're

00:12:38.525 --> 00:12:40.627 align:middle line:84%
in now that's been
generically called the shift.

00:12:40.627 --> 00:12:42.429 align:middle line:90%
An important part of that is

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.698 align:middle line:84%
that heart-directed
living is part

00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:46.766 align:middle line:90%
of the evolutionary imperative.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.401 align:middle line:84%
That's not HeartMath
by any means.

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's way bigger than HeartMath.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.439 align:middle line:84%
We've just been pretty good
at putting language around,

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:54.307 align:middle line:84%
some simple tools,
some simple techniques,

00:12:54.307 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
some things that people can
then apply in their life

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.245 align:middle line:84%
to create this heart-based
world,

00:12:58.245 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
but it's much bigger than that.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.649 align:middle line:90%
We call it heart intelligence,

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:06.386 align:middle line:84%
a high-speed intuitive
intelligence that manifests

00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.088 align:middle line:90%
from our authentic self.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:10.156 align:middle line:90%
And, as we have more of that,

00:13:10.156 --> 00:13:11.892 align:middle line:84%
I think we are moving
that way anyway.

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:14.494 align:middle line:84%
I feel like things are in a
good place within the context

00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:16.496 align:middle line:90%
of the evolutionary shift.

00:13:16.496 --> 00:13:17.898 align:middle line:90%
It is a dimensional shift.

00:13:17.898 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a change in the
consciousness fabric itself.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:25.272 align:middle line:84%
Our mutual friend, Barbara Marx
Hubbard, calls it a memetic,

00:13:25.272 --> 00:13:27.741 align:middle line:90%
change in the memetic code.

00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:32.078 align:middle line:84%
A meme is a mass thought
form, so to speak,

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.481 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even question,
you know, it's so big.

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't even see it, it's
so big, like big is better,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.485 align:middle line:90%
you know, those kinds of things.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:39.619 align:middle line:90%
They're just sort of build

00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.288 align:middle line:84%
into the psychological
framework that we have.

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:42.222 align:middle line:90%
We don't even challenge them.

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.623 align:middle line:90%
They're just there.

00:13:43.623 --> 00:13:48.161 align:middle line:84%
But, what she says is just like
the genetic code is changing,

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:51.131 align:middle line:84%
that the memetic code of
consciousness is changing.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.465 align:middle line:84%
I believe she's right
about that.

00:13:52.465 --> 00:13:55.235 align:middle line:84%
I think what we are involving
now is a dimensional shift

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest shift that
there's been since there's been,

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:02.008 align:middle line:84%
you know, human beings
on the planet.

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.844 align:middle line:84%
We're moving from a baseline of
third dimensional consciousness,

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:09.382 align:middle line:84%
which is, I mean, it's
okay, it's separate,

00:14:09.382 --> 00:14:10.951 align:middle line:90%
it's good, bad, right and wrong.

00:14:10.951 --> 00:14:12.085 align:middle line:90%
It's ambition.

00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:12.886 align:middle line:90%
It's survival.

00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It's those kinds of things,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.522 align:middle line:84%
but look at the beauty
that it's built.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.224 align:middle line:84%
So, it's not to say
that it's all bad.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.993 align:middle line:84%
But, we're moving now
into the fourth dimension,

00:14:19.993 --> 00:14:21.394 align:middle line:84%
and where we're trying
to get to,

00:14:21.394 --> 00:14:24.531 align:middle line:84%
and we are getting there very
quickly is to the higher ranges

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.068 align:middle line:84%
So, what's happening is we're
really making a dimension

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:31.905 align:middle line:84%
and a half shift over a
very short period of time.

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:34.541 align:middle line:84%
I estimate, you know,
about a hundred years,

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're in the
middle of it right now.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.279 align:middle line:84%
About a hundred year
little window of time,

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.381 align:middle line:84%
we're making this huge
dimensional shift.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.616 align:middle line:90%
Well, that much change happening

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.753 align:middle line:84%
so quickly creates a
huge amount of chaos.

00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:47.487 align:middle line:90%
We see that.

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:48.288 align:middle line:90%
We see the wars.

00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle line:90%
We see the social inequity.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.091 align:middle line:90%
We see the economic issues.

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
We see all those things, and
they're displayed so prominently

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.565 align:middle line:84%
to us, and all we have to do
is look at a news site or turn

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
on the TV, and it's like,
I can't believe this.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.036 align:middle line:84%
You know, we see those
pictures so vividly.

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:06.806 align:middle line:84%
What I think we want to also
recognize is all the other

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:09.309 align:middle line:84%
changes that are happening
that are all the other changes

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.578 align:middle line:84%
that are happening that are
really positive and really good,

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.279 align:middle line:84%
and that they are happening
very quickly as well.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.248 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions
and millions of people,

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:16.716 align:middle line:84%
and you know this
just as well as I do,

00:15:16.716 --> 00:15:19.853 align:middle line:84%
all around the world are
operating in new states

00:15:19.853 --> 00:15:21.588 align:middle line:90%
of awareness and consciousness.

00:15:21.588 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They've developed new
values, new interest,

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.826 align:middle line:84%
new ways of living, new
levels of cooperation,

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.294 align:middle line:90%
new levels of making an effort

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.397 align:middle line:84%
to not separate,
but rather unite.

00:15:30.397 --> 00:15:33.299 align:middle line:84%
All those things are
happening all over the planet,

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:36.269 align:middle line:84%
so we are moving to a
more heart-based world.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:37.604 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, people
are going to get it.

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:39.506 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean everybody will.

00:15:39.506 --> 00:15:41.508 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be practical
about these things.

00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:43.276 align:middle line:84%
There are people who will
never believe in this.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:46.546 align:middle line:84%
People that don't
want to live that way.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:48.848 align:middle line:90%
It's not how they see the world.

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:50.216 align:middle line:90%
It's not their world view.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:52.252 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, there
are millions and millions

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and millions, like I've
said around the world

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.422 align:middle line:90%
who are seeing that way.

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:57.824 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're calling
it heart-based world,

00:15:57.824 --> 00:16:00.527 align:middle line:84%
but they're manifesting
the qualities of heart.

00:16:00.527 --> 00:16:03.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Should could there
be actually two different

00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:06.232 align:middle line:84%
societies, or like a new
earth on the same earth,

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:08.501 align:middle line:84%
and two different kind of
current, one based on fear,

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:09.502 align:middle line:90%
the other one on love?

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:10.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I think
it already exists.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:11.471 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.374 align:middle line:84%
That seems deeper
the bigger it gets.

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:17.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: The polarization
is becoming more obvious.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.978 align:middle line:84%
You know, what I see,
just a visual image of it,

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.014 align:middle line:84%
I see a new world birthing
itself in the middle

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
of the old one, and it's push
out like this as it grows.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.185 align:middle line:84%
And, the old one
is pushing back,

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
want to go away.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.055 align:middle line:84%
Where the two meet,
there's friction,

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:31.491 align:middle line:84%
and that friction is
what we see on the news,

00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
but the new one is emerging,
and it can't be stopped.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.062 align:middle line:84%
It's like, this shift
is bigger than us.

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:37.197 align:middle line:90%
It's bigger than humanity.

00:16:37.197 --> 00:16:38.431 align:middle line:90%
It's bigger than planet earth.

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:40.667 align:middle line:84%
It's a big, big shift that's
happening throughout the

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:42.168 align:middle line:90%
cosmos really.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.104 align:middle line:90%
So, it's a matter not of if.

00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:47.173 align:middle line:84%
It's a matter of how easy
or how hard do we make it.

00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:50.343 align:middle line:84%
So, part of what we do here
at HeartMath is provide people

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.479 align:middle line:84%
with the skills they
need to make it a kinder,

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:54.681 align:middle line:90%
gentler process, and then

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:57.817 align:middle line:84%
to help others make it a
kinder, gentler process.

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:59.252 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going
to happen anyway.

00:16:59.252 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.288 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
how rough it's going

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:90%
to be to get it there.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.724 align:middle line:90%
But, there are two worlds

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:06.259 align:middle line:84%
in a sense operating
in the same place.

00:17:06.259 --> 00:17:07.627 align:middle line:90%
I've wondered about that.

00:17:07.627 --> 00:17:12.698 align:middle line:84%
When I think about something
like how society operates here

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.336 align:middle line:84%
in the western world, and
my values or all the people

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:18.037 align:middle line:84%
that I'm associated
with on base,

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:24.344 align:middle line:84%
and I how people could
have a genocidal war,

00:17:24.344 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:90%
let's say in Subsahara Africa,

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.181 align:middle line:84%
and the horrific
things that go on there.

00:17:28.181 --> 00:17:31.484 align:middle line:90%
Is that the same planet I'm on?

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:33.686 align:middle line:84%
And, I'm not saying
that from a judgment

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:34.788 align:middle line:90%
of those people or anything.

00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:36.189 align:middle line:84%
It's just like it's
two different worlds.

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.191 align:middle line:84%
I mean to be able
to do those things

00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle line:84%
to each other is beyond
anything comprehensible in me

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
or anything around me.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And it's not the
heart doesn't see it, right?

00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:48.535 align:middle line:90%
When you have this heart-based,

00:17:48.535 --> 00:17:50.904 align:middle line:84%
heart intelligence,
you see that reality.

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.807 align:middle line:84%
You see the suffering,
but how do you.

00:17:53.807 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But, it seems like it gives
actually even more strength.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.646 align:middle line:84%
The heart actually
seems to [noise].

00:17:59.646 --> 00:18:01.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, well, you
know there's a lower aspect

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and higher aspect of heart,
and the lower aspect is

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
like the different between let's
say compassion and sympathy.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah.

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:10.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Sympathy
is oh the poor people,

00:18:10.356 --> 00:18:12.659 align:middle line:84%
and it sort of has this
draggy energy to it.

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:16.162 align:middle line:84%
It feels like it's bringing
your down, with all this worry

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:17.664 align:middle line:90%
and concern and everything.

00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:19.165 align:middle line:84%
Compassion would
be a higher place

00:18:19.165 --> 00:18:21.568 align:middle line:84%
of really having
an understanding

00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.303 align:middle line:84%
of what these people are
going through; feeling it,

00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:25.305 align:middle line:90%
but not being immersed in it.

00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:27.974 align:middle line:84%
And, in that higher
compassion, the energetic output

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.876 align:middle line:90%
of service is much more potent.

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:32.111 align:middle line:84%
Sympathy has got a draggy
kind of energy to it.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:35.014 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the same
level of effectiveness

00:18:35.014 --> 00:18:36.616 align:middle line:90%
that real compassion does.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:38.418 align:middle line:84%
So, the deeper we
are in our own heart,

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the more we make connection
with that heart intelligence

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.357 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves, the more
self-secure we are

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:84%
to be able make choices about
how compassionate we should be

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:51.164 align:middle line:84%
about something,
versus how sympathetic.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:55.401 align:middle line:84%
Those discriminations are
part of an intelligence

00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:58.204 align:middle line:84%
that gives us the ability to see
more into ourselves and to see

00:18:58.204 --> 00:18:59.472 align:middle line:90%
into each other, and that's one

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:00.807 align:middle line:84%
of the beautiful
things about heart.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.076 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Um hum, um hum,
and there is this oneness,

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:05.178 align:middle line:84%
because that's a big
conversation, right?

00:19:05.178 --> 00:19:09.148 align:middle line:84%
Seeing that we are the
same, yet we are different.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:11.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: True, it's
allowing for the individuality.

00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:14.787 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it's beginning
to see the commonality.

00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:16.389 align:middle line:84%
An example that gets
talked about a lot

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:19.626 align:middle line:84%
in various circles is
we're moving from an era

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:22.195 align:middle line:84%
of competition to an
era of cooperation.

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:25.231 align:middle line:84%
Right? That's said a lot in the
business circles and things, so,

00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
what that means is we're
trying to be less separate.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.769 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to be more
accepting of each other.

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:32.705 align:middle line:84%
Allowing for the uniqueness,
not trying to take that away

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:34.841 align:middle line:84%
from someone or make
them like you.

00:19:34.841 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, maybe
I'm not like them.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.679 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I don't even agree with
them totally, but I can sort

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
of appreciate what they are,
maybe how they got there.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.519 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I see breaking
down, this will relate to you

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.021 align:middle line:84%
and I right now is
age difference.

00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:49.422 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem to matter.

00:19:49.422 --> 00:19:53.126 align:middle line:84%
You know, what's been exciting
to me in the last say 10 years

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:55.328 align:middle line:84%
or so as I've traveled
around the world,

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:57.730 align:middle line:84%
as I run into these people
that are much younger than me

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.433 align:middle line:84%
that never went through all the
various things that I had to go

00:20:00.433 --> 00:20:03.469 align:middle line:84%
through to manifest
whatever I have today.

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But, they are showing the
behaviors without having gone

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.841 align:middle line:90%
through the same stuff, right?

00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:09.909 align:middle line:90%
They're younger.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:11.044 align:middle line:84%
They haven't gone
into all these things.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.378 align:middle line:84%
They haven't read all
these spiritual books

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:14.614 align:middle line:84%
and spent all this time
meditating and all that.

00:20:14.614 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there's flexibility
and a flow that they have.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.752 align:middle line:84%
There's an awareness and
a brightness about them,

00:20:19.752 --> 00:20:23.356 align:middle line:84%
and I recognize that they
didn't get there the same way,

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:25.058 align:middle line:90%
but it's showing up anyway.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:26.959 align:middle line:90%
China was a good example for me.

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.528 align:middle line:84%
You know the people that
I deal with in China,

00:20:28.528 --> 00:20:29.696 align:middle line:90%
they're young, they're vibrant.

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:33.032 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
who Deepak Chopra is.

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.233 align:middle line:84%
You know, they haven't
been exposed

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.135 align:middle line:84%
to that whole world
and those teachings.

00:20:36.135 --> 00:20:40.006 align:middle line:84%
They don't know about all that
stuff, and yet they have a care.

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:43.276 align:middle line:84%
Their attention to me when I'm
there is like extraordinary.

00:20:43.276 --> 00:20:45.678 align:middle line:84%
The level of attention
and care and sensitivity

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:48.548 align:middle line:84%
that they manifest that I
can see and feel from them is

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:50.817 align:middle line:84%
so tangible and real, and
I look at that and go,

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.085 align:middle line:84%
there's something
else going on here.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.219 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you studied.

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:55.288 align:middle line:90%
It's accessing that field

00:20:55.288 --> 00:20:58.725 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that's changing
what's available to us today,

00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:01.294 align:middle line:84%
and again, I'll go back and
you know, repeat myself,

00:21:01.294 --> 00:21:03.863 align:middle line:84%
but you access it by
putting out more love.

00:21:03.863 --> 00:21:08.001 align:middle line:84%
It's a heart-related connection
that gives us access to them.

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:09.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: A lot of
the mystics speak

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:11.838 align:middle line:84%
of this special place
in the heart.

00:21:11.838 --> 00:21:14.374 align:middle line:90%
Are you able to study that?

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:15.508 align:middle line:90%
What's this thing?

00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:16.876 align:middle line:90%
How's it called already?

00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:18.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Well, I'm not sure.

00:21:18.077 --> 00:21:18.878 align:middle line:90%
There's so many.

00:21:18.878 --> 00:21:19.946 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: A little name.

00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: A chamber
for it in the heart

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.415 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle line:84%
And, there's been talk about
heart crystals in the heart

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:25.585 align:middle line:90%
and lots of things like that.

00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Research bears out, you know,

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.255 align:middle line:84%
I think what our research
has done has shown

00:21:29.255 --> 00:21:31.624 align:middle line:84%
that there's relevance to
those things that were said

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.426 align:middle line:84%
in different ways
and different words.

00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:37.463 align:middle line:84%
You know, that there is a
special place inside the heart,

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:38.865 align:middle line:90%
and it does communicate.

00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:41.801 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you know, there's
been talk about heart crystals.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.002 align:middle line:90%
You know, we already found

00:21:43.002 --> 00:21:44.804 align:middle line:84%
that there are crystalline
structures in the brain.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.572 align:middle line:90%
They're calcium-based crystals.

00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:47.807 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
they were there.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.375 align:middle line:84%
They're like little
receptors, and they found now

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:50.643 align:middle line:84%
that they're in the
heart as well.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.479 align:middle line:84%
So, it could be how some
communication is actually at,

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:56.315 align:middle line:84%
and that would relate to
some of the ancient teachings

00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:58.384 align:middle line:84%
that talked about this chamber
in the heart with crystals

00:21:58.384 --> 00:22:00.253 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, and
that they were trying to put

00:22:00.253 --> 00:22:02.488 align:middle line:84%
into their own language
at that time.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:04.857 align:middle line:84%
And there may be some
biological understanding of that

00:22:04.857 --> 00:22:07.026 align:middle line:90%
that emerges that validates it.

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.895 align:middle line:84%
But, I think all
that's interesting,

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:10.062 align:middle line:90%
but I think what it comes back

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.799 align:middle line:84%
to for me is the
practicality of it.

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.135 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen when I
finish this interview if I go

00:22:16.135 --> 00:22:20.173 align:middle line:84%
to my office and there's
an E-mail about something

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.809 align:middle line:84%
that I feel is not
fair, you know,

00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:25.011 align:middle line:84%
something that I
don't think was right?

00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:26.813 align:middle line:90%
What's my attitude going to be?

00:22:26.813 --> 00:22:28.881 align:middle line:90%
Is that where love stops?

00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:33.286 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a pause where
I maintain a certain poise,

00:22:33.286 --> 00:22:35.021 align:middle line:90%
a certain ability.

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Now necessarily agree
with it, but deal with it

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.061 align:middle line:84%
from a little different place
than from an anger reaction

00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:90%
or an unfair reaction.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.466 align:middle line:84%
That's the real game that's
being played right now.

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:50.636 align:middle line:84%
That's more important than to
me what has been said before

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:52.004 align:middle line:90%
or about the mystical stuff.

00:22:52.004 --> 00:22:54.674 align:middle line:84%
It's really down to
those kinds of choices.

00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:58.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, yeah, year,
because we are stressed in life,

00:22:58.044 --> 00:23:01.113 align:middle line:84%
and we do receive
those bad news,

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:05.218 align:middle line:84%
and we have those challenges,
and so what would you do

00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:07.587 align:middle line:84%
if you had that E-mail
of that really bad news.

00:23:07.587 --> 00:23:10.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Well, you know,
there are simple things

00:23:10.356 --> 00:23:13.726 align:middle line:84%
that we can do, and that's a
lot of the HeartMath techniques.

00:23:13.726 --> 00:23:15.428 align:middle line:84%
The things we teach in
our training problems.

00:23:15.428 --> 00:23:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The things we teach like in
our heart mastery courses

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.098 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:23:19.098 --> 00:23:21.267 align:middle line:84%
There are techniques
that we developed

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:23.169 align:middle line:84%
that were intentionally
designed to be simple.

00:23:23.169 --> 00:23:26.873 align:middle line:84%
We had to work to make them
simple, and the reason wanted

00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:28.441 align:middle line:84%
to make them simple
is we recognize

00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:30.776 align:middle line:84%
in the fast-paced
worlds of these times,

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.178 align:middle line:84%
people are not going
to spend a lot

00:23:32.178 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:90%
of time trying to get somewhere.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.915 align:middle line:84%
So, there's simple
heart focus techniques

00:23:35.915 --> 00:23:38.551 align:middle line:84%
to where you just
focus in your heart.

00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:41.654 align:middle line:84%
You bring your attention to
the physical area of the heart.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:45.525 align:middle line:84%
You learn just breath casually
in and out through that area,

00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:90%
but you take it a step further.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
As you do that, you make an
effort then to just activate,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.833 align:middle line:84%
as best you can, a
positive emotion.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:57.503 align:middle line:84%
It may be hard when you're
upset and not easy to do.

00:23:57.503 --> 00:24:00.339 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times you can slow
down sort of the vibratory rate

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.408 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and emotions
enough to start beginning

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:05.611 align:middle line:84%
to maybe appreciate something
else, like I'm not happy

00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:11.017 align:middle line:84%
about this, but tomorrow,
I'm going to TLC.

00:24:11.017 --> 00:24:12.418 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] You see
what I'm saying,

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:14.987 align:middle line:84%
you begin to disassociate from
it some, and you begin to put

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:17.557 align:middle line:84%
out more; you find a
place, and you begin to sort

00:24:17.557 --> 00:24:21.127 align:middle line:84%
of cultivate yourself back to
that place that feels normal

00:24:21.127 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:90%
to you or best to you.

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.997 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning it's hard
for people, because they live

00:24:24.997 --> 00:24:28.134 align:middle line:84%
so much from here, and they live
from the neck up, and the roar

00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:31.037 align:middle line:84%
of ambition and survival's
driving everything they do.

00:24:31.037 --> 00:24:33.172 align:middle line:84%
And so, when they begin to
learn HeartMath techniques,

00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:35.575 align:middle line:90%
it's like, it feels awkward.

00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:36.943 align:middle line:84%
With just a little
bit of practice

00:24:36.943 --> 00:24:40.213 align:middle line:84%
as you learn these
things, it reverses.

00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It feels awkward not to be here,
not to be connected to that.

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.185 align:middle line:90%
That feels strange.

00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:48.154 align:middle line:90%
That feels out of place.

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:49.388 align:middle line:90%
And, so for me, it's easy.

00:24:49.388 --> 00:24:53.459 align:middle line:84%
The road home is a shorter
road than it used to be.

00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:55.461 align:middle line:90%
I mean the road back to here.

00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:59.498 align:middle line:84%
I never measured my personal
growth around how many,

00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.567 align:middle line:84%
you know, really got
right all the time.

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:03.703 align:middle line:84%
I measured it, and still
continue to measure it

00:25:03.703 --> 00:25:08.074 align:middle line:84%
by how fast I return to being
the Howard Martin I want to be

00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:10.409 align:middle line:90%
when I find out that I'm not.

00:25:10.409 --> 00:25:12.511 align:middle line:84%
It's the distance;
it's the time it takes.

00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:16.082 align:middle line:84%
So, some things that may
have upset me for a week,

00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:19.518 align:middle line:84%
maybe only upset me for a day,
or something that upset me

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:22.355 align:middle line:84%
for a day only upsets me
for an hour or something

00:25:22.355 --> 00:25:23.889 align:middle line:90%
for an hour, only now a minute.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:26.626 align:middle line:84%
You know, you learn to shorten
the time, so that there's more

00:25:26.626 --> 00:25:27.994 align:middle line:90%
of an ease and flow to life.

00:25:27.994 --> 00:25:30.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, that's
beautiful, and because we want

00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:33.099 align:middle line:84%
to stay in this place,
because things flow then.

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:35.801 align:middle line:84%
How is that possible,
when we're in that state,

00:25:35.801 --> 00:25:37.637 align:middle line:90%
things just flow effortlessly?

00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.238 align:middle line:84%
We spoke about it a
little bit earlier.

00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:40.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, our founder,

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.208 align:middle line:84%
HeartMath's founders name
is Doc Childre, and he talks

00:25:42.208 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
about what he calls
the speed of balance.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.812 align:middle line:84%
About this place inside
where there is more flow,

00:25:46.812 --> 00:25:49.015 align:middle line:84%
there's more of a
natural timing.

00:25:49.015 --> 00:25:54.053 align:middle line:84%
And he introduced a new
sort of frequency or concept

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:56.489 align:middle line:84%
to us a number of years ago, a
couple years ago, that we teach

00:25:56.489 --> 00:25:59.892 align:middle line:84%
in all of our training programs
now, called the state of ease.

00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.428 align:middle line:84%
E A S E, I better say that
with my southern accent,

00:26:02.428 --> 00:26:04.497 align:middle line:90%
nobody will know what I meant.

00:26:04.497 --> 00:26:05.765 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] The state of ease.

00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:10.002 align:middle line:84%
It's this place inside
that's not just take it easy.

00:26:10.002 --> 00:26:12.905 align:middle line:84%
It's like an energy or
a frequency that's part

00:26:12.905 --> 00:26:15.841 align:middle line:84%
of the shift, and
it's this place inside

00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:20.312 align:middle line:84%
where you can find this
feeling that has more of,

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:23.449 align:middle line:84%
it's like taking the
rough corners off of life.

00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:26.686 align:middle line:84%
It has more of that feeling
and naturalness of flow.

00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:29.789 align:middle line:84%
It's an ease kind of a thing,
to where you begin to sort

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:32.291 align:middle line:84%
of ease your way
through the stressors.

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Not as much resistance.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.429 align:middle line:84%
You begin to find
that it's more liquid.

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:37.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Uh huh.

00:26:37.496 --> 00:26:38.864 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And, you
can return to that.

00:26:38.864 --> 00:26:42.334 align:middle line:84%
So, it's an exploration to catch
this frequency so to speak,

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:45.037 align:middle line:84%
this energy, and learn
to what it feels like.

00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:48.908 align:middle line:84%
And then learn to recreate it
in the midst of the craziness.

00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The athletes and
the supportive know this,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.379 align:middle line:90%
in golf, people know it too.

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:56.782 align:middle line:84%
You have to start; this
is a very important thing

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:59.785 align:middle line:84%
to really have all
your capacities, right?

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:03.322 align:middle line:84%
Is there some studies
done around sports too?

00:27:03.322 --> 00:27:04.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Martin: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:05.758 align:middle line:84%
We've worked with a lot of
athletes here at HeartMath.

00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We've worked with all
pop, not all, but many,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.664 align:middle line:84%
many population sectors,
including athletes.

00:27:11.664 --> 00:27:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, I talked about the
four ways the heart communicates

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.235 align:middle line:84%
with the brain and
the rest of the body.

00:27:16.235 --> 00:27:18.037 align:middle line:84%
When they are working
at optimal state,

00:27:18.037 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
we go into a state
called coherence.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.475 align:middle line:90%
There's a medical name for that.

00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:25.978 align:middle line:84%
It's called psychophysiological
coherence.

00:27:25.978 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
What coherence is
is a highly-ordered

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.148 align:middle line:90%
and synchronized state,

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:33.753 align:middle line:84%
where all the body's biological
systems begin to work together.

00:27:33.753 --> 00:27:36.322 align:middle line:84%
They all, what's happening
is they're all synchronizing

00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythmic beating
pattern of the heart,

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:40.092 align:middle line:84%
which is the master and
the maker in our body.

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:43.462 align:middle line:84%
So, digestion, respiration,
immune system response,

00:27:43.462 --> 00:27:46.799 align:middle line:84%
hormonal relations, all those
things begin to then synchronize

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and line up with the rhythmic
beating pattern of the heart.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.808 align:middle line:84%
There's a psychological part
of it, because when you're

00:27:55.808 --> 00:27:56.942 align:middle line:90%
in the coherent state,

00:27:56.942 --> 00:27:59.945 align:middle line:84%
you naturally feel
more positive emotions.

00:27:59.945 --> 00:28:02.381 align:middle line:84%
You get to that state by
making an effort to feel them,

00:28:02.381 --> 00:28:03.949 align:middle line:84%
but once you're there,
they sort of flow,

00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:07.052 align:middle line:84%
and those positive emotions are
the ones we've already talked

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:09.755 align:middle line:84%
about, or I've talked about
and mentioned, like love, care,

00:28:09.755 --> 00:28:11.957 align:middle line:84%
appreciation, kindness,
non-judgment,

00:28:11.957 --> 00:28:13.325 align:middle line:90%
patience, those kind of things.

00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:15.327 align:middle line:90%
So, in the coherent state,

00:28:15.327 --> 00:28:17.763 align:middle line:84%
you have this highly-ordered
physiological

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:20.499 align:middle line:84%
and emotional condition
in yourself.

00:28:20.499 --> 00:28:23.869 align:middle line:84%
So, everything from reaction
speed time to visual field,

00:28:23.869 --> 00:28:25.971 align:middle line:84%
all your sensitivities
are there.

00:28:25.971 --> 00:28:27.673 align:middle line:84%
You're more sensitive
to your environment.

00:28:27.673 --> 00:28:29.175 align:middle line:84%
You're more sensitive
to yourself.

00:28:29.175 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You're more sensitive
to what's going on.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.045 align:middle line:84%
You have a greater
ability to choose.

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:35.881 align:middle line:84%
You have a greater ability
to regulate your emotions.

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:39.185 align:middle line:84%
Athletes equate that to
what happens in the zone.

00:28:39.185 --> 00:28:41.487 align:middle line:84%
So, the measurement of coherence
is the closest measurement

00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
that we know of to
measuring the zone.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.125 align:middle line:84%
So, we've worked with
professional golfers,

00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:48.727 align:middle line:84%
professional football
players, Olympic athletes

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:52.965 align:middle line:84%
of various kinds, gymnasts,
skiers, swimmers, all kinds.

00:28:52.965 --> 00:28:56.302 align:middle line:84%
And, they use our technology
and our simple techniques

00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:59.738 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to develop
more of that coherence

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:02.441 align:middle line:84%
in themselves naturally,
so that when they're

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:05.110 align:middle line:84%
in athletic performance, it
becomes second nature to them.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.912 align:middle line:84%
Because, they can't think
about all that when they're

00:29:06.912 --> 00:29:11.684 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a football
game, but they can learn to sort

00:29:11.684 --> 00:29:13.385 align:middle line:84%
of find that place
inside themselves.

00:29:13.385 --> 00:29:16.322 align:middle line:84%
Their baseline of coherence
increases and so some

00:29:16.322 --> 00:29:18.290 align:middle line:84%
of those athletes have
had great results.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.025 align:middle line:90%
Golfers, professional golfers

00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:22.094 align:middle line:84%
on the PGA tours have
had their scores lowered

00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:23.262 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:25.564 align:middle line:84%
And, they make more money
as a result of that,

00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:28.968 align:middle line:84%
and they use our
inner balance trainer,

00:29:28.968 --> 00:29:31.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the coherence building
technology that we have,

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.873 align:middle line:84%
and they practice their
techniques and things like that.

00:29:33.873 --> 00:29:38.544 align:middle line:84%
And, it's just one of the
applications for HeartMath is

00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:42.514 align:middle line:84%
in helping athletes find
more of that zone state

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.884 align:middle line:84%
that they can then use
to improve what they do.

00:29:44.884 --> 00:29:46.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, tell us
how this is applicable

00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:48.454 align:middle line:90%
to business people.

00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:50.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Gosh, in
all kinds of ways.

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And banker's please.

00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:52.958 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:53.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: How about
the lawyers.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:57.496 align:middle line:90%
That's a judgment, man.

00:29:57.496 --> 00:29:59.298 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we do a lot of in
business, have for years.

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:02.434 align:middle line:84%
You know, training individuals,
coaching executives,

00:30:02.434 --> 00:30:05.871 align:middle line:84%
doing large training programs
in Fortune 100 companies.

00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:08.707 align:middle line:84%
Today, a lot of organizational
training is actually done

00:30:08.707 --> 00:30:10.175 align:middle line:84%
in healthcare in the
United States, in hospitals.

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:13.512 align:middle line:84%
And, there's a lot of
business application for it.

00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:16.515 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have, in our
hospital programs for example,

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:20.119 align:middle line:84%
we've done studies where we have
significantly reduced the amount

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:23.455 align:middle line:84%
of employee turnover, and
we've actually got cost savings

00:30:23.455 --> 00:30:24.657 align:middle line:90%
that go against that.

00:30:24.657 --> 00:30:26.325 align:middle line:84%
We've actually been able
to show in other studies,

00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:84%
reduction of healthcare
cost to the company

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.097 align:middle line:84%
from the employees using
HeartMath, and therefore,

00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:33.198 align:middle line:90%
having less health issues

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:35.501 align:middle line:84%
that were stress-related
in the first place.

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Executives reported
about the degree

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.106 align:middle line:84%
of decision-making
improvement that they have,

00:30:41.106 --> 00:30:43.575 align:middle line:84%
as relative to going
through HeartMath training.

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.044 align:middle line:84%
So, a lot of business
applications,

00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and there are changes trying
to occur in business too.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.915 align:middle line:84%
I was just left a call before
I came to your interview

00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:52.451 align:middle line:84%
of a whole group of high-level
business professionals

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.486 align:middle line:84%
and consultants, that
we formed a small group,

00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:56.355 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking now
about change in business,

00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:59.258 align:middle line:84%
how we bring more
consciousness into business.

00:30:59.258 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And, so there's a lot of
movement there going on as well

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.828 align:middle line:90%
in the business world.

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:04.129 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the business
people feel,

00:31:04.129 --> 00:31:06.765 align:middle line:84%
and maybe to some degree I
believe that they're right,

00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:10.069 align:middle line:84%
that business is the major
influencer of social change,

00:31:10.069 --> 00:31:12.104 align:middle line:84%
so they say if you can
help business change,

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:13.639 align:middle line:84%
you can then help
society change.

00:31:13.639 --> 00:31:16.775 align:middle line:84%
And, so, there are lots of
applications in business.

00:31:16.775 --> 00:31:20.346 align:middle line:84%
Healthcare certainly with
HeartMath is important.

00:31:20.346 --> 00:31:24.616 align:middle line:84%
One area that our nonprofit
works in, it's really important

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:26.418 align:middle line:84%
to our mission is
working with children.

00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:27.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes, I was
going to ask you, yes.

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:29.388 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, we have
programs for children.

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:33.359 align:middle line:84%
We have hundreds of trained
teachers around the country.

00:31:33.359 --> 00:31:35.761 align:middle line:84%
I think HeartMath in one form
or another is in something

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:37.196 align:middle line:90%
like 5,000 schools now.

00:31:37.196 --> 00:31:38.564 align:middle line:84%
It could be a little
in some places,

00:31:38.564 --> 00:31:40.265 align:middle line:84%
bigger in others,
but 5,000 schools.

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:41.934 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of school.

00:31:41.934 --> 00:31:44.303 align:middle line:84%
And, it's to really
help children;

00:31:44.303 --> 00:31:47.606 align:middle line:84%
I think the core benefit of it
in the educational setting is

00:31:47.606 --> 00:31:51.143 align:middle line:84%
to help them learn more
about their emotions,

00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:55.447 align:middle line:84%
and how to use their emotions
in a way that benefits them,

00:31:55.447 --> 00:31:57.916 align:middle line:84%
and to help regulate
their emotions.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:31:59.685 align:middle line:90%
Because, we're not taught that.

00:31:59.685 --> 00:32:02.121 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, we live in a
world today where there's

00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:05.257 align:middle line:84%
so much input, and so many
things are hitting us all the

00:32:05.257 --> 00:32:07.059 align:middle line:90%
time, and every perception

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:09.094 align:middle line:84%
that we have has an
emotional response to it.

00:32:09.094 --> 00:32:11.797 align:middle line:84%
And, you take a young child and
your put them in this world,

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:13.599 align:middle line:84%
and they're exposed to
so many negative things,

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:15.901 align:middle line:84%
and so much stimulation
is going on.

00:32:15.901 --> 00:32:18.904 align:middle line:84%
Without a solid emotional
footing, it's very difficult.

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:20.205 align:middle line:90%
It's very confusing for them.

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:22.941 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for
them to be happy

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.176 align:middle line:90%
and to find meaning in life.

00:32:24.176 --> 00:32:27.012 align:middle line:84%
So, we feel it's very
important to teach children

00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:28.881 align:middle line:84%
about their emotions
and about emotional,

00:32:28.881 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:90%
we call it emotional regulation.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.986 align:middle line:84%
And, teach them emotional
regulation skills,

00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:36.855 align:middle line:84%
so that that they can
better navigate life.

00:32:36.855 --> 00:32:38.657 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's important
to have the academics

00:32:38.657 --> 00:32:42.494 align:middle line:84%
and to learn all that, but I
do think we can do a better job

00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:43.962 align:middle line:84%
at teaching children
about things

00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:46.465 align:middle line:84%
that are really going even
be more important in terms

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.701 align:middle line:84%
of their fulfillment and
success as they grow.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:52.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: What are some of the
latest research or applications,

00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:55.374 align:middle line:84%
or products, or things
that are coming through?

00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:56.508 align:middle line:90%
Because 20 years, huh,

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.143 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing this
for 20 years here.

00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: It makes me
sound old, doesn't it?

00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.046 align:middle line:90%
Do I look that old?

00:33:01.046 --> 00:33:03.282 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Well,
here's the thing.

00:33:03.282 --> 00:33:07.086 align:middle line:84%
The research that's going on
now, we've already done so much

00:33:07.086 --> 00:33:10.255 align:middle line:84%
on coherence and heart/brain
communication and all that.

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:13.192 align:middle line:84%
We move now into more of an
energetic research modality,

00:33:13.192 --> 00:33:15.461 align:middle line:84%
and Roland McCready is
the Director of Research

00:33:15.461 --> 00:33:18.931 align:middle line:84%
at HeartMath, and he's doing
studies now on the effects

00:33:18.931 --> 00:33:21.266 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
energy fields and things

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:23.001 align:middle line:90%
like that on DNA itself.

00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:24.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:33:24.203 --> 00:33:24.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: And, the
changes in DNA confirmation

00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:25.671 align:middle line:90%
and what goes on there.

00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.439 align:middle line:90%
That's one area of study.

00:33:27.439 --> 00:33:30.209 align:middle line:84%
Another part of HeartMath,
which is one of the things

00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:33.712 align:middle line:84%
that gives me the most joy, is
the global coherence initiative,

00:33:33.712 --> 00:33:35.047 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if
you're aware of that.

00:33:35.047 --> 00:33:36.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yeah, I've
heard of it.

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: What we did is
we created a membership

00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
organization about five years
ago to bring people together

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.656 align:middle line:84%
from all around the world to
use our heart-focused care

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:48.527 align:middle line:84%
and our attention to help
shift planetary consciousness,

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:52.431 align:middle line:84%
from the chaos and discord
that we see, to more balance

00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:56.001 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation, and
really more enduring peace.

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.971 align:middle line:84%
So, it's a membership
that's free.

00:33:58.971 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
There are about 50, I think,
3 thousand members now.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.577 align:middle line:84%
They come from over
a hundred countries,

00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:10.414 align:middle line:84%
and we do heart-focus things to
put out radiationally, you know,

00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:11.950 align:middle line:84%
using heart focus,
care, and intention

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.086 align:middle line:84%
into the field environment
to help ease things

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:17.456 align:middle line:90%
in the planetary stressors.

00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:18.856 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are thousands

00:34:18.856 --> 00:34:22.026 align:middle line:84%
of organizations doing something
similar, and we applaud that.

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:24.028 align:middle line:84%
And, we've never wanted
to be competitive,

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:27.132 align:middle line:84%
or trying to be the big
thing or anything like that.

00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:30.501 align:middle line:84%
We just wanted to do our part
in that regard, and so we do.

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.938 align:middle line:84%
But, the part that we bring to
that is a little bit different,

00:34:32.938 --> 00:34:35.474 align:middle line:90%
is we brought our science to it.

00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:38.911 align:middle line:84%
Our scientists have developed
very sensitive technology.

00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:41.747 align:middle line:84%
They can measure changes in
the earth's energetic fields.

00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:42.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yep.

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:43.849 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: The earth
produces energetic fields.

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:46.385 align:middle line:90%
Think of them as part of nature.

00:34:46.385 --> 00:34:48.653 align:middle line:84%
The part of the earth
as a living system.

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.222 align:middle line:90%
There are two primary ones.

00:34:50.222 --> 00:34:52.557 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
geomagnetic field.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.758 align:middle line:90%
Most people know what that is.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.593 align:middle line:90%
It's what a compass picks up.

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:59.031 align:middle line:84%
It's the field created by
the spinning by the iron core

00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:00.299 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the earth.

00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:03.268 align:middle line:84%
It creates an electromagnetic
field around the planet.

00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:05.804 align:middle line:84%
The other one is called the
ionosphere, and it's a field

00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:08.974 align:middle line:84%
that operates just
above the atmosphere.

00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It goes about 120 some
miles up into space.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:13.378 align:middle line:84%
It's less dense than
the geomagnetic field,

00:35:13.378 --> 00:35:14.913 align:middle line:90%
and they work together.

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:17.316 align:middle line:84%
And what they do fundamentally
is they provide a protective

00:35:17.316 --> 00:35:18.851 align:middle line:90%
layer around the planet.

00:35:18.851 --> 00:35:20.752 align:middle line:84%
It protects us from
all the space stuff.

00:35:20.752 --> 00:35:24.223 align:middle line:84%
You know, solar radiation,
cosmic rays, all those things,

00:35:24.223 --> 00:35:26.758 align:middle line:84%
and without those fields,
we can't have life.

00:35:26.758 --> 00:35:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We can't have these
pretty flowers.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:90%
We can't have grass.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.095 align:middle line:90%
We can't have you and me.

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:32.531 align:middle line:84%
You know, that would all
go away without the fields.

00:35:32.531 --> 00:35:35.334 align:middle line:84%
So, they literally
are part of the earth.

00:35:35.334 --> 00:35:37.402 align:middle line:84%
Now, those fields
are always changing,

00:35:37.402 --> 00:35:40.038 align:middle line:84%
and they're constantly
in fluctuation.

00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:43.909 align:middle line:84%
And research going on for a
long time has definitively shown

00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:48.580 align:middle line:84%
that changes in these fields
are creating changes in us,

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.883 align:middle line:84%
individually and
societally collectively,

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:84%
everything from hospital
admissions to health issues

00:35:56.922 --> 00:36:02.628 align:middle line:84%
to changes in the stock
market to the acceleration

00:36:02.628 --> 00:36:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of creative periods in
society like the Renaissance.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.665 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
have been tracked

00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:08.533 align:middle line:84%
to changes occurring
in these fields.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.836 align:middle line:84%
So, it's well-known
now and well-documented

00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.072 align:middle line:90%
that these fields are relating.

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:19.945 align:middle line:84%
Now, we believe that not only
is that true, we also believe

00:36:19.945 --> 00:36:23.148 align:middle line:84%
that mass human consciousness
is impacting those fields,

00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:27.886 align:middle line:84%
that we are all radiating
electromagnetically,

00:36:27.886 --> 00:36:29.254 align:middle line:90%
something from our hearts,

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:31.723 align:middle line:84%
and that that changes all
the time with our emotions.

00:36:31.723 --> 00:36:35.661 align:middle line:84%
And, so our hypothesis is
that mass human emotion,

00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:38.563 align:middle line:84%
whether that be positive
or negative,

00:36:38.563 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:84%
has a measureable
influence on the geomagnetic

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.502 align:middle line:90%
and ionosphere fields.

00:36:43.502 --> 00:36:48.473 align:middle line:84%
So, that there's a two way
communication that's going on.

00:36:48.473 --> 00:36:49.608 align:middle line:90%
So, what they've done is

00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:51.343 align:middle line:84%
that they've developed
a sensing technology.

00:36:51.343 --> 00:36:57.149 align:middle line:84%
They are developing a global
monitoring sensor site,

00:36:57.149 --> 00:37:00.652 align:middle line:84%
an array of these things
placed around the planet

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:03.055 align:middle line:84%
to study the fields
in their entireties.

00:37:03.055 --> 00:37:03.989 align:middle line:90%
A ground base system.

00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:05.457 align:middle line:90%
This has never been done before.

00:37:05.457 --> 00:37:06.825 align:middle line:90%
Normally, a university

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:10.028 align:middle line:84%
or a government would do
this, and we're doing it.

00:37:10.028 --> 00:37:13.565 align:middle line:84%
So, we are, initially,
we'll have 12 sensor sites.

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.867 align:middle line:90%
And, they are expensive.

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:84%
They require installation and
maintenance, and all kinds

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.506 align:middle line:84%
of things, but right now we
have four working sensor sites.

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:24.643 align:middle line:84%
There's one here in our
area, in Northern California.

00:37:24.643 --> 00:37:26.978 align:middle line:90%
There's one in Northern Canada.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:31.817 align:middle line:84%
There's one in the UK, and
there's one in Saudi Arabia.

00:37:31.817 --> 00:37:35.687 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, the fifth one
is going into New Zealand,

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:37.856 align:middle line:84%
and then soon after
that, a sixth one will be

00:37:37.856 --> 00:37:41.727 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, so they're
being strategically placed.

00:37:41.727 --> 00:37:44.496 align:middle line:84%
So, what they're doing is
they're studying the effects

00:37:44.496 --> 00:37:45.797 align:middle line:90%
of these fields on us.

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:49.001 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to provide
more relevant information.

00:37:49.001 --> 00:37:51.403 align:middle line:84%
What they found for
example is that the part

00:37:51.403 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of us that's most influenced
by these fields is the heart.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Heart rate variability, which
is the measurement of the beat

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.411 align:middle line:90%
to beat changes in the heart.

00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:01.847 align:middle line:84%
It's the major thing
that's influenced by chances

00:38:01.847 --> 00:38:03.014 align:middle line:90%
in the geomagnetic field.

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.716 align:middle line:84%
So, they're discovering
new things

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:06.651 align:middle line:84%
that will help the
research literature.

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:10.088 align:middle line:84%
They will also be
testing the hypothesis

00:38:10.088 --> 00:38:13.258 align:middle line:84%
that mass human emotion
is impacting these fields.

00:38:13.258 --> 00:38:15.660 align:middle line:84%
There are many people,
some that you know that are

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.764 align:middle line:90%
on our boards of this project.

00:38:18.764 --> 00:38:20.766 align:middle line:84%
People like Marcy Schaumhoff
[assumed spelling], Greg Braden,

00:38:20.766 --> 00:38:24.369 align:middle line:84%
Lynn McTaggert, Jack Hanfield,
and Jack said to me one day,

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.438 align:middle line:84%
he said, I think this is
the greatest experiment

00:38:26.438 --> 00:38:27.639 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.242 align:middle line:84%
And, I asked him why he
thought that, and he said,

00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:32.611 align:middle line:84%
if this proves to be true,
which you will have shown

00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:36.214 align:middle line:84%
through science, is that all
of our thoughts, our prayers,

00:38:36.214 --> 00:38:40.385 align:middle line:84%
our meditations, our intentions,
our affirmations are real,

00:38:40.385 --> 00:38:43.054 align:middle line:84%
and have a measurable
impact on the earth itself.

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:44.222 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's huge.

00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:46.191 align:middle line:90%
That's a paradigm shift.

00:38:46.191 --> 00:38:48.193 align:middle line:84%
So, that's what we're up to
with our new science today.

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:50.028 align:middle line:90%
It's that kind of research,

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:52.531 align:middle line:84%
studying the earth's energetic
fields, our relationship

00:38:52.531 --> 00:38:55.667 align:middle line:84%
to them, and then the
epigenetic research;

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:59.204 align:middle line:84%
the study of the effect
of air fields on DNA.

00:38:59.204 --> 00:39:00.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: That makes
perfect sense.

00:39:00.272 --> 00:39:02.374 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're trees
then, and really,

00:39:02.374 --> 00:39:04.910 align:middle line:84%
really part of this
big huge co-creation.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: It goes back to
something you said earlier

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.879 align:middle line:84%
about the whole connectivity
of everything.

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:09.448 align:middle line:84%
You know, what science
is now showing is

00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:12.217 align:middle line:84%
that at energetic levels,
we are all connected.

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:15.086 align:middle line:84%
You know, there is no separation
at the energetic levels.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.822 align:middle line:84%
It's all real, and
we're all connected,

00:39:16.822 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's just proving
out to be true now.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It feels like
when our rhythm slows down

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:24.963 align:middle line:84%
and our heart slows down,
it seems like we're just

00:39:24.963 --> 00:39:28.033 align:middle line:84%
at the same beat as mother
earth, you know, and the planet.

00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:29.434 align:middle line:90%
Is there such a thing?

00:39:29.434 --> 00:39:31.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I think, yes,
there definitely is,

00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:33.205 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's what we're
starting to look at and see,

00:39:33.205 --> 00:39:35.841 align:middle line:84%
that there's an energetic
rhythm of the earth.

00:39:35.841 --> 00:39:37.175 align:middle line:84%
We can call it mother
earth, you know.

00:39:37.175 --> 00:39:39.644 align:middle line:84%
We can call it Gaiam,
you know, Gaiam TV.

00:39:39.644 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We can call it a lot of things,
but I think that's what's going

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.016 align:middle line:84%
on is we're learning more
about how this resonances work

00:39:45.016 --> 00:39:46.351 align:middle line:90%
and how we interface with that.

00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:47.919 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
nature, if you think

00:39:47.919 --> 00:39:50.522 align:middle line:84%
about where we're sitting right
now as we do this interview,

00:39:50.522 --> 00:39:52.724 align:middle line:84%
there's a naturalness
to this that allows us

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:55.026 align:middle line:84%
to feel differently than
if we were in an airport.

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:56.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh, yeah.

00:39:56.194 --> 00:39:56.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: You know,
doing the same interview.

00:39:56.962 --> 00:39:58.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Oh, yeah.

00:39:58.363 --> 00:39:59.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: There's an influence
that all of these things have,

00:39:59.664 --> 00:40:02.501 align:middle line:84%
and there's a connection we
all to the life that comes

00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:05.103 align:middle line:84%
through energetically, and
I think that's why people

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:07.939 align:middle line:84%
like nature, is there's
something about mother earth

00:40:07.939 --> 00:40:09.975 align:middle line:84%
and nature, and the energetic
frequency that plants

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:11.343 align:middle line:90%
and these things have for us.

00:40:11.343 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That we enjoy so much,
and we want more of.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.117 align:middle line:84%
And, that's certainly
why I live where I live.

00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:22.687 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Um hum, um
hum, and it impacts also,

00:40:22.687 --> 00:40:24.422 align:middle line:90%
of course, our health.

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:27.259 align:middle line:84%
We didn't speak too much about
that, but our weight also, no?

00:40:27.259 --> 00:40:30.495 align:middle line:84%
And, when there is
this coherence,

00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:32.931 align:middle line:84%
we also find more
naturally our weight.

00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:36.001 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of French doctors
speak about that, or Canadian.

00:40:36.001 --> 00:40:37.802 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: Yeah, we do
a program that's called

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.605 align:middle line:84%
"Stopping Emotional Eating", and
it's about developing coherence,

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:44.309 align:middle line:84%
so that we learn to get to the
emotions that underlie a lot

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:46.044 align:middle line:84%
of the eating issues
that we have,

00:40:46.044 --> 00:40:49.748 align:middle line:84%
and we have coaches called
HeartMath One on One Providers

00:40:49.748 --> 00:40:51.149 align:middle line:90%
that teach this class.

00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:53.852 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them do, and they teach
this class, a lot of them do,

00:40:53.852 --> 00:40:55.587 align:middle line:84%
and they teach people,
they coach them on learning

00:40:55.587 --> 00:40:56.588 align:middle line:90%
about emotional eating.

00:40:56.588 --> 00:40:57.622 align:middle line:84%
We found, research
has already shown

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.525 align:middle line:84%
that stress does
create weight gain.

00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:04.296 align:middle line:84%
It increases the production
of a hormone called cortisol.

00:41:04.296 --> 00:41:07.032 align:middle line:84%
Too much cortisol has a
negative effect on our health.

00:41:07.032 --> 00:41:09.768 align:middle line:84%
One of the effects that it
has is it causes excess weight

00:41:09.768 --> 00:41:11.336 align:middle line:90%
to build up on waist and hips,

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:13.605 align:middle line:84%
and that's been directly
linked to cortisol.

00:41:13.605 --> 00:41:16.441 align:middle line:84%
So, you reduce the stress,
reduce the stress hormones

00:41:16.441 --> 00:41:19.744 align:middle line:84%
in some cases, you can see
changes in weight loss.

00:41:19.744 --> 00:41:21.846 align:middle line:84%
So, there is a connection
to all those things.

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:23.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yeah, beautiful.

00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so much for
this delicious interview.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.786 align:middle line:84%
If there is a last thing
you can leave us with,

00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:29.955 align:middle line:90%
some last little message for us.

00:41:29.955 --> 00:41:31.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin: I would like
to give you a message.

00:41:31.189 --> 00:41:33.024 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to say is
this, and I'd like to say it

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:35.193 align:middle line:84%
to everybody who's
viewing right now.

00:41:35.193 --> 00:41:37.729 align:middle line:84%
You know, as I think about
where we are today in the shift

00:41:37.729 --> 00:41:38.997 align:middle line:84%
and all that we're
going through,

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:40.665 align:middle line:84%
I think there's one thing
that I want people to try

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:43.635 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate more
than anything else,

00:41:43.635 --> 00:41:47.973 align:middle line:84%
and that is to please have
compassion for yourself.

00:41:47.973 --> 00:41:49.441 align:middle line:90%
Be kind and gentle to yourself.

00:41:49.441 --> 00:41:51.776 align:middle line:84%
Recognize you don't
have to push right now.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.211 align:middle line:90%
The shift is happening anyway.

00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:57.248 align:middle line:84%
Find the flow with it, and
don't beat up on yourself.

00:41:57.248 --> 00:42:01.286 align:middle line:84%
And, when you're down a
little bit, don't lose hope,

00:42:01.286 --> 00:42:02.587 align:middle line:90%
don't go into despair.

00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:04.856 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that all of us
are doing the best we can.

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.759 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting, but
challenging time to be alive,

00:42:07.759 --> 00:42:09.761 align:middle line:84%
so be kind and gentle
with yourself.

00:42:09.761 --> 00:42:12.163 align:middle line:84%
Please, please, please,
have compassion to yourself,

00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:13.632 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I'd
like to say to everybody

00:42:13.632 --> 00:42:14.866 align:middle line:90%
at the end of our interview.

00:42:14.866 --> 00:42:16.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Thank you, thank
you very much, Howard.

00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:19.604 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, this is co-creator
sending you much love.

00:42:19.604 --> 00:42:20.872 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, beautiful
[background music] heart

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:29.581 align:middle line:84%
to heart connection from
HeartMath here in Boulder Creek.

00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:32.784 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
