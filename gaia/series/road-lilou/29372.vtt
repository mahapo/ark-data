00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.890 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Hello, this
is Lilou for "Gaiam TV,"

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and today in Denmark
near Copenhagen,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.730 align:middle line:84%
right before the
bridge actually--

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIET: To Sweden, yeah.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.583 align:middle line:90%
LILOU MACE: To Sweden.

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:90%
And we're in your home.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.824 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Niels.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: You're welcome.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: So today
with Niels Harrit,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think the best is that you
explain to us your background

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and how you got to this topic
that we're going to talk about.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about lies, truth, 9/11,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:90%
what has been really going on.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard of you
through other sources,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and I had to come and
interview you all the way here.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that this is going
to be very informative video.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
having the courage

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
to speak out your truth.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: My
name is Niels Harrit.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm 67-years-old, and I am
retired associate professor

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
of chemistry from the University
of Copenhagen. I still

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
have my office
though, so you call me

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:90%
emeritus, professor emeritus.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I still have my office.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
I still have research to do.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Over these 45 years, I have
taught chemistry on all levels

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
from elementary up to PhD level.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I have-- I have supervised, I
don't know, maybe 20-25 PhDs.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The number of master
degrees I have delivered

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:90%
is-- I don't count.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I have published more than
60 papers in, believe me,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
the best peer-reviewed journals.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still involved in
some very interesting research

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
together with my
physics colleagues

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
at the Niels Bohr
Institute of Copenhagen.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is my
professional status.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And-- but for today's subject, I
will say that 9/11-- I probably

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:84%
experienced it in much the
same way as everybody else

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:90%
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I was appalled and
shocked by the events,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and I accepted the official
story without much speculation

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and without much hesitation.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the official story-- we're
talking about World Trade

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Center predominantly--
the official story

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
was that the twin towers
were hit by two airliners

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and subsequently collapsed
due to the impact.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think much
about it at that time.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Even though I
realized the-- what

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
do you say-- the--
the catastrophic-- the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
magnitude of the event.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And-- and also what
happened subsequently

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Denmark,
my country, getting

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
into the war in Afghanistan
and how nature got involved

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is a story on its
own of which I was

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
not aware because much later.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But the years went by, and about
2007, I think it was, my wife

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and I-- actually was my wife.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Somebody sent a DVD to
my wife, because she

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
has been involved in
environmental and peace

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:90%
activism all her life.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I suppose this DVD was
sent to us anonymously.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And it took some time before we
eventually took a look at it.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was an eye opener.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a very decisive
moment, pivotal moment for me.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
going to talk about.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Because in that DVD,
there was a presentation

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
done by an American
physics professor

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:84%
from Brigham Young
University in Utah.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
His name is Steven Earl
Jones, and the presentation--

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.210 align:middle line:84%
it was simply a recording
from a presentation he

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:90%
was giving his own university.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And during that presentation,
he showed a building which--

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
obviously a skyscraper
which was coming down

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
completely symmetrical--
symmetrically

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and for no apparent
reason at all.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
This was what we later
learned as Building 7.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The point being that he
was talking about World

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
Trade Center destruction.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The point being that I thought--
and we are in Copenhagen,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Denmark-- we thought
and many people

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
still believe the World Trade
Center were the twin towers.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But World Trade
Center was a center.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I learned on that occasion.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Where the twin towers was
Number One, Number Two,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
World Trade Center Three
was the Marriott Hotel

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.020 align:middle line:84%
behind the twin
towers, 22 stories.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And World Trade Center
Four, Five, and Six

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:90%
were relatively small building.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But this building, Building
7, was a huge building

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:90%
for Danish standards at least.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
a 47-story building,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
186 meters-- I don't know
how many yards, feet that is.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
But 100 and-- 186 meters
and a little less than half

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
the height of the Twin Towers.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw in this
video was this building

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
collapsing, as I told you,
completely symmetrically.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It was going down straight.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It took 6.5 seconds for
this building to collapse.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And the pictures
you saw it falling

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
exactly into its own footprint.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:84%
That means it's going
completely down like that.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Watching this video
by Steven E. Jones

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
caused me to have two problems.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The first one was that--
I realized that this

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:90%
was World Trade Center.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And here was a building
which is much-- twice as

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
high as any building in
Denmark collapsing like that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
This is seven hours after the
collapse of the north tower.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So this was a monumental event,
and why has this not been

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.840 align:middle line:90%
shown on Danish television?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:90%
Why did I not know this?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
That was shocking.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
relates to my training

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
as an actual
scientist, because it

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
is my job-- I've been trained
to see my physical environment

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:90%
with an analytical mind.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I see something,
I involuntarily try

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how it's working.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And why does this happen?

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Why does this happen?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the bend of any
natural scientist's nature.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
I'm doing pretty well.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, I must say.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But at this location, I
couldn't understand why

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:90%
this building should collapse.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, once
you have seen it,

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.340 align:middle line:84%
there's no way back in
having the same feeling.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Why is this building just
collapsing just like that?

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So I had to look into it.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:90%
No way back.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a
couple of weeks,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:84%
actually, to realize the-- the
importance of what I had seen

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and how this observation was
a key event in our lifetime

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and how important it was.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It took a long time
to realize that.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we later
should go back

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to this-- what do
you call this--

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
this time when it takes to--
the time of latency, actually.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The time it takes you
to realize things.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes time, and we
should return to this issue.

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It takes time for you to
realize what is happening.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.850 align:middle line:84%
It took me about, say, six,
seven weeks when I realized

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that I, as a scientist--
here in Denmark,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
the government pays
your education.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And they had paid my
salary for 40 years just

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:90%
to-- to be more clever.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:90%
So it was my duty, actually.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It was payback time to put
my expertise, my knowledge,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.945 align:middle line:84%
my understanding
into the service

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:08.230 align:middle line:84%
of--of the society and tell
me what is going on here.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
I'm doing right now.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: So tell us,
what have you found out?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.424 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: In short-- the
short or the long version.

00:09:15.424 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:90%
LILOU MACE: The long version.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: The long version.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
be maybe too long,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
so maybe we should just
a summary first, OK?

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
There were three skyscrapers
collapsing on that day.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
The twin towers.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The first one was collapsing a
little bit before 10 o'clock.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:90%
The other one at half past 10.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
The twin towers,
the South Tower was

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:90%
collapsing-- collapsing first.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The North Tower
collapsing the latest.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And then this
Building Seven which

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
collapsed seven hours later.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are told that
these three collapses

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
were caused by the impact
of the two airliners.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:90%
That is a lie.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
From a scientific point of view,
no matter how you twist or turn

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the evidence which
is very important,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:84%
there is no physical
connection between the impact

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
of the two airliners
and the collapse

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:90%
of the three skyscrapers.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:90%
It's simply not true.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:90%
So we have been told a lie.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm saying this, I'm
not referring to weaknesses.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not referring to rumors.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not referring
to assumptions.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to the basic
laws of physics and chemistry.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
The official version,
namely that these three

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
skyscrapers came down due to
fires, that is very short.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
The official version that
the three skyscrapers

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:90%
came down due two fires.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It is-- this explanation
is-- is violating

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:90%
basic principles of science.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking
about-- I have to bring

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
in Sir Isaac Newton,
the name of who

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:90%
should be known to everybody.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
His tomb is in Westminster
Abbey in London

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
for very good reasons.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Because he was one of the first
giants of natural science.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a book
which came out in 1687.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Principia", and
it describes how bodies move

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world here.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Fundamental laws.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And most people who have taken
physics courses in high school

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
have had heard about
Newton's Three Laws.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And for 300-- I have to make a
rough calculation-- 325 years,

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
these laws have
proven indispensable.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:90%
That you cannot break.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no exception
from Newton's Laws.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And the official explanation
is violating at least two

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of these laws.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
That is, I'm referring
to physical principles

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.380 align:middle line:84%
which are so fundamental that
there is no way around them.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So the official explanation for
the collapses of World Trade

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%
Center is a scientific fraud.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It's-- it's a lie.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the short version.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.467 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: But tell
us about those laws.

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: Newton's Laws?

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:90%
LILOU MACE: Yeah.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: Oh.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: In short
so we can get--

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
even though if we're
not all scientists,

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
we can get a little bit more.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: Well, the easiest
thing here to understand

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is the collapse of Building
Seven, the last one,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.170 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
most clean cut example.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- the government,
it took them 7 years, actually,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to come with the technical
account for that collapse.

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:84%
They postponed this
report for seven years

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
until they couldn't
hold back anymore.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Because what you saw is
this 47-story skyscraper

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
coming down, as I told you,
completely symmetrical.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to
make-- to measure how

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:90%
fast this collapse is going.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And the 47th story, when it--
it-- when it starts to move,

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
it goes into what
we call free fall.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
It means that it moves, it
accelerates to the ground,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
with exactly the same speed
as an object falling freely.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.751 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's-- try with myself.
We'll see.

00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, watch this.
OK, I release it.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, it goes like that.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
There is no resistance.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
It is falling
absolutely free fall,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually
accelerating when

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:90%
it falls towards the ground.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
to the 47th floor

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
of World Trade Center 7.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So the moment it
starts to move, there

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely no supporting
structure left in the building.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Every-- and this building
was designed-- there were

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:90%
24 core columns, very sturdy.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
They were carrying
between 60% and 70%

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:90%
of the weight of the building.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there were 57
perimeter columns all the way

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
in the-- in the perimeter.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the building
started to move,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
all these columns
had to be removed.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
There were nothing
supporting the 47th story.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
If some idiot has been
standing on the 47th floor,

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and released, say a
stone, out of the window,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.665 align:middle line:84%
the stone would have moved
at exactly the same speed

00:15:00.665 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:90%
as the 47th story.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
This can only be accomplished
by means of explosives.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
This is what you call a
controlled demolition.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:84%
That is when you are taking
down skyscrapers on purpose.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You bring in explosives, you put
the explosives in the building.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And this has been done-- it
has to be done very accurately.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:90%
This is expert work.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And the collapse of World
Trade Center, the controlled

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
demolitions of
World Trade Center

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:90%
are masterpieces in engineering.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
They're-- it's so
brilliantly performed.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
No building--
Building 7, 30% higher

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
than any building which, at
that time, had been demolished.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And the twin towers, of
course, three times higher

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:90%
than any building at that time.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:90%
It would be different.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But the story of the
mechanism for the demolition

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
of the twin towers is different
from that of Building 7

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
which everybody can see just
from watching the videos.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But nobody has seen
Building Seven,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
as I started to tell you.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not shown on
mainstream television.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So most people have not
seen Building Seven.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And already, at that
point, I mean you

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and many other
people may have had

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:84%
problems with the
physics classes

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and the chemistry classes.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher was not
very good eventually

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't understand
a thing and all

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:90%
this mathematics stuff, OK.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:90%
But we can all count to three.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So already from the fact that
there were two airliners,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
but there were three skyscrapers
collapsing on that day.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can count
to three, can we?

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Already from this fact,
you should realize

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
that there is something wrong.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.635 align:middle line:84%
And the way it is
collapsing is unambiguously

00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
a controlled demolition.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And this can only be done
by means of explosives

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and something else which
is called incendiaries.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:84%
We know about World Trade Center
that it is-- that actually

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
the steel columns were cut in--
by other means than explosives,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
but explosives were used.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It is-- it is necessary for
accomplishing this completely

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
symmetrical and this free
fall feature of its collapse

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
This, I repeat, this
requires that at that moment,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
all supporting structure
of the building is gone.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And since it's falling
completely symmetrically,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
it means that it's
gone at the same time.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no way around this.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why maybe somebody
don't show Building 7.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:07.060 align:middle line:84%
It's really the Achilles's
heel or, what you would say?

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
The smoking gun.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: And that building,
it was--was it 5 o'clock?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Or much later?

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: It was 20
minutes past 5 o'clock

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
which means that--
now, we can go--

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
of course there's been a lot
of speculation and discussion.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said that-- that
when the Twin Towers were

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:84%
collapsing, and we're
talking about 350,000

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:90%
tons of concrete and steel.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is like
a little earthquake.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It would be no surprise, say,
if the foundation of Building

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Seven had been damaged, OK?

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And maybe some of the debris
which is being thrown out

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of the towers would have--
would have-- would have-- would

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you say, compromised
Building Seven to an extent

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:90%
that it would fall.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the first
response to that

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
would be would that be
reasonable to expect

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:90%
with a seven hour delay?

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Building
Seven had collapsed

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
due to shaking in
the ground, you would

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:90%
expect an immediate action.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And-- but most
tellingly, actually,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the official report
on the Building Seven collapse

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:84%
which came out of an
institution which is called

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:84%
the National Institute of
Standards and Technology,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:90%
abbreviated NIST.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.650 align:middle line:84%
This report from
NIST in that they--

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
they themselves
exclude what we call

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:84%
mechanical damage
of Building Seven

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.190 align:middle line:90%
as a cause for its collapse.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That means the
official account do

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
not-- the official
report does not

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
count on any physical
damage of Building 7.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing
you could rule out.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
There's been a lot of-- of
course many speculation.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Other-- another
bloom, as we call it,

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
which was launched
in intermediate years

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:90%
was the diesel tanks.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They had storage tanks for
the power emergency supplies.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
There were diesel
tanks in the basement.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said, well,
the diesel tanks, they

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:90%
fed the fires.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you had.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
It was an inferno of fires.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
NIST themselves rule
out this possibility

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:90%
for different technical reasons.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So NIST claims that Building
7 fell due to ordinary office

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
fires, which there
were ordinary office--

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:90%
office fires in the building.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
But it was not a
roaring inferno.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
There were random, small office
fires on six floors after two

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the problem
with that explanation

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
is that it has-- there
are several problems.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But what should be
appreciated by everyone

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
is that it has never happened
before or after in history

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that a steel frame high
riser-- and that is wha-- how--

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:90%
what you call such a building.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:90%
We don't have them in Denmark.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:90%
We only use concrete.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But a steel frame high risesr--
that means a high riser built

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
around a steel skeleton--
buildings around this design

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:39.515 align:middle line:84%
has never collapsed due to fire,
neither before or afterwards.

00:21:39.515 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there have
been hundreds of fires

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:90%
in buildings like that.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
have a fire in a high riser,

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
it means that the
firefighters, they come.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:90%
They go into the building.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The go to the floors
where the fires are.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And they put out the fires.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And firefighters,
they are brave.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
They are courageous,
but they're not stupid.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And they're not suicidal.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
They know that
buildings like that

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:90%
do not collapse due to fire.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And if, again, I may bring
in a scientific principle.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Each fire which there's
been in a steel frame high

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
riser you could,
maybe cynically,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:90%
consider as an experiment.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And after each fire,
you make the observation

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the building did not collapse.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
When you've see this
100, 200, 300 times,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:84%
you draw the conclusion the
steel frame high risers simply

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.020 align:middle line:90%
do not collapse due to fire.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.415 align:middle line:84%
And still, NIST,
National Institute

00:22:42.415 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
of Standards and
Technology, claim

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that this happened for the
first, single, and only

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.380 align:middle line:90%
time in history on that day.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Already from there, you
know that their report is

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
a fraud, a scientific cover up.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the scientists
can go into the report which

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:84%
is huge, and point to all of the
mistakes, all the errors, all

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the deliberate omissions,
all the lies, and all

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
the dead meat, all
the hot air which

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:84%
is in these reports
and point out all--

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is an academic
pastime really.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Because basically,
in sum, we must

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:84%
characterized the
official, technical reports

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.245 align:middle line:90%
as scientific fraud.

00:23:39.245 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:90%
They're lying.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It is-- and this institute
I'm talking about

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is not an independent
academic institution.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
It is operating under
the Ministry of Commerce

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
the-- the-- the leadership

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is appointed each time you
shift a new administration,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
you have a new leadership.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, the-- the--
the control of this institution

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
was tightened up immediately
when George W. Bush--

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:90%
W. Bush came in-- into office.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Tell us about
some of the-- the-- the debris

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
that you have found
or that were reported,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:90%
particularly, this red chip.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: This
is more-- actually,

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:84%
is an academic
footnote, because once--

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
what I've told you is that, I
cannot account for all of it,

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
but there are a whole
range of observations,

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
physics and chemistry,
which each of them imply

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the World Trade Center was taken
down in controlled demolitions.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Now then, you can
start to speculate,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:90%
actually, how it was done.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And-- and one thing that you
use in controlled demolition,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:90%
of course, are explosives.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
means to cut steel beams,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and that is by means
of incendiaries.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And an incendiary is-- is--
is an energetic material which

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
works by means of heat
while an explosive

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:90%
works by means of pressure.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Explose-- explosives,
they knock things apart.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:84%
But you can also destruct--
destruct material, buildings,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.080 align:middle line:90%
armor by means of heat.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
That is, you're bringing
in a charge which

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
is-- eventually is so
hot that you simply

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:90%
burn your way through it.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This is called an
incendiary, and it's

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
based on a chemical reaction
called the thermite reaction.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Steven E. Jones--
everybody who has

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
seen the collapse
of the Twin Towers

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, if
they are informed,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
also the collapse
of Building Seven

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
observe that these
collapses was accompanied

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:90%
by huge dust clouds.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And that-- actually, that's
another observation which

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
points to controlled
demolition, because these dust

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:16.110 align:middle line:84%
clouds expand in a fashion which
you only see from volcanoes.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:90%
It was not ordinary dust clouds.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.040 align:middle line:90%
They were burning hot.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
People were actually
getting burns

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.810 align:middle line:84%
from being exposed
to these dust clouds,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there is something
very special going on here.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything was pulverized
from all three skyscrapers

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.480 align:middle line:90%
except for the steel.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
turned into-- now,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the first responders
and the cleanup workers,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
they reported that
the biggest chunk I--

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I've-- I've found was-- was
the keyboard of a telephone.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything was pulverized.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, the remains of
human beings-- they

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:90%
were absolutely nothing left.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
They were finding tiny, tiny
fractures of human bones

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:07.200 align:middle line:84%
on the roofs of-- of-- of--
of the neighboring buildings.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
On the rooftops
of Deutsche Bank,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:84%
actually many years later, they
found fractured bone fragments.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So meaning, this
alone, I'm just--

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.600 align:middle line:90%
there's so many observations.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
This alone means that
these poor people

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
were not caught by the falling
masses of the building.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.790 align:middle line:90%
They would blown apart.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So everything,
including the people,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.890 align:middle line:90%
were completely pulverized.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So there were
hundreds of thousands

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:84%
of tons of what we
call World Trade

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Center dust sprayed all over the
southern Manhattan on that day.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And this dust was
characterized very

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:84%
early on, actually,
by a private company

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:90%
called the RJ Lee Group.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And their report-- first
report came out in 2003,

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:90%
another report in 2004.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:84%
United States Geological
Survey in California,

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:84%
they came out also
with a characterization

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.420 align:middle line:90%
of the dust in 2005.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And from these reports--
Steven E. Jones,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I just mentioned him,
looked into these reports.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And there were some observations
which was just outrageous.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And in some pointed to
the-- to the occurrence

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of extremely high temperatures
during the collapses

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.750 align:middle line:90%
of this building.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Among other things, you
find-- you find in the dust

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:48.590 align:middle line:84%
some very tiny, completely
round spheres of iron.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't find this in
ordinary building dust.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And this points
to the application

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of thermite which I've just
explained and mentioned.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And what-- and
other observations

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.940 align:middle line:90%
pointing in the same direction.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But the short and long
story is that Jones,

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:84%
in late 2006 that
we have to look

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:90%
into-- further into the dust.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe there's
something left.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
When you have explosions or
when you apply incendiaries,

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.640 align:middle line:90%
the reaction is never complete.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
There's always something left.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have an act of terrorism
or whenever people are using

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:84%
explosives, the police come to
the crime site and they can--

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
they can-- there are
always something left.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They can identify what
kind of explosive was used.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So Jones speculated
maybe there's

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
some unreactive thermite
left, so he took

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
a closer look into the dust.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, he found, what
we call, red-gray chips.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm using-- I'm
holding up my finger here,

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is, most of them--
they're less than a millimeter.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You need a microscope,
actually, to see them.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, you need a
magnet, because they

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
are attracted by-- by a magnet.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So what you do, you apply
a magnet to the dust.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:90%
You get out something.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what you get out are
also these small iron spheres.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:90%
They're magnetic.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But with them also, eventually,
if you look under a microscope,

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:90%
you see these small chips.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a form--
a team of scientists

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:90%
to investigate these chips.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to join this
team and was on board,

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:84%
not on the initial findings
which was done by Jones alone,

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:84%
but by-- in the characterization
and the investigation

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:90%
of these chips.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It led to a
scientific publication

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.940 align:middle line:90%
which came out in April 2009.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And the main conclusion here
is that these chips are-- were

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:84%
unreacted thermitic
material, that is,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:84%
when you take it
and-- and heat it up.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
At some point, at
some temperature, 430

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.310 align:middle line:90%
degrees centigrade, it reacts.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And it forms the same iron
spheres which has been found

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:22.460 align:middle line:90%
in abundance in the bulk dust.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is unreactive
thermitic material.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And I use this very
vague term intentionally,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:84%
because there's been a
lot of misunderstanding,

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:90%
actually, about this finding.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I told you that we know that
incindiaries were used--

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
we know that the
thermite has been used

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:90%
for cutting the steel beams.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not the red-gray
chips material.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I don't believe it.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
explosives were used.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And the confusion comes in
because what we are talking

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:84%
about here is what,
in a broad term

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is called energetic materials,
and the thermite reaction

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.210 align:middle line:90%
has a lot of energy in it.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.980 align:middle line:90%
But it's-- it is slow.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Explosives are not-- are
not particularly energetic.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:84%
People-- many people
might think that you have

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.600 align:middle line:90%
a lot of energy in explosives.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.300 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:35.150 align:middle line:84%
The point about explosives is
that their reaction is so fast.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:37.095 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very quick.

00:32:37.095 --> 00:32:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So-- and you develop
a gas super fast.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
the explosion effect.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So in the early 90s
research started

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:84%
to try to get the
chemical energy

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:84%
from the thermite reaction and
convert it into an explosive.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- this is the
emergence of nanotechnology

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.390 align:middle line:84%
which is a phrase which most
people have heard of at least.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The point here being is that
you can bring particles.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You can make them so small that
you are actually approaching

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:84%
molecular dimensions, meaning
that if you have two reactants

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:84%
who have to react, when
the particles are so small,

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
you can get them much
more intimately mixed.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can have the
thermite reaction running

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:90%
as fast as an explosive.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you then add other
chemicals to the material,

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.980 align:middle line:84%
you can produce a
gas, meaning that you

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:51.980 align:middle line:84%
are getting the best of two
worlds in modern explosives.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:84%
You're getting the
best of two worlds.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You're getting the energy
from the thermite reaction

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.255 align:middle line:84%
and-- but it's running
so fast that you

00:33:58.255 --> 00:33:59.860 align:middle line:90%
are making an explosive.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So the principle of the thermite
reaction, and we know this,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.080 align:middle line:84%
can be applied for
developing explosives.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And just the other day,
actually two weeks ago,

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
we found a patent from 1993
from Lawrence Livermore National

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory whether actually
patenting explosives based

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:84%
on this technology-- not
exactly the same thing

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.819 align:middle line:84%
as we found in the
red-gray chips.

00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:34.639 align:middle line:84%
The point being, and
that's the only point,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:41.449 align:middle line:84%
is that the thermite reaction
can be used for developing

00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:84%
explosives, but we
do not know actually

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
what kind of explosives were
used in World Trade Center.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: But idea of it
being caused by the plane

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and-- is totally,
totally absurd to you.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:10%
NIELS HARRIT:
That's totally out.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:10%
I-- I consider on
that conclusion,

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:08.120 align:middle line:10%
I consider scientific
mainstream.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is that
nobody dares to talk about it,

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
very, very bad career

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.970 align:middle line:84%
move at all at a university
to-- to raise these questions.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:24.660 align:middle line:84%
All American universities
are dependent on government

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:90%
funding.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't talk
about these things,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.688 align:middle line:90%
not even at the lunch table.

00:35:31.688 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:10%
And Stephen Jones was
forced, actually-- he was

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.570 align:middle line:10%
forced into early retirement.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Not kicked out.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:90%
I think he struck a fair deal.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And I must say-- I must
say that Brigham Young

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
University, actually,
in the course of events

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:90%
were not unfair.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we had access to
all the equipment there,

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and they had a
beautiful microscope.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.340 align:middle line:84%
This-- now I'm talking-- I'm
talking about instruments

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.227 align:middle line:90%
which is of course--

00:36:06.227 --> 00:36:07.659 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Your toys.
NIELS HARRIT: Yeah.

00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- which is-- which
is actually decisive for--for

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:90%
doing this kind of research.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a good
instrument at Copenhagen,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:90%
but at that time we didn't.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But the instrument at that time
which they had at Brigham Young

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:84%
was very good and a very
good man operating it.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.660 align:middle line:90%
And he's still there.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So-- so actually, so Jones
had access to the equipment.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It was done on Brigham Young.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.840 align:middle line:84%
They actually had
the opportunity

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to read our publication
prior to submission.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So they got the final word.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And-- and-- and they also
came with some reservations

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.000 align:middle line:84%
which I actually was
quite happy about.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there were nine
authors on this--on this paper.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And you may imagine
one guy's in Australia,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sitting in
Copenhagen. There

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of discussion
going back and forth

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:11.940 align:middle line:90%
when we were writing it up.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other
guys were more--

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:24.525 align:middle line:84%
wanted to, what should I say,
point more to the implications

00:37:24.525 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of our findings.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I wanted it to--
should be strictly scientific.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.035 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we should just
tell about our findings,

00:37:35.035 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:90%
our conclusions, and that's it.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
roughly the same

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.900 align:middle line:90%
as Brigham Young asked us to do.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Just to report the facts.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually
happy with what--

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:90%
with this-- with Brigham Young.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:90%
They were fair.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:90%
There were fair.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I certainly understand
the problems

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.200 align:middle line:84%
of any academic institution
in the United States

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
or in Denmark or anywhere in the
Western hemisphere, actually,

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:90%
when dealing with these matters.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, for the record,
that Brigham Young acted

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:84%
honestly and decently
in this-- under the--

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:90%
under the circumstances.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But Jones were-- went
into premature retirement.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm a little bit older.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.620 align:middle line:84%
My-- my point is that I'm saying
that for young scientists-- all

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling my colleagues
here, stay out of this.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a very bad career move.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:84%
If you have children
or if you're depending

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:90%
on your salary, don't move.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:90%
All this--

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: All this
has an implication

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:84%
on your personal life, on
your professional life.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Standing in the truth
and what we believe in

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is a big one for
a lot of people.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT:
Yeah, that's right.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and in
scientific community

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.125 align:middle line:84%
it's a very bad
career move to raise

00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:09.920 align:middle line:90%
your voice on the 9/11 issue.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a-- it's a--
it's a bloody shame,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and it is actually-- maybe
we should talk about that.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
The-- the-- the university
of the-- the academia

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:26.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Western hemisphere
is maybe it is dead.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
what we in Europe

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:90%
call the Humboldt University.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And the name refers to
a German geographer.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's a Humboldt
current south of South

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.400 align:middle line:90%
America which is in his name.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was president of
this university in Berlin

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and has given name
to universities

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.640 align:middle line:84%
as we used to know
them, as free havens

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
for thinking and knowledge
and speech, of course.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And it has served us very,
very well for 200 years.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's good business, actually,
to have places where people are

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.120 align:middle line:84%
just accumulating
knowledge and understanding

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and eventually rolling
out the principles,

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:84%
talk about natural
science, which then,

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
50 years later is going into
technological innovation.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It is under threat
now, and I would

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.190 align:middle line:90%
even say that it's eliminated.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because academia is
being controlled now.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:84%
There are different
mechanisms for how

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:90%
this control is executed.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
We had a new law, actually,
for-- for governance of

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:90%
the Danish universities 2003.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Up to that point.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:84%
The University of
Copenhagen is from 1488.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the next
oldest university in Europe.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The oldest one I think
is in Bologna, in Italy.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So but we are from 1488
and from 1488 to 2003,

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
the university has
been self-governing,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:90%
self-ruling-- how do say it?

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Self-administration.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Independent.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.000 align:middle line:90%
We have elected our own leaders.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.350 align:middle line:84%
In 2003, it has been
ruled by the government.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- has happening all
over in the Western societies.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.120 align:middle line:90%
That's one mechanism.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The other mechanism
lies in the funding,

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:90%
where the money comes from.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So what I see now is all my
young colleagues literally

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
applying for their
own salary which makes

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.390 align:middle line:90%
them-- nobody rocks the boat.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So don't expect academia to
come out and speak for truth.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:90%
You pay a price.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:57.547 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Let's go back
to this event in the ashes.

00:41:57.547 --> 00:41:58.480 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: OK, I'm sorry.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.043 align:middle line:90%
LILOU MACE: No-- no-- no.

00:42:00.043 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing to apologize for.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.990 align:middle line:84%
This is-- this is-- this
is-- this is excellent.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:09.110 align:middle line:84%
But going back to the-- to
the ashes and the impact

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:84%
it has on our
health, on the people

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that were there
and the-- the-- not

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
just the content
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.536 align:middle line:90%
but-- but-- the-- yeah.

00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:18.590 align:middle line:90%
The health impact.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:19.290 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: Yeah.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:23.880 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing,
because the red-gray chips

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
is-- is a tiny, tiny fraction
of the World Trade Center dust.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The bulk dust is not-- is
very, very bad for breathing.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you-- you should see
the dust under a microscope,

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and you'd just say gosh.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The poor people who was
breathing this stuff.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.300 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: And there
was a lot of it.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We saw a lot of pictures
of-- of many, many people

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.285 align:middle line:90%
just covered-- covered.

00:42:50.285 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So thick.
NIELS HARRIT: Yeah.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And in particularly, the
main target group is what

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:90%
you call the first responders.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.590 align:middle line:84%
This is between 60,000 and
70,000 people who came rushing,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and there's some stories
which are just heartbreaking.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.160 align:middle line:84%
People living in
Pennsylvania or Maryland,

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.380 align:middle line:84%
jumping into their
cars, driving,

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
miles, to New York City,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and rushing to the site to help.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were working around
the clock for days, for weeks,

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to help people
find in the rubble.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
breathing in this stuff.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
first responders.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there were all
the firemen, all the policemen,

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:36.260 align:middle line:90%
all the workers on the site.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Many, many thousands
of these people

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:42.960 align:middle line:84%
have come-- become ill because
of breathing this stuff.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It is toxic and poisonous
for a variety of reasons.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
pulverized concrete is--

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.361 align:middle line:84%
I have to use a technical
term now-- it's very--

00:43:54.361 --> 00:43:55.847 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Steel.
Pulverized steel.

00:43:55.847 --> 00:43:56.680 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: No, no, no.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.680 align:middle line:84%
No, the steel was
not pulverized.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:90%
The concrete.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:84%
There were concrete slabs in
the building, namely the floors.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:90%
They were concrete.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.310 align:middle line:90%
They didn't carry anything.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:90%
But the floors were concrete.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.710 align:middle line:90%
It was completely pulverized.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Pulverized concrete-- it's
about 90,000 tons per tower.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Pulverized concrete
is very basic which

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:84%
means that it actually burns the
lungs when you're breathing it.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
threshold from-- from

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
above which you characterize
this kind of dust as unhealthy.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And below this it is
characterized as healthy.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the agency's the
Environmental Protection

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Agency, they deliberately
falsified the samples,

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and actually took it
to get the measurement

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.380 align:middle line:90%
below the threshold.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.170 align:middle line:84%
That means that they
lied about the health.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
But this was a report which
came out later, of course,

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.260 align:middle line:84%
in the days when
these things happen.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The Environmental
Protection Agency, they

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:02.120 align:middle line:90%
launched 11 what would you say?

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Decoration statements that the
air was healthy to breathe,

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because they wanted
to reopen Wall Street.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But another thing-- and-- and--
and-- other poisonous things

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:84%
in the dust is pulverized
glass, glass fibers, asbestos.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it myself.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It's called chrysotile.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
asbestos fibers in the dust.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, all other
metals, and, of course,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.960 align:middle line:90%
all other kind of chemicals.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.660 align:middle line:90%
It's simply not very healthy.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And these people
are getting ill.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I must say-- and they have
fought for more than 10 years

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:55.940 align:middle line:84%
to have medical support,
to have-- these people,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.140 align:middle line:84%
they're taking maybe
50 different kind

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:90%
of-- of medicine each day.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.400 align:middle line:90%
They can't breathe.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:10.150 align:middle line:84%
They're dying from very
special kind of cancers related

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:90%
to the lungs and et cetera.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Recently, Congress have just
passed an act, actually,

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.840 align:middle line:84%
according to which these
people are getting medical aid,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.910 align:middle line:84%
but it has taken them
10 years of fight

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to actually-- to get just
their-- their-- medical demands

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:90%
covered.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And it will be taken away
immediately, it's in the act,

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:84%
if they raise their voice in
criticism of the government

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or if they, by any other
means, are characterized as,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:90%
should we say, misbehaving?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:84%
That is, if any of these
people stand up and testify,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:84%
their medical support is
taken away immediately,

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and we are talking about
people who are lethally ill.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.910 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:13.070 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: I--I know your
background is-- is science.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.120 align:middle line:90%
But why would this happen?

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Why would the US say
government wants that?

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Why would they--
why such an event?

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Such a moment,
such a day has been

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:26.070 align:middle line:90%
orchestrated and worked on.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:90%
NIELS HARRIT: Oh this is.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.415 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: We have
to talk about it.

00:47:28.415 --> 00:47:31.050 align:middle line:84%
NIELS HARRIT: Yeah, OK, but
this is beyond, you would say,

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.980 align:middle line:90%
my mandate here.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I am here, first of all,
as a concerned scientist.

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm-- I'm presenting--
I'm presenting evidence.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The only way where the human
and the grandfather comes in

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is that I can say,
I'm opposed to crime.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And killing 3,000 people,
I think, is a crime.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But the event has never been
investigated as a crime.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.950 align:middle line:84%
There has been no
criminal investigation.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There has been no
with suprema power.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:15.680 align:middle line:84%
There's been-- usually, when
you investigate a crime,

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
the police comes in, and they
find some evidence which they

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.680 align:middle line:90%
are presented for a grand jury.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And you come up with charges.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.000 align:middle line:90%
You charge somebody.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.310 align:middle line:84%
You take them in or you-- you
want them for-- for trial.

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.130 align:middle line:90%
You-- you go to court.

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:38.530 align:middle line:90%
You have a trial.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're either
guilty or not guilty.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.470 align:middle line:90%
This has never happened.

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:49.220 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen any
evidence for the truth

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.280 align:middle line:90%
of the official account.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It has never been
investigated as a crime.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Osama bin Laden has never
been wanted for 9/11.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You may not believe
this, but it's true.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:03.140 align:middle line:90%
He's never been wanted for 9/11.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.360 align:middle line:84%
At some point, in 2005
I think, a journalist--

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.230 align:middle line:90%
his name was Ed Haas.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
He called FBI and say,
hey, why aren't Osama

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.480 align:middle line:90%
bin Laden wanted for 9/11?

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And the spokesman from
FBI, his name was Rex Tomb,

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:24.580 align:middle line:84%
he said quite bluntly
because FBI does not

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.660 align:middle line:84%
have any hard
evidence connecting

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Osama bin Laden with the event.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a truth and they're
quite blunt about it.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.950 align:middle line:90%
You go to-- now this.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:90%
They say that they killed him.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But if-- if you-- you--
you can see the most

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:46.440 align:middle line:90%
wanted persons from FBI website.

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Osama bin Laden, he was wanted
for the attacks in East Africa

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and Dar es Salaam
and Nairobi, I think,

00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and the American embassies, and
for the USS Cole event in Aden.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He was not wanted for
9/11, because they

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:90%
did not have any hard evidence.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- so I-- my
only-- you may say political.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I will say ethical
demand here-- is

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that we should have a forensic
criminal investigation

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.780 align:middle line:90%
of the crime.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Well, thank you,
Niels for this interview.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for showing up.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.341 align:middle line:84%
Thank you to the Danish.
NIELS HARRIT: Yeah.

00:50:33.341 --> 00:50:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You're welcome.
Thanks a lot.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.401 align:middle line:84%
LILOU MACE: Much
love from Denmark.

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Bye.
Thank you for watching.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.934 align:middle line:90%
