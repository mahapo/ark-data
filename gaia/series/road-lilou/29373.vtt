00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello, this
is Lilou for Gaiam TV.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Malmo today in the
south of Sweden with Yvonne.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.515 align:middle line:84%
>>YVONNE FRANK
MANSSON: Hello, Lilou.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How are
you doing today?

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Oh,
I'm very, very well.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.729 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hot
here in Sweden today.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Well, this
is a good thing,

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
because it's been raining
quite a lot recently.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:10%
So thank god for
the warm weather.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%
And we're here in the
magnificent harbor of Malmo--

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:10%
a beautiful city.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm just discovering how
beautiful it actually is.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm excited to speak with you
because you're a publisher here

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:10%
in Sweden of some special books.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:10%
And you have a special story.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.077 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's inspiring.

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:10%
So this is quite
different from usual,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.515 align:middle line:10%
but this is powerful messages
that you are receiving.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.672 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Messages of love.

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
Of course of love.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:10%
And yesterday, to start,
getting in contact

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:10%
with your universal family and
understand who you actually

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:10%
are, because you are a
divine human being here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:10%
on the beautiful
planet of Mother Earth

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:10%
to transmit and send all
your love energy further,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:10%
because people
need respect today.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:84%
We need this humble
feeling of each other.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
care of each other.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And we have to start right now.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:90%
So please accept your life.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Feel trust.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And get in touch with
your inner source.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And the divine forces will
get in touch with you.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of it.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.904 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, because for you,
this is the interesting thing.

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get into it because I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
think it's important
in this conversation.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
More and more people speak
about channeling or automatic

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%
writing.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:90%
And you had this experience.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened for you,
where you were in your life

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.114 align:middle line:84%
when this happened,
and how you reacted,

00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
because some people
think they're crazy.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
But no, you're not crazy.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
This is happening all around
the world, in Sweden, too.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.235 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:14.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
channeling today.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
universe are calling us.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And we have forgotten to
get in contact with them.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's why so many people
get this channeling gift.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it happened
because I have asked for it.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
My whole life, I
have asked for it.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.155 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know what it meant.

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.305 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: What were you asking?

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:43.374 align:middle line:90%
To be in contact?

00:02:43.374 --> 00:02:44.040 align:middle line:90%
To be connected?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.914 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.115 align:middle line:84%
I always have this
feeling that there

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
is something more that you
can't see with your eyes.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:10%
And I have felt it in my body.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Since I was a kid, I had
this talk to Mother Earth.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And I know there is so much
more to find out about us,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:10%
but what I didn't
learn in school.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:10%
So I have searched.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:10%
I have read all the
books, you know.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.235 align:middle line:10%
And I have given up, too.

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:10%
I have given up
and tried to work

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.256 align:middle line:10%
in this society with
all their rules.

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:10%
But no, I couldn't do that.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:10%
So we went to in the middle
of Sweden, in the north,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:10%
at Lake Siljan, who is--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: North of
Stockholm, two hours north

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:10%
or something of Stockholm?

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.646 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yeah.

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Three hours north of Stockholm.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.790 align:middle line:10%
It's a beautiful place with
a lot of force, energy.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.375 align:middle line:10%
And there, suddenly, one evening
in the middle of the snow,

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.186 align:middle line:10%
in the winter, I get
automatical writing.

00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Automatic writing,
your hands start to take off.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.072 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You had tried
that before, to do so?

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Never.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:10%
I had wished for
it, but I think,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:10%
I am not the right person.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:10%
It's for everyone
else, but not me.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.722 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So on that
day, what was different?

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
We had the meeting

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:10%
with nine people who
were very spiritual.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:10%
We had meditate.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:10%
And we were in a lovely mood.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.496 align:middle line:10%
And I asked to get activated
with automatical writing.

00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Oh, la, la.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:10%
I've got shivers.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: I asked for it.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, my hand
started to write.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:10%
And I cried and I didn't
think, what's this?,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:10%
because it was not my words.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:10%
It was something else.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And 13 pages were written.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:10%
And they told me how
to start this group

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:10%
with channeling messages.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.730 align:middle line:10%
And it is like this.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:10%
Do you know was the
soul, the beings of light

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.730 align:middle line:10%
wanted to help us to waking
up, to see our divine force.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:10%
But we haven't heard them.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:10%
We haven't listened
to our heart enough.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:10%
And that evening,
they reached me.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:10%
And they asked, can you please
help to get our messages out

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:10%
to the people who want to read?

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:10%
Because we can't do anything
about-- against the free will

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:10%
of humanity.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:10%
You have to decide
by yourself if you

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:10%
want to work for
the light or not.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And if you decide with
your heart, not your brain,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:10%
that you want to be a light
worker, to be good-- whatever

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:10%
happens, you stay
good-- then, of course,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.370 align:middle line:10%
you meet a lot of
resistance, hard times,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:10%
because you've chosen it.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:10%
And all of those hard
times, all the resistance

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:10%
that you meet-- they
are to treasure.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And when you find and
understand that and that

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.190 align:middle line:10%
when you accept
everything in your life,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:10%
you find your own
treasure, your own force.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.600 align:middle line:10%
From there, you can start to
be a light being for everyone,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:10%
because then you can forgive.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.702 align:middle line:10%
Then you can forgive
everything you see.

00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Even the
suffering in the world.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.285 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:10%
And you can't help everyone.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:10%
But you can help them
who you're meeting

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:10%
with your love, and most
of all, without words.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.149 align:middle line:90%
Just be.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: By our presence.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That's
funny, because that's

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.281 align:middle line:84%
what the dolphins were teaching
me in Hawaii when I was there

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:38.823 align:middle line:90%
around Kawai.

00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:40.072 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: That's right.

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They understand.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:90%
They are very intelligent.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
so intelligent, too.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've got a lot of
messages, divine messages.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me
to send them out

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:90%
to people who want to read them.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a-- with
help from my friends,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
we started a website,
and I wrote messages--

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I received messages
every day for one year.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then a lovely man
came in my way and said,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I help you to print the
book, the first book.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Wow-- because I had no money.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And in a couple of months, I
had the first book, and then

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the second book, and
then the third book,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and then other
authors coming my way.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And I helped them to
print their books,

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
all channeling books
with divine messages

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
so the people can awake and
start working by themself.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Who are these
people getting in touch

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:90%
with beings on the planet?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Who are they from
your understanding?

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Because some people receive
different connections,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess, depending on
their soul group, possibly.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: I
think all those people

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
who have suffering a
lot in their lives, who

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:84%
have trust their life,
whatever happening,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and who were seeking for
more love in the society.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They have opened some
channel, and they understand,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
someone is knocking
on my inner door.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I have to open it.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to
explain with words,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's so fine drawn
signs that you are receiving.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And first, you don't
understand them.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
You're afraid of them.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:90%
But you can't hide.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to be that mission
that you are here for.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And these days, a lot of
people are awakening up

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.710 align:middle line:84%
to show the way
for other peoples

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:84%
who are seeking
their way to love,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
way to heal the world.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
It's with our love
and understanding,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and to forgive, first of all,
ourselves, and then the rest.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they are doing,
just forgive and accept.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And those messages
are coming from whom for you?

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: It started
with a group who were actually

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.110 align:middle line:90%
human beings 100 years ago.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And they got a message
from other side

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to connect with people
who want to help them

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.040 align:middle line:90%
with these messages.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But very soon, they
thanked for them and said,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
now, we are going further, and
you are going to another level.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And my whole body went
sick for one week.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was dying because
all the cells in the body

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.001 align:middle line:90%
were--

00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:35.708 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Buzzing.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
Yes, transmitted.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:10%
And my heart was
aching and my body-- I

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:10%
couldn't leave my
bed for one week.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:10%
But then I understand,
oh, my god.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm really activating
and transforming

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:10%
a new level in my body.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:10%
And then they started to talk.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:10%
It was a higher level.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: How did you knew
it was a higher level?

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: They presented
themselves like light beings.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:10%
They call themselves
atalamda lights.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:10%
And actually, one evening when
I was alone at home, writing,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:10%
I saw one.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:10%
One visited me with
my physical eyes.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:10%
He was seven, eight meter high,
light, vibrating, flowing.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:10%
And he just walked by my
window, and with no words.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:10%
He just said, trust.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:10%
Trust life.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:10%
And I cried.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:10%
And they were telling me a lot
of stuff and a lot of messages.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And they are in my second book.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And every message is
like a key for you.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And you, as a reader, decide
if you want to use them or not.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no obligations.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:90%
There is no rules.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just the messages,
be who you are.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank for everything, accept,
and send this transmission

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.805 align:middle line:90%
further to everyone you meet.

00:11:10.805 --> 00:11:13.544 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.544 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us more
about those keys--

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
if you can share some
of them or remember.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you apply them
as much as possible.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: I have got,
I think, 700 or 800 messages.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.362 align:middle line:90%
And they are all different.

00:11:26.362 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Then we'll trust that
whatever comes through right

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
now will be the right
ones for us to hear.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: But they
all have something in common.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is just everything
starts with yourself.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the start point.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn to
love every part of yourself.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to thank for everything
in your life that you meet,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:90%
especially the hard times.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to accept who you are.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do what your
heart is telling you to do.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a mix between your brain,
your heart, and your soul.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you find this mixing
part, this triangle inside you,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
the life will be so
synchronicity-ed.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
You meet the right people.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.295 align:middle line:84%
You are finding yourself
in the right position

00:12:20.295 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and in the right situation.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:90%
And you feel you have a mission.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:10%
It can be so simple.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.412 align:middle line:10%
It can be to just call one
person who you know are sick.

00:12:31.412 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:90%
But that's enough.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:90%
You're doing something.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You are going to act,
not just thinking.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:90%
You're handling.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But then all the
messages is telling you

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:52.967 align:middle line:84%
about the eternity life,
the life when you not

00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
are in a body on the
planet, to tell you

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of how we are exploring
ourselves here on Earth,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of beings
wish to go to this planet

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:90%
to get this exhibition.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:90%
No--

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.915 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.915 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Shift?

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: No,
evolution, actually.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.312 align:middle line:90%
Evolution.

00:13:23.312 --> 00:13:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: They want to
help us in our evolution?

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes,
they want to help us

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:10%
to-- we have to make it quicker
now, because it's in a hurry.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:10%
But we will manage it.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:10%
All our lives on
Earth is a school.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:10%
We know that.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.135 align:middle line:10%
But this life is maybe the
most important life ever

00:13:48.135 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:10%
that we are living, because now,
we are seeing that we are one.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:10%
Whatever you do, it
has effects on Earth.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:10%
And you have to start to act
as all the human beings are

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:10%
one with nature and with
life and the situation.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:10%
And in the messages,
they also tell us

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:10%
that we are goddess in school.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:10%
And in the next life, when
we're not anymore on Earth,

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:10%
we are going to start our
own universe by ourselves

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:10%
and make the life go
further in the evolution--

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:10%
not on Earth, but
in another universe.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:10%
There a lot of universe.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.525 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to explain, and
I know it sounds crazy.

00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: You're doing well.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:10%
Plus it's in English,
so thank you.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: It's crazy.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: A lot of people
speak of the multiverse

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:10%
and also that we have the whole
universe inside of us, too.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes, we have.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:10%
We are connected.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.260 align:middle line:10%
And we have to understand it.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
And they are calling on us.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But we have forgotten to
get in touch with them.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I am
having this activating

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
courses and published
books, because people

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
need to know that they
can do it by themself.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us about
the process of activating

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.622 align:middle line:84%
and of being able to
do this ourselves.

00:15:38.622 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: When
you're reading the books,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of practicing--
meditations and practicing

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
tests that you can do
by yourself at home.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot about
writing-- writing down

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
your bad sides, your
bad things in life.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Burn these papers
to get free of them.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And then start to write about
the good things in your life

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and start to give them
more time, notice,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and then to practice your love
to people with your thought.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to use words.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
You can think about people
and try to help them.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You can think about
situations in the world

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and try to help them--
situations in the nature.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And for example, now, in
Colorado, it's a lot of fire

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.010 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You can, with your heart, send
them all your love and respect.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
catastrophes in the world

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
are there because they want
to waken up the human beings,

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
because when there are
problems in the world,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
we are starting to
help each other.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And we don't care if you
are from another religion

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
or from another culture
or another country.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:90%
We help each other.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's because all those
terrible things happened.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure of that.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:90%
And they told me about it.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
It's sad, but it's the only way
to get in touch with each other

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and to start to help
those who need help.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So they told you about
some potential catastrophes

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.856 align:middle line:90%
on Earth going to happen?

00:17:25.856 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:90%
And we have seen them.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But they also tell me about a
new era, a new time, a new age.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in the horizon
if you look with your third eye

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
and with your heart.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:90%
You can see the light coming.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm working with.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with the trust
that it's a new light coming.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And all human hearts
are going bigger

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to receive all the
lights, because it's

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.030 align:middle line:84%
aching in your body
to receive this light.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It's transforming you.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
The whole body can feel
sick for a lot of days

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:90%
when you receive this light.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:90%
But don't be afraid.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Just breathe.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the universal
love and breathe it out

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to everything and
everyone you meet.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So we do need
to-- it's a co-creation.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:10%
And we need to actively,
from my understanding,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:10%
be there and want it
and ask for activation

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.095 align:middle line:10%
and be there, ready,
and opening our hearts.

00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And trust life.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
synchronicity time.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you need to do,
universe are sending it to you.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:90%
That's why you can trust life.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So the
universe is there

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to help us, not hurt against
us, because sometimes,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
in a bad situation,
we feel like, why me?

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Oh, yes.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us have
had a lot of bad times.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, when you think
about it, you got stronger.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Of course you got stronger.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:90%
You will stay alive.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And you will get a force.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that when other
people are in the hard times,

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
you understand them.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if you haven't
felt any bad times,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
you can't understand
other people.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:10%
You have to explore life.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you are seeking
for higher consciousness,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:10%
oh, you will get a
lot of trouble just

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:10%
to realize that those
trouble things in your life

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.180 align:middle line:10%
are your pearls in
your inner treasure.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So when things
hard happen to us,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.640 align:middle line:10%
the best is to be in gratitude.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:10%
And what else are
they telling you

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.370 align:middle line:10%
how to flip this around
to the good stuff?

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Write about it.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.860 align:middle line:10%
Write down-- what
you are feeling.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:10%
Accept all your feelings.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.264 align:middle line:10%
Don't--

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Decide.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: No, you
have to accept every feeling

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and let a feeling go
through you and then

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:10%
commit to the universe.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:10%
It is a hard thing, but you have
to give yourself to life fire.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:10%
And I tell myself
that every day.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.560 align:middle line:10%
Use me.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Use me for the love force.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Whatever happening, use me.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's free your mind.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:10%
That liberates your inner force.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And you see yourself in a
lot of fascinating situations

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:10%
when you do that.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.576 align:middle line:10%
But that's life.

00:21:00.576 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Tell us about Silja,
the spirit Silja than you

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:10%
were in touch with.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:10%
Is that through her, too?

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:10%
Or is that another
different kind of teachings?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:10%
Who is she?

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:10%
Who is it?

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: That's
a quite another energy.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:10%
It's a female energy from
the ever first moment

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:10%
when God was created.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:10%
God was created with
a female energy.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:10%
And she call herself
Silja in my book.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:10%
She is the flower of God.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And she is everywhere.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:90%
And she is everything.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And she's here, inside you,
everywhere, outside you.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
She's the female force
who are very creative.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And she can visualize
everything that you

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:90%
wish to achieve in your life.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:10%
And she knocked on my
inner window one night

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:10%
a couple of years
ago and asked if she

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:10%
can talk to me through
channeling, because she wants

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:10%
to give the people-- she
want to give them back

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:10%
to their own force--
divine force.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:10%
So I got these
messages from her.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very small
book, but so powerful.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:10%
And when you read it,
you find your own power,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:10%
without any help from others.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:10%
You find it by yourself.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:10%
That's the meaning of it.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:10%
You are doing all work
today by yourself.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.230 align:middle line:90%
You can listen to other people.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You can go workshops
and listen to them.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But the decision you made
by yourself every minute

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Silja
want to tell you.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.240 align:middle line:84%
You are in connection
with everything--

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
with the universal force,
with the divine force,

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and with Mother Earth.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Everything is connected.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can just pick
it up when you need it.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.605 align:middle line:90%
You are not alone.

00:23:10.605 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
You are a piece in
a very big system.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And you are surrounded with love
in every minute of your life.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Silja wants to
tell everyone who reads her.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.455 align:middle line:84%
She's an energy-- a
female, creative energy.

00:23:26.455 --> 00:23:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And the light
coming from the north--

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
because we hear it a lot, the
light comes from the north.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
What is your
understanding of it?

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.694 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: I have it
very easy explained for me.

00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: You're lucky.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:90%
You get everything answered.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
I need to travel
around the world

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.576 align:middle line:84%
personally and
get to the people,

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:48.450 align:middle line:84%
but you're actually
doing it from your living

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
room in pajamas.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes, I do--
accompanied with candles.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:10%
I asked one evening,
and they have told me

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:10%
in a lot of messages.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:10%
But once, you know, they told
me that at the north pole,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:10%
there is a very big gate.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:10%
And from there,
universe, divine force,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:10%
can get in touch with
human beings on Earth.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:10%
But you have to wish to get
this force with your heart,

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.650 align:middle line:10%
not with your brain,
with the heart.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:10%
And because of
all the people who

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:10%
are living in the north--
in Sweden, Norway, Denmark,

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:10%
Finland-- they are receiving
this force first, because they

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:10%
have chosen it in a pre-life--
to be the people who receive

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:10%
this light, and
then send it further

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:10%
in the world to
everyone they meet

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:10%
with their hearts-- no words, no
action, just with their hearts.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:09.831 align:middle line:84%
But now, lately, this
gate on north pole has--

00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Expanded.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.955 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
Yeah, expanding.

00:25:11.955 --> 00:25:13.070 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of new
energy are coming.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And again, we are aching.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Our bodies are aching.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:10%
That's because we are so tired.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:10%
We have problems
with our bodies.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:10%
We are feeling low,
because these new energies

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:10%
are transmitting the whole body.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And in the beginning,
we are tired.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:40.357 align:middle line:10%
But then, again, we get
a new energy in our body.

00:25:40.357 --> 00:25:41.190 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: An upgrade.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yeah, sure.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Upgrading your system.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:90%
That's very--

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: The DNA?

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:46.365 align:middle line:90%
Some people speak of--

00:25:46.365 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes, the
DNA, the cells-- everything

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
in your body are upgrading,
and also your consciousness.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
you are slowly

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:84%
getting a little bit
more intelligent,

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly, you
understand, my god, the ego

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:90%
is not to me.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:90%
I am not the ego.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I am not a body.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I am not my thoughts.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
I am light.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And I have to give it further.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.260 align:middle line:84%
That's my only mission
in life-- to be light

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and to give it further.

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are receiving
a lot of love light

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:84%
from the north pole, and that's
the light from the north.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish, later, I can
make an activation on you,

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.240 align:middle line:84%
because our brains
don't ever understand

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
what we are thinking
with our hearts.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we need
physical activation

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to understand with
our whole system.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:44.510 align:middle line:90%
So I do that.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.894 align:middle line:90%
And it's not difficult.

00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Everybody
can do it themselves.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can do it.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:90%
And you can spread it further.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And they who wish, they can
email me and get it on paper.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's a part of the
light from the north.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:10%
And that's to activate your
heart and your consciousness

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.730 align:middle line:10%
and put you in connection
with your universal family who

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:10%
wish to help you.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So is it part of
a declaration or a prayer?

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Or how do you--

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: No, it's
actually a statement,

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:10%
a symbol of the light
is coming into your body

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:10%
and getting in touch with
all your system inside you.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.725 align:middle line:10%
And it's a feeling.

00:27:31.725 --> 00:27:35.434 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.434 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: So the heart has to be
open to wanting to receive it,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:39.203 align:middle line:10%
too?

00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:40.202 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Mm-hmm.

00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And I am making a
little practice for you

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.580 align:middle line:10%
before so you get in touch with
Mother Earth and your crown

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:10%
chakra opening up
and everyone who

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:10%
needs to be there from the
universe will be there.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:58.890 align:middle line:10%
You'll see.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:27:59.145 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:27:59.145 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
No, I really look
forward to that.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:10%
So, do you have-- is there
a particular or other type

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.170 align:middle line:10%
of information that
you feel you're

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:10%
receiving from those teachings?

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm hearing that it's
a lot from the love.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:10%
But is there some
preparation for changes ahead

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.067 align:middle line:10%
or some things that we should
maybe know that you're aware of

00:28:24.067 --> 00:28:27.476 align:middle line:10%
and that you would
like to share today?

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:28.850 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
In the messages,

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:10%
they tell us don't think.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:10%
Don't be in the future.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:10%
Just be here right now.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
they don't tell me

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:10%
any things that actually
going to happen exactly

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:10%
in the future.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:10%
They just mention be aware.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.100 align:middle line:10%
Be now.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.470 align:middle line:10%
That's a very important
thought-- to be just now,

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.614 align:middle line:10%
not tomorrow, not
yesterday, just now.

00:28:55.614 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:10%
That's the important
thing, because everything

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.710 align:middle line:10%
is happening now.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.902 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.902 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:10%
But they promise us a
good new era, a good time.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:90%
But we have a lot of work to do.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And everything
starts with yourself.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.560 align:middle line:90%
You have to start with yourself.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else are going
to make your work.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And you are doing a very good
job sending this further.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But the human being has to
understand they are important.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.100 align:middle line:10%
They are very
important for a lot

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:10%
of multiuniverse in our system.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:37.610 align:middle line:10%
And they have to start to
act with a love energy, who

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:10%
actually are coming to us as
a gift from the universe, now.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's up to you to
make something of it.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.800 align:middle line:10%
You have to start
work with love.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.735 align:middle line:10%
And don't be angry
so long anymore.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Forgiveness.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:10%
Forgiveness.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.755 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yes.

00:29:54.755 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you can be angry,
but not for a long time.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.320 align:middle line:10%
Just accept it and left it.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And open your heart and
ask for what can I do?

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:10%
What can I do today to make
some difference in the world?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:90%
It starts with you.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And you find a way.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And you can see signs.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
They tell me a lot of signs
who are coming-- in the sky,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:90%
in the nature.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you meet
just the right people.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's so obvious now that
they are sending us signs.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:90%
So you are guided.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Trust that.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.702 align:middle line:90%
You are guided.

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And did you have
conversations with them about

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.755 align:middle line:84%
diseases that we have,
that we can have?

00:30:44.755 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
We actually need

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to eat more natural food,
living food, not dead.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Like raw?

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Yeah, and
cultivate our own vegetables

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.940 align:middle line:90%
and fruits, maybe.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Try to do that--
in a small part.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in a balcony
if you really wish.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And ask for it in your shops.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I wish natural, good food.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I'm a vegetarian.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not telling
that's the right thing,

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:10%
because some people need meat,
but not every day-- twice

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:10%
a week, and try to
eat more fish maybe

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:10%
and not so much
meat, because it's

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:36.430 align:middle line:10%
a heavy thing for your body--
more vegetables and fruits

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.935 align:middle line:10%
and juices.

00:31:38.935 --> 00:31:39.810 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Juices, yes.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
Yes, juices is good.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:10%
It's important to eat
very good for the nature.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:51.429 align:middle line:10%
You know that everyone
is aware of it today.

00:31:51.429 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: Well, thank you.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for
this conversation here.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:10%
I see that we're
surrounded by water,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:10%
so my last question is
really about the water.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Is there any type of
messages that you have,

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.300 align:middle line:10%
because there's so many
lakes and water here

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:10%
in this region of the world.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.100 align:middle line:10%
I wonder if it's linked,
because both times we met,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.010 align:middle line:10%
it was around harbors and water.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:10%
So is there anything
related to water

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:10%
that you would like to share?

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON: Water is
also a very important thing.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:10%
It's a gift from heaven to us.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's putting
us all together,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:10%
because the water is everywhere.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you have a sad
day, if you are tired,

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.750 align:middle line:10%
if you want to cry
and scream out,

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.340 align:middle line:10%
just put your hands
in a bowl of water

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.295 align:middle line:10%
and beg the water to take
away all your hard times.

00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:10%
It's helping.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.310 align:middle line:10%
And if you want to
help other peoples,

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:10%
you can go to the
water outside or having

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.630 align:middle line:10%
a lovely bowl in
your home with water.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:10%
Put your hands down
and ask the water

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.690 align:middle line:10%
to send your love, your
loving thoughts to the people

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.360 align:middle line:10%
who needs it.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:10%
It's actually are working.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.380 align:middle line:10%
It's a lovely way to
work with the water.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.420 align:middle line:10%
You are so much water.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:10%
The planet is so much water.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:10%
Use it, because it
wants you to use it.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:10%
And when you drink
water, send it

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:10%
first some love
with your thoughts.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.485 align:middle line:10%
>>LILOU: And foods, too?

00:33:18.485 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:10%
>>FRANK MANSSON:
Yes, with everything.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And drink it with
love, because it's

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:10%
a powerful force inside
you and outside you.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And use it, because
it want to be used.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Love is everywhere,
my beautiful cocreators.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We send you much, much
love from south of Sweden

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:84%
here at the border of
Denmark, because we
