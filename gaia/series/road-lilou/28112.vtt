00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Hello, this is
Lilou for Gaiam TV.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I am today in Paris,
in beautiful France,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:90%
with delicious Sonia Choquette.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Sonia.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.725 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I am so happy to
be here with you.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:90%
You're a world traveler.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Here we were meeting
last week in London,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and now we're here in beautiful
Paris on the Palais Royale.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite
places on Earth,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:10%
with one of my favorite people.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:10%
So Sonia, I love
interviewing Sonia.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Sonia, as you
probably know, has a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:10%
beautiful, bubbly personality.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Loving, really clear.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:90%
And you give the how-to's.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's quite
an important video here.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You're a New York
Times bestseller,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
you're [INAUDIBLE] author,
you travel the world,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual teacher,
a psychic, a medium,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:84%
with just a lot of
capacities that I feel

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
we can all develop these days.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what you
teach to people, isn't it?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Well what I teach is
when you open your heart

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:10%
and you use your second brain,
which is your heart, which

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:10%
really is your first brain,
and you begin to use all

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:10%
of your capacity
as a human being,

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:10%
you begin to develop
a whole constellation

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:10%
of skills that, simply working
from the ego, are not possible.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And those skills are the
things you mentioned.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You develop intuition,
you begin to understand

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
and are able to
create and manifest,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
your personal
energy and vibration

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
improve, so you become
healthier, brighter,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and your world becomes
exponentially better

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
if you begin to live from this
heart-centered consciousness

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are all truly
designed to live.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So all those things
I do are just

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of
this consciousness

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
of higher heart-based living.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I teach.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love it, because
I think this is really essential

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the brain.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean the intellect
is great, but let's now

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
live from a higher level, a much
more intuitive, vibrant level.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Well it's a level--
when we live strictly

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.190 align:middle line:84%
from our intellect and our
ego and our external senses,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
we're living a
very limited life.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Because most of what
we know or believe,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
more importantly, from the
intellect was imposed upon us,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and not really--
it did not really

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
arise from our own
authentic experience.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then to compound that
problem with your senses,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
our senses don't work very well.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't really listen.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't really see
beyond appearances,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
or even see what's in front
of our faces very clearly.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't even taste our
own food very often,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and we don't feel the
energy, or the subtle realms,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
between the physical.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we're kind of
neither here nor there.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
renders us powerless.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin
to live in a more

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
present, heart-based,
conscious experience,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
we begin to connect
with and create

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
a far richer more present, more
grounded, more creative life.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we came in.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.680 align:middle line:84%
We all came in fully
capable of doing this.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And our culture
and our impressions

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and our imprints and
our life experiences

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
dumbed us down, really.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:90%
They robbed us of who we are.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I teach people really
just how to be who they are.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And who they are
naturally, and who they

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:90%
are as their divine imprint.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Their expanded imprint
of humanity is with us

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
all, and we need
to go back to that.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:90%
But we really robbed ourselves.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's time for us to
reclaim it and stop blaming

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
outside, because the real work
there is-- that's what I feel

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is being awake, being
awakened is that.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Well I think that it's
fair to say what we learned

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and believed and trusted
was a consciousness

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:90%
that was powerless.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning
to recognize that,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
one, there's no
one there to save

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:90%
us if we want to be powerless.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
There's no grandfather figure
or parental rescuer who's going

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to come and take care of us.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to
say, you know, it's

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:90%
time to do something different.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's time to realize that victim
thinking, blaming thinking,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
all that kind of
thinking just leaves

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
us very much like a
sheep, like-- I call

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.850 align:middle line:90%
it lambchop to the slaughter.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're just not
going to have any reward.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be no benefit
to continuing that way.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So we-- fortunately
we are beginning

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:90%
to collectively realize that.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.211 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to feel
the fire of our personal power

00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here to flame that
fire, and teach people

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
how to grow that flame, and use
that flame to make their lives

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:90%
brilliant in every way.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get into
the details and the how-to's.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
I would love to hear first, why
do you think we're on Earth?

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here today?

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I think Earth is school.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:10%
I think our soul, as
opposed to our spirit,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:10%
our soul is this part of our
nature that is here to learn,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:10%
to be creative and
unlimited divine beings.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:10%
To be able to live in a way
that is genius and vibrant

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:10%
and loving.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But we have to go
through our lessons

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and begin to separate sort
of the wheat from the chaff.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're here especially--
I believe right now

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that, if Earth is school,
this period on Earth

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
right now is summer
school, where everybody has

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to go back and learn
very quickly how

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to live at a higher,
more creative vibration.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
More loving, more creative,
more responsible, more dynamic.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So we are getting
really stopped.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's like we can't go any
further thinking the old way.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's in
summer school, and we

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:84%
have to learn our lessons,
and how to be higher, more

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
dynamic creative beings now.
-Now.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And it feels easier and easier.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:10%
Well you know, if
you're willing to learn,

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:10%
if you're willing to say
well, whatever I'm doing

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:10%
isn't working, so time to
do something different,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:10%
and let go of control and let go
of fear and let go of the story

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:10%
and just get excited about
trying something different,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:10%
then you're gonna
have a very positive

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:10%
experience very quickly.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
the whole universe

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:90%
is conspiring for our success.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And the general
frequency of the planet

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:90%
is accelerating so quickly.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
We're learning to
be quantum beings.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
We're learning to live
outside of the limitations

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:90%
of our old beliefs.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And if we just try even
something as simple as what

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I call my favorite
yoga pose, which

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
is to pull the ends of
your lips up to your ears

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and hold that pose for
a little while in a day,

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that, for a lot of
people, is very new.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do that, you
open the curtains of the heart.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And you open immediately
to a new frequency.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Even something that
simple would change

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.455 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
your day, will change

00:08:54.455 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:90%
the experience of your day.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.498 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
walk around like that.

00:08:57.498 --> 00:08:58.198 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:58.198 --> 00:08:59.014 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Especially here in Paris.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not a common look.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you do that,
it's infectious.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like your spirit
jumps to another spirit,

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and for a minute they might look
at you like what are you doing,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:90%
but they'll smile back.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
in a different frequency.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So something that
simple will change

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
your experience
immediately, because you're

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:90%
out of your head.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I love those immediate
things that you have.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Like last time you
were teaching us

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
how to just-- when we're in
fear, how to look at an object.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how-- what is
that little technique

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that is of course so obvious,
but we don't even see it.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I think we do it
automatically sometimes,

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
but to do it consciously,
it's like, wow.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
What do you when you're
in fear is, first of all,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
recognize, when you're in fear,
you're not in present time.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You're either
projecting the future

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:90%
or you're reacting to the past.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So your eyes are not registered
right in front of you.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of--
there's a glaze.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the way to remove
yourself from fear is,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
first, begin to start
naming what you fear.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it only possesses
you when you try to

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:90%
stuff it or run from it.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you name it
and you express it,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
it begins to dissipate.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So I'm afraid I'll be late.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I see the table,
I see this beautiful mural,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I see the trees, and I'm
afraid that I won't be loved.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And I see the chairs
and I see the lamps

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and I see the people walking by.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm afraid it's too late
for me to create my life the way

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And I see a bicycle, and
I see some motorcycles,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and a beautiful-- the Louvre.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
that, what happens

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
is that fear that possesses
you begins to relax,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to come
back to present time.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Just like that, really fast.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It's like the fear is gone.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.970 align:middle line:84%
After-- I have never
known it to take

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:90%
more than three minutes.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.240 align:middle line:84%
It takes no more than three
minutes, and the fear is gone,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and you don't feel it anymore.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you're in a place
to create something new.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we only create
in the present moment.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to bring us
back right now here.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.840 align:middle line:84%
We can't create
in our intellect,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:90%
except anxiety and frustration.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And we can't create
unless we're present.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.770 align:middle line:84%
If you are present
and you're not

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
checked out with fear
and anxiety in control,

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
you create very quickly.
Very quickly.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you a story.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:90%
This is such a great story.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching in Australia.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And I taught this very tool.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to demonstrate
it by asking a gentleman

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
in the audience-- I think I had
3,000 people in this audience--

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and I took a gentleman
and he was very upset.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm here because
my wife brought me.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't-- I didn't want to
come, but she convinced me.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm afraid that all of
this is just a waste of time.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I've been unemployed, I
cannot find work I love,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
everybody I work
with is so negative,

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and the country is seized
in so much negativity,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be in a business
where I could lead with

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
creativity and love, and
I want to manage people

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
who are really conscious.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
that's going to happen.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
That's my fear.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
do you see right now?

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Look right in front of you.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I see a
bunch of smiling people.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, and what
else do you see?

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I see you,
and I see the microphone

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and the beautiful lights.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look around
and what else do you see?

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I see-- I see that
right now life is pretty good.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then a man-- I
said, how do you feel?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm not afraid.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And then a man jumped
up in the audience

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and he said, I have a
construction company

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
across Australia, and
I'm trying to build

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
because we just had the floods.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I would like to offer
you a job right now.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And the whole audience
just erupted in joy,

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:90%
So quick.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:90%
So quick.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.436 align:middle line:90%
It was-- I loved it.

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:90%
It was really great.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of
thing that we can expect

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:90%
if we just make that shift.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I'm
afraid, but I'm not going

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:90%
to let it make my choices.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when we
hear that, part of us

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:84%
just love hearing that,
and then we're saying,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
oh, but it's not for me.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It's another person.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:90%
That won't happen to me.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.910 align:middle line:84%
That's an example that is just--
that's one of those examples.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Not me.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start
including ourselves in these.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I would
say is you don't know.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if
that's for you.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Try it before-- and that's
what the mind will do.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
intellect will do.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
It will immediately
make you the exception.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It'll say, you know,
all of humanity

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
can maybe have a
positive experience,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:90%
but you are the exception.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:90%
That is negative narcissism.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
That is I am so
disconnected, but we're

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
learning from quantum physics
no one is disconnected

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:90%
from the sea of consciousness.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you would just let
yourself play in that sea.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite tools
is to say I don't know.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you-- whatever you know,
you know as of a minute ago,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes ago, a year ago.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know for
now and the next moment.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's start living in
the realm of I don't know.

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
And here's another tool.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I love this tool for
people to begin to open

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:90%
that window of creativity.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:90%
The tool is called I wonder.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I started learning
this with [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.165 align:middle line:90%
I just love that tool.

00:15:20.165 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
This tool-- do you know that
Leonardo da Vinci required

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.410 align:middle line:84%
his apprentices to
wonder verbally,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
openly, about 100 things a day?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's how that
collective creativity began

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to become a groundswell for
all their great unlimited

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:90%
inventions.

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can start with, I
wonder who I'll meet today

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:90%
that will make my life great.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if today's the
day I'll fall in love.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this is the moment
where I can actually begin

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to be creative in
the book, the play,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
the dream, the home, the
trip, the return of my health.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what you really mean.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how I can make
the situation better.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:17.272 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what good surprises
are coming to me today.

00:16:17.272 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the
field of potential.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you say I wonder

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is you begin to live
in present time.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And you open to being inspired
and informed in a new way,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way that uses your heart
and your whole brain instead

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
of your habitual way, which
is very defensive and negative

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and blocks everything
and says no.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I wonder says yes to life.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.469 align:middle line:84%
-Like a kid.
-Like a kid.

00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Kids live in wonder.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, until
we go to school,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
we are really pretty much in
a state of grace and bliss.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And wonder activates
your intuition.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Wonder activates that part
of you that can be informed

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
in a quantum way,
in a way that's

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:84%
better and more present
than what we've been told

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:90%
is possible.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if I can fly.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I can create
some kind of a contraption

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
where I can dial
in on a computer

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and have access to
all the information

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
in the world via something
called the internet.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I wonder who wondered
about that first.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what we're
going to create next.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Very different than trying.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Or figuring it out.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Figure it out is
not going to work.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The minute you try to
figure something out,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
you're on the wrong road.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- you're only going
to draw from your frustrations

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
in your past.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.481 align:middle line:84%
So instead of trying to figure
it out, wonder 100 solutions.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Because really on
the multi-level,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:84%
multi-dimensional, a lot
of things are happening

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:90%
at the same time, aren't they?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Well the other thing
that's so exciting

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
is, when we go into
this vibration,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.310 align:middle line:84%
we begin to enter the
divine sea of convergence.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So all the intentions
that begin to meet where

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
we leave the
intellect and we begin

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to open to this new
dimension, it's very magnetic.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to
pull in elements

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
that we could never know
because we haven't met them yet.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.996 align:middle line:84%
They all come
together and voila.

00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
This is part of manifesting
with ease that you teach.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Well let me tell you
a really fun story.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.120 align:middle line:90%
I was teaching many years ago.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I was on a book tour
for my book that is

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:90%
now called The Intuitive Spark.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It was originally
called The Wise Child.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't known very well,
and I went on this book tour

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and I ended up in San Francisco.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And in the bookstore,
there was one person.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
stinky homeless man.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was raining outside.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was traveling
with my friend

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Mark, who does music, which I
need-- I love in my creation.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we got there,
he looked around

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.451 align:middle line:84%
and he said, well,
there's nobody here.

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's go.
And I said, oh, but he's here.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Sonia, he's
not here to hear us.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said, we don't know.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not my business.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:90%
My business is to do what I do.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to sing--
I'm going to talk to him,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to sing to him.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And it was tough.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:90%
My ego was so wounded.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my
god, I'm a failure.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to hear
about this book,

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
about how to raise
intuitive children.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But I started talking to
him, and he sat like this.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was very stinky, and
he was one foot from me.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But I talked to him like
I was talking to the most

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:90%
interested person on Earth.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And then Mark sang to him.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And he was like this.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, he looked
up at me and he winked at me.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And I went-- Mark.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It's an angel.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Keep singing.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we left, and afterwards
my ego kicked back and said,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, this is so hard
and nobody wants to hear this

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm such a failure and
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Well here's what happened.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:84%
The woman who was the
manager of the bookstore

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
moved to another bookstore
in Mountain View.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And one day, a man
came in and he said,

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I am the new acquisitions
director for Hay House.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Who would you recommend
as a good author?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, to tell you
the truth, the one I was most

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
impressed with was Sonia when
she came because, instead

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
of complaining to me that
there was no one here,

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:84%
she poured her heart and soul
into the man in front of her.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And in one minute, I was
acquired by Hay House,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and they told me we're going
to take you around the world,

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and have.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And I now have-- I have now
over 12 books with them.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
In that decision, I
wondered why am I here

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.410 align:middle line:90%
with this stinky homeless man.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.410 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:90%
So you never know.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Don't ever judge by
what's appearances.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't know the magic
trying to help you.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Just do what you do, but do
it-- don't worry about what

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:90%
everybody else is going to do.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Don't hold back, or in
order to, or with all those--

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Figure it out.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Just do what we're doing.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing,
and I wonder if it'll

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:90%
be Oprah or something better.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if there's
even something bigger.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Right here right now.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Right here right now.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
It could be that this is
happening in the moment.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I love living in this
universe of I wonder.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:84%
This is where I live, and this
is where we all are designed

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.730 align:middle line:90%
to live and where we were born.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So there is no-- it's not
anymore a question of I

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
have the money or how
is this going to happen,

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
because really this
universe is abundant.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what also you teach.
It's unlimited.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's why
wonder is so important.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if your
life isn't working,

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
it's not a lack of money,
it's not a lack of love,

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
it's a lack of
imagination and wonder

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:84%
to see all the possibilities
right in front of you.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you another
story really quickly.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I had a client who said--
she was a hairdresser.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm so angry, I live
in the basement,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
my clients don't appreciate
me, I don't have love,

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't see how anything
you're saying applies to me.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I wonder
if you started living

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit more
open energy, and just

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:90%
be willing to be surprised.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:90%
That's another tool I have.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Surprise me with something good.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And so she said, great.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.795 align:middle line:90%
I'll live with surprise.

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I said well, really
give it a try.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Don't sabotage yourself.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:90%
So she said OK, I will.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And every day she said
surprise me, surprise me.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And in a week, her apartment
building burnt down.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that
was the most horrible thing.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's what happened.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Her clients loved her so much
they came with furniture,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.670 align:middle line:84%
they came with food,
they came with offers.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of her clients said,
please move in with me.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a male client.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And he had loved her all
along, and wanted to be

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship with her.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:90%
But she never saw it.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And she moved into his loft.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And the best part
of this story is

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
she had all this old furniture
she hated, but she was insured.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So she got a check for all this
furniture, and she got money,

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and she had love,
and she had friends.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
And they were there all along.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.940 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't see it.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And bam, in a
week, her life went

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
through a complete
loss of everything

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:90%
that she didn't like.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And what came in
in the second wave

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
was everything that
filled her heart.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:90%
She's still with the guy.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
This is years ago.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
That relationship--
so you never know.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And live in this
world of I don't know.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I wonder.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
The universe will
surprise me today.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You're talking often of
the fire in our heart,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and because then we attract
just everything, really, to us.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So part of the surprise
me part, of the wondering,

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.490 align:middle line:90%
is all raising our frequency.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And we can-- there's
also the fire inside

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:90%
that we can learn to fire up.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Lilou, I love that you say
that because it is fire.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is fire.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's alive.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a spark.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:90%
It initiates things.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's no fire
in the intellect.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what you see in
the eyes, it's fire.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what you feel
when you're creating.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a spark, initiative.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge kind of
explosion of creativity.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And that fire is what attracts.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It's the light that
people are drawn to.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like the fire will draw in.

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I say, be the fire
of the spirit,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:90%
not a landfill of old ideas.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Old thoughts and
negativity, it's

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:84%
just a landfill of gross
energy that will repel.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And here's what's
most important.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
There's two words that
will change your life.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And those two
words are I decide.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
You decide what energy
you're going to live.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether you want to admit it
or not, you have a choice.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to choose to go
back to the fire, the spark,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the human
spirit, and live there.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't live
there, where you live,

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
nobody wants to be in the
landfill of old, outworn,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and not very attractive energy.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:90%
So there's some exercises.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
You teach a lot about dancing,
moving, shaking it up.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Well first of all, if the
spirit is fire, fire dances.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Fire moves.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Fire is flexible.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons I
think it's so important for us

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
to move-- that's
a great technique.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:90%
That's another tool right there.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
If you're trying
to figure it out,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
if you're stuck in
negativity, get up,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
go outside, and start walking.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk, notice
what is happening now.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you're afraid and sad--
I was yesterday, I was very sad.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I had a very sad
wave come through.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And my intellect was
confused, and I'm

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:84%
living my beautiful
life, and why am I sad?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was just old stuff.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So as I walked, I
would say, I'm very sad

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
about certain
relationships in my life

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
not being where I want
them to be right now.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But I see fresh baguettes
and beautiful pastries

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
in the window and macaroons
and the flowers of spring.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very sad that
I'm not more-- I don't

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:33.930 align:middle line:90%
have more time to just play.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And what do I see?

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, I see bicycles.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.720 align:middle line:90%
And then I got on one.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll play right now.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And the wave, that wave
of sadness, lifted.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
that's just old stuff.

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
in 24/7 rah-rah-rah

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
because human nature
goes up and down,

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and so just be OK with it.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:90%
But move.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Don't sit in it.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Move with it.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Breathe with it.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And do you know sometimes your
sadness is not even your own?

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
You pick up on the
world's sadness.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Especially people like you, I
feel, that are extra sensitive,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and all of us
being more and more

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to those energies, we
need to learn to distinguish.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And even more importantly,
don't even care.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's just what it is.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.740 align:middle line:90%
But move with it.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm feeling this fear,
I'm feeling this sadness,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling this disappointment.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:90%
We've all had those experiences.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's not fight them or judge
ourself as spiritual failures

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're having
these experiences

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and feeling these feelings.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Just feel them.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But it helps to name what
you're feeling as you move.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't sit in it.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Say what you're
feeling, and move.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Walk.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Bike.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Roller blade.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Swim.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings--
because emotion

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
is just energy in motion.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you try to
stop that energy,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
it really pulls you
into a dark space.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Just move with it.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And spirit wants to
be bigger and brighter.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we go through
those phases, all of us.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good to hear
from people like you

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that are teaching this and that
wrote many books, 12 books.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And to have those
moments, because sometimes

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
the teachers pretend
like, oh, it's all good,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and this is how to do it.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But I feel this is not the
space into which the one

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.720 align:middle line:84%
we are now, because we
all go through motions.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And it feels much closer.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
When you say this,
Sonia, it feels so great.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Because of course you are a
human being, but you know,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
it makes it really even
more so approachable.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So I really appreciate
your authenticity here.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Well I really to
say, as human beings,

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
no one is tripping the
lights fantastic 24/7.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Believe me.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know many
spiritual leaders.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
We are human beings,
and we just need

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to accept that as human beings,
and especially sensitive ones,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.980 align:middle line:84%
there will be times-- it could
be that you're just tired.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It could be that you've
overgiven that day.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be that your
heart is really open

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling the
sensitivity and the pain

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.010 align:middle line:90%
of the people around you.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't care what it is.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Just say, it is what it
is, and move with it.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite thing is
dance your misery out.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Just dance it out.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.929 align:middle line:84%
Shake it.
Shake it.

00:30:33.929 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Shake it out.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.970 align:middle line:90%
And sing it out.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Shake and be-- that's a
favorite tool of mine.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:90%
If-- sing Broadway tunes.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Sing Do-Re-Mi, which
actually is a song

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:90%
that balances your chakras.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Each syllable, each
do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.810 align:middle line:84%
resonates with one
of your chakras.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Sing and dance that out.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes
two or three minutes.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
This isn't-- I'm
not asking anybody

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:90%
to invest time they don't have.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:90%
But it will rob you of time.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And we do not have the
unlimited time to waste.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.950 align:middle line:90%
So try this.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:90%
You might say oh, that's not me.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But the me that's
miserable and stuck

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily
your authentic me.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That is a learned,
defended, disappointed,

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
reactive me that is
just a kind of a veil

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:90%
over your bright spirit.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, years ago, when I
first started teaching publicly,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:90%
I went and saw Jean Houston.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And she's this fabulous
anthropologist.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And she told a story
about a tribe in Africa

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:90%
that never had any war.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And she went to see
what about that tribe

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.965 align:middle line:84%
they were doing that
was so incredible.

00:31:56.965 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:90%
They had no conflict.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said when she got there,
she learned from the tribe

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that when anybody in
the tribe had a problem,

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
they all went to the
center of the village

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and danced till
they got over it.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I-- for that moment
on, I said, that's my tool.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we have a problem,
especially in my family,

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and we're a passionate family
with a lot of strong ideas,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
we can most definitely
collide and argue and fight,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:90%
our egos can do that.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But if we put on the
music and sing and dance,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:90%
we're fine in five minutes.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of solutions.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to this Frenchman
yesterday in south of Toulouse,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and he was
explaining-- actually,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Philippe Weber, that
is a teacher, too--

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and he was just saying
there is some great news

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:90%
in every single area.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Education, there's
this new thing

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
now happening where
there's ambassadors

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of peace inside of classes.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the kids bringing
the peace within the classroom.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.010 align:middle line:84%
There's so many good,
spontaneous initiatives

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that can take place that
can change the world.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us-- the election day
happened yesterday in France.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there
is-- it's not-- it's OK.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:90%
It's what it is.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:90%
We are the ones.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Well I think our
new question needs

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to be don't necessarily be
angry with the way it is,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:90%
because that's the way it is.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you feel anger,
there's something

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.900 align:middle line:90%
in you that wants to say stop.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:90%
So just let it stop for you.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to stop it.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Just stop participating in it,
and you do something different.

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:90%
You do something different.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.530 align:middle line:84%
If you feel that
the world you're in

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:49.565 align:middle line:84%
isn't OK-- I had a great
teacher years ago, and he said,

00:33:49.565 --> 00:33:54.410 align:middle line:84%
if you don't like
the way the world is,

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:84%
then don't be part
of the misery of it.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Be something different,
be something bright.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
You be the solution
in the moment.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't participate in the misery.

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.659 align:middle line:90%
Don't associate yourself to it.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
have lived in a way

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and I have taught
in a way that has

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:84%
really ignited this same
sensibility in others.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:84%
If the vibration that you
are in isn't working for you,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:84%
use your left and
right foot and leave.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Just walk in a different way.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Walk away from the
problem, and walk

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
toward your personal solution.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Do that.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.210 align:middle line:90%
You have a choice.

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.639 align:middle line:84%
Use your creativity
well, and ask

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
yourself, well, given
the circumstances,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.139 align:middle line:90%
what do I decide?

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because that's something
no one can take from you,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.219 align:middle line:90%
is the power to choose.

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:84%
You can choose what
you think and feel

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.075 align:middle line:84%
and focus on and
pay attention to.

00:34:58.075 --> 00:34:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't make it big and global.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:90%
That's oppressive.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Just say, in this
moment, what are

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
we going to choose--
what am I going

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.470 align:middle line:90%
to choose that's different?

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And I choose to
love myself anyway.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'll choose-- maybe
instead of to fight,

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll choose to sing.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And maybe instead of
choosing to be depressed,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll choose to move.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead of choosing
to feel powerless,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to
create something new,

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.030 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a cake or a
salad or I'll rearrange

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:90%
my apartment or my home.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to do
something that pleases

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.500 align:middle line:90%
me, because I love myself.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to listen
to my favorite song.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to go
work in the garden.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to buy
myself some flowers.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll choose to watch
a comedy on TV.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.470 align:middle line:90%
You can always choose something.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.741 align:middle line:84%
Choose something
that's good for you.

00:35:52.741 --> 00:35:53.440 align:middle line:90%
And now.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Not tomorrow, not next
week, not tonight.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Not worrying about
choosing it for the world,

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.530 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes it can
be very daunting, too.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite lessons
I learned when I was young,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I had a beautiful
teacher, Charlie

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Goodman-- and I write
about him in my book

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
The Diary of a Psychic.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.990 align:middle line:84%
He was an incredible,
incredible man.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
as our process of my

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
being a student of
his, I asked him,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.340 align:middle line:84%
well, what do I do
when we're not--

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.900 align:middle line:90%
when I'm not your student?

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And he Sonia, I'll
give you one lesson

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.520 align:middle line:90%
that will make your life work.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that lesson is
mind your own business.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to mind
everybody else's.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Mind yours, and
really do mind it.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to what
is your business,

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.080 align:middle line:84%
what is your life, what
is your creativity, what

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.800 align:middle line:90%
is your vibration.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Mind that.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else will
take care of themselves.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've lived that
way pretty much.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:84%
If my life isn't
working very well,

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the first question
I ask myself, am

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I minding my business
or am I trying

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:90%
to control someone else's.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I'm trying
to control someone else's.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's not going to work.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
very good tool.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, who's
business am I minding.

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And if it's someone else's,
then I'm not minding my own.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not minding my
own, I'm not being creative.

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
really a way to stop

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
things and get back on the
track of living your spirit.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.990 align:middle line:84%
This is what this whole
conversation was about.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sonia.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.800 align:middle line:90%
