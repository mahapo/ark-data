We need to tame the surface, to heal the discord and maintain permanent contact with the stillness underneath. Taylor explains how this stillness, and connection to oneness, can be integrated into every aspect of your daily life.","teaser":"Braving the cold, Lilou sits with Steve Taylor, lecturer and author of seven books.
