>> Lilou: Hello, my
delicious co-creators,

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.981 align:middle line:84%
Lilou here on the
beautiful island of Kauai

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:15.483 align:middle line:90%
in Hawaii, for Gaiam TV.

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.118 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to do
this new interview,

00:00:17.118 --> 00:00:18.686 align:middle line:90%
this time with Nick Good.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.087 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Nick.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Hey, Lilou, thank
you very much for inviting me.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I'm here -- we're here
on NoniLand, this beautiful lot.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.429 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
heard of this place,

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.531 align:middle line:84%
because now you export
a lot of goodies.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes, yes.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:32.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Huh?

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.001 align:middle line:90%
How did you land here?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well, I
originally started off

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:38.139 align:middle line:84%
as David Wolfe's
personal trainer.

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:40.407 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
heard of David Wolfe.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:43.444 align:middle line:84%
He's a luminary in the
royal food movement,

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:45.713 align:middle line:84%
and the living foods,
and super foods.

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:51.719 align:middle line:84%
And he hired me as his personal
trainer about 7 years ago.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.556 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't so much
physical training he was after,

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:59.026 align:middle line:84%
he was after manifesting
certain things in his life.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.862 align:middle line:84%
He had a very difficult
situation

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.864 align:middle line:84%
that he was dealing
with, and he wanted

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
to make some forward
progress in there.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.636 align:middle line:84%
And so he hired me to
help him with that.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:13.307 align:middle line:84%
And we had, let's say, very
swift, very successful,

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.643 align:middle line:84%
pretty miraculous
results in how quickly

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:18.379 align:middle line:84%
that whole thing
shifted for him.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.248 align:middle line:90%
So he was very sold on Nick Good

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.553 align:middle line:84%
and what I was bringing
into his life.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:29.823 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided just to, you
know, experiment a little bit

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:31.926 align:middle line:84%
with out synergy,
just to see how --

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:34.962 align:middle line:84%
what we actually
could create together.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:39.667 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up very
quickly within 12 months

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.804 align:middle line:84%
of knowing each other
living another one of --

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.373 align:middle line:84%
both of our dreams, which was
to have a very successful book

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:51.378 align:middle line:84%
out there, picked up by a
major publishing company.

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:55.081 align:middle line:84%
And so which is -- we have this
book called, "Amazing Grace:

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.651 align:middle line:84%
The Nine Principles of
Living in Natural Magic,"

00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.454 align:middle line:84%
and it was picked up
straightaway by Random House

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and North Atlantic
Books Publishing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.358 align:middle line:90%
and Random House Distributing.

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
So that was wonderful.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.562 align:middle line:84%
And then we thought,
"Well, what else do we want?

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.097 align:middle line:90%
What else do we want," you know.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.866 align:middle line:84%
He'd obviously been traveling
for a long time as well.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:17.972 align:middle line:84%
I'd been traveling for about 21
years, 22 years when I met him,

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:21.508 align:middle line:84%
looking, searching,
seeking for truth,

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:24.211 align:middle line:84%
for empowering information,
that really, really,

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:90%
really can help people.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.684 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided to
sort of pool our research

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.988 align:middle line:84%
and create a center in
the Hawaiian Islands.

00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:36.757 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know where it was,
we didn't have the money

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:40.227 align:middle line:84%
to buy anything, but we decided
to come to Hawaii together,

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:43.931 align:middle line:84%
which we did, and almost
instantaneously as soon

00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.933 align:middle line:84%
as we got to Kauai,
the whole thing opened

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.768 align:middle line:90%
up for NoniLand here,

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:52.907 align:middle line:84%
and 7 years later we have
this amazing facility here,

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:56.877 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of a blend between
an agricultural research center

00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
where we experiment with
growing a wide diversity

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.355 align:middle line:84%
of tropical fruits,
plants, herbs, antigens,

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:14.361 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of different
diverse ecosystems together,

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
introducing things from
all over the planet.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.101 align:middle line:84%
And we blend that with a
personal development facility.

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.937 align:middle line:84%
So people come here to
discover themselves,

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:29.376 align:middle line:84%
to empower themselves, to unfold
their innate human potential,

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.512 align:middle line:84%
which is really my
favorite subject

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:33.948 align:middle line:84%
and what I'd dedicated
my life to.

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:35.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And we're going
to speak about that,

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.852 align:middle line:84%
because I would really love to,
you know, get the big picture

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.187 align:middle line:84%
of why you're doing this
right now and why you feel all

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:43.691 align:middle line:84%
of this is so important,
especially in these times.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And then later on we
can speak about how the food,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.595 align:middle line:84%
the body, all of
that is important

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.464 align:middle line:90%
for our own spiritual awakening.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.965 align:middle line:90%
This is a big component of it.

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.836 align:middle line:84%
We cannot just do the -- the
whole heart thing is beautiful,

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.005 align:middle line:84%
but there is more than that,
huh, through this whole process.

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.641 align:middle line:84%
It does -- how do you
feel about these times?

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.976 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well, I
feel -- I'm sort of --

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:05.612 align:middle line:90%
I'm very real realist.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.349 align:middle line:84%
I've been traveling a long
time, and I come from kind

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.451 align:middle line:84%
of like the other
side of the track.

00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.688 align:middle line:84%
I had a pretty rough childhood,
and used to, you know, hang --

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:19.126 align:middle line:84%
and run around with some
wild boys, and I kind of come

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:22.296 align:middle line:84%
from the bad boy club
coming into, you know,

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:23.731 align:middle line:90%
the good side of things.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:27.234 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen a lot in
life, and I understand

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:90%
and see things very clearly.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.174 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of traveling,
and so the realism --

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm wholly optimistic, but not
so much based on what I see,

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.754 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the way the mass
consciousness is oriented

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:48.555 align:middle line:90%
in the world at the moment.

00:04:48.555 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel that generally speaking
the masses are inviting calamity

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:04.471 align:middle line:84%
upon themselves, and that most
people that are awakening are --

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:10.744 align:middle line:84%
well let's put it this way, the
people that aren't awake yet,

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:14.848 align:middle line:84%
that aren't grounded in really
practical physical, mental,

00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.585 align:middle line:84%
emotional, and spiritual
lifestyle that allows them

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:22.756 align:middle line:84%
to move forward, ascend into a
higher version of themselves,

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.825 align:middle line:84%
into an improved
version of themselves,

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:27.327 align:middle line:84%
that they're facilitating
themselves,

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.229 align:middle line:90%
they're doing it themselves.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.699 align:middle line:84%
The people that aren't
on that path already,

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.303 align:middle line:84%
that are just beginning to
suspect that something's wrong,

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.039 align:middle line:84%
and they might be
thinking, "Okay.

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.074 align:middle line:84%
Well, I need to start
doing something about it,"

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.477 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know what to do,

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:47.014 align:middle line:84%
I feel that there's a
rude awakening coming

00:05:47.014 --> 00:05:48.415 align:middle line:90%
for those people.

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.284 align:middle line:84%
And as we -- you
know, like I'm very --

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:52.853 align:middle line:84%
got my finger on the pulse
with, you know, what's going on,

00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:54.555 align:middle line:90%
on the street in this world.

00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.891 align:middle line:84%
I have telephone conversations,
do consultancy for people all

00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.928 align:middle line:84%
over the world, emails, and
I have a website that deals

00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.831 align:middle line:84%
with people from all different
countries, helping them

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.033 align:middle line:84%
with the challenges
that they're faced with.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:09.269 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
the pattern is clear,

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:12.806 align:middle line:84%
that the masses still
haven't woken up.

00:06:12.806 --> 00:06:15.742 align:middle line:84%
And where -- and how
they are awakening is

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:17.644 align:middle line:90%
through something negative.

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:20.481 align:middle line:84%
It's the negative
manifestation of wonder;

00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.649 align:middle line:90%
because life is wonderful.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:24.084 align:middle line:90%
And the idea is, is to wake

00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:27.187 align:middle line:84%
up through the positive
manifestation of wonder.

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:30.157 align:middle line:84%
So you feel wonderful, you
look better and better,

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:32.159 align:middle line:84%
you become healthier, and
healthier, and healthier,

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.995 align:middle line:84%
your relationships
improve, you become happier,

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle line:84%
just for being alive,
your ability to attract

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:42.136 align:middle line:84%
to yourself the life of your
dreams, all that kind of stuff.

00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:45.439 align:middle line:84%
That's all a positive and
manifestation of wonder.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.276 align:middle line:84%
But there's a negative
manifestation of wonder as well.

00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:53.113 align:middle line:84%
And in this world, people
are awakening to the fact

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:56.049 align:middle line:84%
that they are the victims
of a control system,

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:58.418 align:middle line:84%
that there are agendas,
there are hidden agendas,

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:02.322 align:middle line:84%
there are secret agendas,
there are esoteric agendas,

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:05.292 align:middle line:84%
and that these agendas
have been alluded to,

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.862 align:middle line:84%
not just in the alternative
media and the conspiracy group

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:14.801 align:middle line:84%
of investigators, but
also in great films.

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:18.705 align:middle line:84%
For instance, "The Matrix" was
a very, very, very clear sort

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:22.376 align:middle line:84%
of a pop defining
way of looking at reality.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: How old is
that film now, I don't know,

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:25.979 align:middle line:84%
but it's still extremely
relevant.

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Over 10 years I think.

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:28.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Yes; and
communicates something,

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:31.318 align:middle line:84%
you know, essentially
that we need to,

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.719 align:middle line:90%
you know, wake up and realize.

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But the enormity of the
shift of consciousness

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
between the normal waking
state, someone who's living

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in the matrix, going to work
in the matrix is in debt

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
to the matrix, has
mortgages, has their family,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.168 align:middle line:90%
their children are in the --

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:53.206 align:middle line:84%
being schooled through
the conditioning

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:55.175 align:middle line:84%
that is the education
system in the matrix,

00:07:55.175 --> 00:07:58.545 align:middle line:90%
that eat that kind of food.

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:03.917 align:middle line:84%
For them to awaken
out of that situation,

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:90%
that's a great challenge.

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:08.388 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge leap; a huge leap.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:13.126 align:middle line:84%
And you really want to be
moving along this path slowly

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:16.263 align:middle line:84%
but surely, baby steps every
day, baby steps every day.

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it really boils down
to the way you breathe,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.868 align:middle line:90%
the way you orient your heart,

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:26.707 align:middle line:84%
the way you honestly center
yourself in your physical body,

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and literally how you live
every facet of your life.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And unfortunately
there is a lot of people

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:34.915 align:middle line:84%
that we -- as human beings
we learn through suffering,

00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.383 align:middle line:84%
and there is -- there's
bankruptcy,

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:39.186 align:middle line:84%
there's people losing their
jobs, there's divorces,

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:42.789 align:middle line:84%
diseases, that all of
a sudden makes us see

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.157 align:middle line:90%
that there is something else.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:48.161 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess that's most
of having parents that died

00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.664 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, and you
having yourself face that,

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:53.033 align:middle line:84%
and having to go through all
the difficulties you have,

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.901 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be the
one that you are now.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:56.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Absolutely.

00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So they're
definitely serving us,

00:08:57.137 --> 00:08:59.406 align:middle line:84%
and this gives us a big
huge kick in the butt,

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:04.011 align:middle line:84%
and the option is -- the
solution is not suicide.

00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:04.945 align:middle line:90%
There is something else.

00:09:04.945 --> 00:09:06.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes, that's right.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.814 align:middle line:84%
And that's wonderful you
brought that point up,

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:11.385 align:middle line:84%
how all of these so-called
negative manifestations do

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:12.386 align:middle line:90%
serve us.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:14.288 align:middle line:84%
And evil in itself
is here to serve.

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:21.595 align:middle line:84%
The situation that we're faced
with in the world right now is

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:27.401 align:middle line:84%
so extreme that in
order to deal with it,

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:84%
in order to transcend it,
to actually live in grace,

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:34.675 align:middle line:84%
this book that we wrote called
"Amazing Grace," we believe

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:38.111 align:middle line:84%
in grace, that it's
possible for you to be --

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.847 align:middle line:90%
like it says in Psalm 91,

00:09:40.847 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that terrible things can
happen very close to you,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.853 align:middle line:84%
right next to you, but
it won't affect you.

00:09:46.853 --> 00:09:52.192 align:middle line:84%
Like the only building that
survived the bomb blast

00:09:52.192 --> 00:09:54.728 align:middle line:84%
in Hiroshima -- I don't
know whether you ever heard

00:09:54.728 --> 00:09:58.098 align:middle line:84%
that story, but there was only
one building standing within --

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.866 align:middle line:84%
close to the epicenter
of that blast,

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:03.203 align:middle line:84%
and that was a convent,
a convent with nuns.

00:10:03.203 --> 00:10:06.273 align:middle line:84%
We hear of stories
from the Vietnam War

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:12.079 align:middle line:84%
where a whole platoon of men
were saying Psalm 91 every day

00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.881 align:middle line:84%
when they were on active service
in war and never lost a man.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:19.519 align:middle line:84%
Not one died through that --
through saying that Psalm.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:23.457 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not giving a
religious message here,

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.727 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying is, is that
there is something very real

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:31.398 align:middle line:84%
in life that is extremely
wonderful, and all powerful,

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:34.267 align:middle line:84%
and it lifts you up
and keeps you safe.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:35.602 align:middle line:90%
And I've experienced --

00:10:35.602 --> 00:10:38.305 align:middle line:84%
I experimented and
experienced with that.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:42.275 align:middle line:84%
I push that into extreme
situations myself,

00:10:42.275 --> 00:10:45.712 align:middle line:84%
to test that out, to test that
theory out; because as far

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:84%
as religion, and spirituality,
the word of God, and Jesus

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:52.519 align:middle line:84%
and all that, I couldn't even
mention those words until I was,

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:56.256 align:middle line:84%
you know, about 30 years
old, because the association

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:59.259 align:middle line:84%
that I had with all those
words was a big stick,

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:03.997 align:middle line:84%
and really been brutalized by
some very, very, very dark men.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.098 align:middle line:90%
[Laughs]

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So how do you
describe grace then?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.202 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Well, grace is --

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a natural component
of life.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.346 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural built-in,
magical, invisible component

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:22.115 align:middle line:90%
of life that's extremely real.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:27.921 align:middle line:84%
And all -- and it's kind
of like a filter, you know,

00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:30.457 align:middle line:84%
like you see -- obviously you've
traveled a lot and you've been

00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:90%
to -- you meet a lot of people.

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of individuals in
the world are interested

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.365 align:middle line:84%
in personal empowerment,
becoming powerful, yes;

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.567 align:middle line:84%
and they have various
means of doing that.

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle line:84%
In the business sector, we're
coming off a period of time

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.908 align:middle line:84%
where neuro-linguistic
programming has been very,

00:11:47.908 --> 00:11:49.309 align:middle line:90%
very popular.

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:53.046 align:middle line:84%
You know, books like "How To Win
Friends and Influence People,"

00:11:53.046 --> 00:11:56.416 align:middle line:84%
manipulation, hypnosis,
how to hypnotize people,

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.219 align:middle line:84%
how to be in rapport
with people, how to --

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and train to their field so
they will do what you want them

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.892 align:middle line:90%
to do, powerful visualization

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:08.595 align:middle line:90%
stuff, sex magic to... you know,

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:10.797 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these things to
get more power, more power,

00:12:10.797 --> 00:12:11.932 align:middle line:90%
more power, more power.

00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:13.733 align:middle line:84%
Lots and lots and lots
of people are doing it.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.769 align:middle line:90%
No secret, no mystery to it all.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:20.941 align:middle line:84%
But that only allows you to
experience a certain degree

00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of power and a certain
kind of power.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle line:84%
What we want is to actually
be living in the wonder

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.115 align:middle line:84%
and the magic of life, where
things happen through ease

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:32.552 align:middle line:84%
and grace, where you attract
things to you very, very easily.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:34.554 align:middle line:90%
Everything is almost effortless.

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:38.825 align:middle line:84%
And the synchronicity of it
all is magical and wonderful.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:42.596 align:middle line:84%
So you literally -- I found
in my life when I'm really

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in the flow, I'm just
going from one appointment

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:84%
to the next appointment,
that I don't know

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:50.971 align:middle line:84%
who I'm having an appointment
with, or where it's going to be,

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.572 align:middle line:84%
or what's exactly
going to happen.

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:56.776 align:middle line:84%
But it's like ah, here's another
situation, another circumstance

00:12:56.776 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
where it's getting --
where there's more magic,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.916 align:middle line:84%
more support, and
more movement forward,

00:13:02.916 --> 00:13:06.987 align:middle line:84%
more wonderful things coming
in, more health, more community,

00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:09.656 align:middle line:84%
more love, you know,
all these good things.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:10.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Endless.

00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:12.058 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Yes,
endless; endless.

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.327 align:middle line:90%
So grace is endless.

00:13:14.327 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And what it really boils down
to is the purity of your heart.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.068 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
it all boils down to,

00:13:22.068 --> 00:13:25.939 align:middle line:84%
is how pure is your
heart genuinely?

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:32.312 align:middle line:84%
That means how do
you love yourself?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:38.151 align:middle line:84%
Are you demonstrating enough
love for yourself to eat

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:42.289 align:middle line:84%
in a better way, to think
healthier, happier thoughts,

00:13:42.289 --> 00:13:45.792 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve your negative
emotional conditioning

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.862 align:middle line:84%
and the patterns of
the internal dialogues

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%
that you might have inherited

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.432 align:middle line:84%
or you might have been
planning out for a long time?

00:13:52.432 --> 00:13:57.137 align:middle line:84%
Do you love yourself enough
to really connect with life

00:13:57.137 --> 00:13:59.239 align:middle line:90%
and move much deeper in life

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:03.276 align:middle line:84%
than the matrix actually
keeps us trapped in?

00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:08.281 align:middle line:84%
And do you -- are you -- do
you genuinely love other people

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:10.216 align:middle line:84%
and want to serve
and help others?

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:13.954 align:middle line:84%
Is your life devoted
to helping others?

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:17.991 align:middle line:84%
Are you essentially a healer,
you know, and a teacher,

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.727 align:middle line:84%
and just by your way
of being, you know.

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:22.429 align:middle line:84%
That's basically what
it comes down to,

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:25.899 align:middle line:84%
and that's a very
natural evolution

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.735 align:middle line:84%
of a human being on
a spiritual path.

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:31.438 align:middle line:84%
It's not, "I wanted
to be a healer," or,

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:34.407 align:middle line:84%
"I want to be a teacher, and I'm
going study and doing, doing,

00:14:34.407 --> 00:14:38.845 align:middle line:84%
doing all this to be this,
you know, individual."

00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:41.915 align:middle line:84%
No; it happens because
of qualities of being

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:45.819 align:middle line:84%
that you uncover within
yourself as you remove

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.289 align:middle line:84%
and dissolve the things that
aren't you, the vibrations

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:51.391 align:middle line:84%
that aren't you, all
that kind of stuff,

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle line:84%
the conditioning that's
been so imposed on you.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.798 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very, very,
very beautiful experience

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:00.667 align:middle line:84%
that requires the
opening of the heart

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.802 align:middle line:90%
and the tendering of the heart.

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:04.304 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of this suffering

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:07.374 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
tenderizes our heart.

00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.075 align:middle line:90%
And so the tenderness,

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.579 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of that tenderness
is really what we connect --

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.281 align:middle line:84%
what we're supposed to be
connecting with life with.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:20.553 align:middle line:84%
That's the organ of interface,
the tender sweet heartedness.

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:23.656 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
life picks up on,

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:26.659 align:middle line:84%
and defines the grace
-- the level of grace.

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:29.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So when you mean
"tender," you mean vulnerable,

00:15:29.162 --> 00:15:32.499 align:middle line:84%
you mean soft, you
mean ready to open?

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.133 align:middle line:90%
What --

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.136 align:middle line:84%
It's -- you know, there's --
I haven't got it on today,

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:38.905 align:middle line:84%
but I usually wear this
little thing of Jesus.

00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:42.575 align:middle line:84%
It's an old Catholic
picture of Jesus

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:44.844 align:middle line:84%
where He's holding
His tunic open

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's this
bleeding heart, you know.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.217 align:middle line:84%
And they -- it's -- the
warrior's heart bleeds.

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:56.356 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't being
touched with reality,

00:15:56.356 --> 00:16:00.193 align:middle line:84%
the amount of suffering,
the degradation of nature,

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:84%
the brutality that's
been visited upon women,

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:09.035 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of children,
and child pornography,

00:16:09.035 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
sex slave trade, the born evil
that's active in the world,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you can't actually
being touched with that

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.979 align:middle line:84%
and not feel some
kind of soul pain.

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.749 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is why
the indigenous cultures,

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:26.853 align:middle line:84%
you hang out with the indigenous
people and there's a deep, deep,

00:16:26.853 --> 00:16:29.956 align:middle line:84%
deep sadness, because they're
in touch with their souls,

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:35.995 align:middle line:84%
and the human soul is in angst,
and Mother Earth is, you see.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:40.266 align:middle line:84%
And so a spiritual warrior
is in touch with that,

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.535 align:middle line:90%
but has -- but accommodates it.

00:16:42.535 --> 00:16:43.403 align:middle line:90%
I accommodate it.

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:45.138 align:middle line:90%
I accommodate that pain.

00:16:45.138 --> 00:16:46.773 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: You welcome
that pain; yes.

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:47.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes; we have to.

00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.242 align:middle line:90%
We can't be in denial about it.

00:16:49.242 --> 00:16:51.978 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful quote
from -- and this is --

00:16:51.978 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys are really
interested in education

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.449 align:middle line:90%
at Gaiam TV, and so, you know,

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.152 align:middle line:84%
what is education
really, what is it?

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:01.888 align:middle line:84%
And so I specialize in
what I feel education is,

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:04.491 align:middle line:84%
and it's understanding
how we actually work

00:17:04.491 --> 00:17:06.893 align:middle line:84%
and what life actually
really is.

00:17:06.893 --> 00:17:11.598 align:middle line:84%
The matrix is superimposed
upon something else.

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:12.799 align:middle line:90%
And it's that something else

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.399 align:middle line:84%
that we really want
to be connected with.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So it means living
deeper, living from depth,

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.908 align:middle line:84%
living from depth within
yourself, seeing things

00:17:21.908 --> 00:17:24.844 align:middle line:84%
in a different way,
seeing through the illusion

00:17:24.844 --> 00:17:26.646 align:middle line:90%
and the façade of things, yes.

00:17:26.646 --> 00:17:27.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: If you're intuitive.

00:17:27.447 --> 00:17:28.548 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.517 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
beautiful quote from a book

00:17:30.517 --> 00:17:35.221 align:middle line:84%
by Glenda Green called "Love
Without End: Jesus Speaks."

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:38.758 align:middle line:84%
And anyone that's confused
about the message of Jesus

00:17:38.758 --> 00:17:40.026 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't -- you know,

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:45.098 align:middle line:84%
is repulsed by the
religious viewpoint on it all,

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:48.835 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend "Love
With End: Jesus Speaks."

00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:52.405 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't say anything that
you can't get from the Bible

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.407 align:middle line:84%
if you understand
spiritual truth,

00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:55.742 align:middle line:84%
if you know what
you're looking for.

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.479 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of my
favorite topics is --

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:04.918 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of like
translating what Jesus meant

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:09.122 align:middle line:84%
really and truly, and what the
original church, the original --

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:12.792 align:middle line:84%
when the -- after the --
after Jesus had resurrected

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:15.128 align:middle line:84%
and been 40 days
with the disciples

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:16.729 align:middle line:84%
and they'd all set
fire to their --

00:18:16.729 --> 00:18:20.366 align:middle line:84%
spiritually set fire to the
place, and they were all,

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.702 align:middle line:84%
you know, raising the
dead and healing the sick,

00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of it.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.539 align:middle line:84%
That fire went out
into the world.

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.976 align:middle line:84%
And it's an unstoppable fire,
and it's still blazing today.

00:18:29.976 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But immediately the Roman
Empire, which, you know,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.349 align:middle line:84%
they were the controlling
force, the invading force,

00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:37.784 align:middle line:90%
and they acted very swiftly,

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and they created the
Roman Catholic religion,

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.891 align:middle line:84%
and they created the Holy
Bible at the Council of Nicea

00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:47.927 align:middle line:84%
in the 3rd Century, 300 years
after all this went down.

00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:50.096 align:middle line:90%
So they kept it and tried

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the core
pure message of Jesus.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.501 align:middle line:84%
And so it's been
terribly distorted.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:58.037 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that you notice --

00:18:58.037 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have as you travel
the world, is you go to any

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
of these really dark
old European countries

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.114 align:middle line:84%
and South American countries
where Catholicism is still,

00:19:08.114 --> 00:19:11.384 align:middle line:84%
you know, really entrenched
in the culture, and the memory

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:15.121 align:middle line:84%
of the brutality, and the
ill-treatment of women

00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:17.156 align:middle line:84%
and children and all the
rest of it, the child abuse,

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:20.793 align:middle line:84%
all of that stuff, is in-soaked
into the fabric of the culture

00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:24.864 align:middle line:84%
of the villages, the old women
how sad and heavy they are.

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:29.569 align:middle line:84%
There's a beauty that comes
through that can never, ever,

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:33.773 align:middle line:84%
ever, ever, ever be
destroyed by control systems,

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:37.777 align:middle line:84%
by falsifying scriptures,
by editing things,

00:19:37.777 --> 00:19:40.747 align:middle line:84%
by removing stuff, because
it's a spiritual truth.

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:41.848 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:43.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: It's a
living truth that is all

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:46.252 align:middle line:84%
about the quality of human
being, and we innately know --

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:50.423 align:middle line:84%
our souls know who they are,
which is like seeds planted

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:52.091 align:middle line:90%
in the substance of life.

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:55.128 align:middle line:84%
And we're growing, and
we know who we are.

00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.663 align:middle line:90%
We know what we are.

00:19:56.663 --> 00:19:59.933 align:middle line:84%
And so these -- you know, a lot
of these old ladies have just,

00:19:59.933 --> 00:20:01.701 align:middle line:84%
you know, they're
such an inspiration,

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:05.271 align:middle line:84%
because no matter all of that
heavy, heavy, heavy darkness,

00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.173 align:middle line:84%
the shame, and the
guilt, and the sorrow,

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:08.908 align:middle line:90%
there's a sweet beauty coming

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:11.811 align:middle line:84%
through from this
tenderhearted goodness.

00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:14.814 align:middle line:84%
And this is the thing that will
win through no matter what.

00:20:14.814 --> 00:20:16.182 align:middle line:90%
You can't, can't stop it.

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:17.984 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what they do.

00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:18.985 align:middle line:90%
It's irrelevant.

00:20:18.985 --> 00:20:23.323 align:middle line:84%
So the grace transcends
everything.

00:20:23.323 --> 00:20:26.893 align:middle line:84%
But this quote I
wanted to tell you,

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:30.563 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said that history
repeats itself generation

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:35.368 align:middle line:84%
after generation, because
of judgment and denial.

00:20:35.368 --> 00:20:40.573 align:middle line:84%
Judgment and denial cause
ruptures in the flow of life.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:44.711 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe fills
those ruptures very quickly

00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:48.214 align:middle line:84%
with the very things
our objections deny.

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:50.717 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just make
that even simpler.

00:20:50.717 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying is, is that
there is a flow to life.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:56.189 align:middle line:90%
You have a life flow.

00:20:56.189 --> 00:20:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I have a life flow.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.926 align:middle line:84%
There's a flow to our --
there's a current to life.

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:01.327 align:middle line:90%
It's invisible.

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:05.565 align:middle line:84%
And it can pick you up no
matter what situation you're in,

00:21:05.565 --> 00:21:07.834 align:middle line:84%
you might be penniless,
you might be getting thrown

00:21:07.834 --> 00:21:09.569 align:middle line:84%
out of your house,
you might be --

00:21:09.569 --> 00:21:11.637 align:middle line:84%
your relationship
might be dreadful,

00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.072 align:middle line:90%
you might be an alcoholic,

00:21:13.072 --> 00:21:16.509 align:middle line:84%
you might be a mass
murderer, it doesn't matter.

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:21.814 align:middle line:84%
If you can get in touch with
that through your heart,

00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:25.385 align:middle line:84%
the movement of your heart,
the quality of your heart,

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:28.221 align:middle line:84%
it will pick you up,
and it will carry you

00:21:28.221 --> 00:21:30.723 align:middle line:84%
into wonderful, beautiful
futures.

00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:33.359 align:middle line:84%
And it will do it in a
very, very practical way.

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:36.863 align:middle line:84%
It will synchronistically bring
people that you need to meet.

00:21:36.863 --> 00:21:39.799 align:middle line:84%
It will give you books
that you need to read.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.668 align:middle line:84%
It will play you music
that you need to hear.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:44.237 align:middle line:90%
Things will happen.

00:21:44.237 --> 00:21:45.605 align:middle line:90%
And it will guide you --

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
life will guide you
into circumstances

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.342 align:middle line:90%
which are basically initiator.

00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:50.176 align:middle line:90%
You're initiators.

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:52.044 align:middle line:90%
This is your next opportunity.

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:54.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: But is there like
your process that you found out,

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:57.216 align:middle line:84%
or some things that can
help us along the way,

00:21:57.216 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:84%
or it's really just about
jumping out of this --

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.355 align:middle line:84%
off this cliff and
in the unknown

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:04.123 align:middle line:90%
and letting grace carry us?

00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:05.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well, it's
definitely processes,

00:22:05.725 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and it's definitely techniques,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.496 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely
protocols that can help.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:13.132 align:middle line:84%
But everyone is an
individual, you see?

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:14.801 align:middle line:90%
The soul is like a snowflake.

00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a snowflake
that's fallen that's been the

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.305 align:middle line:90%
same as another one.

00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:21.841 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things to do --

00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:25.578 align:middle line:84%
what I try and do is I
sift through the, you know,

00:22:25.578 --> 00:22:31.350 align:middle line:84%
modalities and the techniques,
and I extract the golden threads

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.754 align:middle line:84%
of truth that are relevant
to lots of different ones.

00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:37.356 align:middle line:84%
That little quote that I
just told you right there,

00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:39.659 align:middle line:84%
stay out of judgment
and stay out of denial.

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:43.463 align:middle line:84%
Number one, if you can pull
that one off, that's incredible.

00:22:43.463 --> 00:22:46.632 align:middle line:84%
That's incredible; because
I'll tell you how it works.

00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:49.268 align:middle line:84%
We're in a -- the
physical body exists

00:22:49.268 --> 00:22:54.006 align:middle line:84%
in a physical material world,
which is an energy construct,

00:22:54.006 --> 00:22:59.679 align:middle line:84%
and in order for time-space
continuum to exist,

00:22:59.679 --> 00:23:02.882 align:middle line:84%
time and space, that's the
substance of time and space,

00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:08.754 align:middle line:84%
the fabric of time and space,
which is curved and spirals,

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:11.257 align:middle line:84%
in order for that to exist,
you have to have polarity.

00:23:11.257 --> 00:23:14.727 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
positive and negative

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:18.865 align:middle line:84%
in the electromagnetic spectrum,
so you have opposites, yes?

00:23:18.865 --> 00:23:22.235 align:middle line:84%
Within that there's a
flow within that current,

00:23:22.235 --> 00:23:25.137 align:middle line:90%
there's a natural life flow.

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:32.178 align:middle line:84%
If you resist polarizing
your opinions, okay,

00:23:32.178 --> 00:23:33.479 align:middle line:90%
this is a big secret here.

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:36.349 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very deep, and
I'm telling you right now.

00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:39.018 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when we see
all of this dreadful stuff

00:23:39.018 --> 00:23:42.221 align:middle line:84%
that the governments are doing,
the governments are supporting,

00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:45.391 align:middle line:84%
we go a little deeper down
the rabbit hole and we awaken

00:23:45.391 --> 00:23:47.894 align:middle line:84%
through this shocking
horror of what's going

00:23:47.894 --> 00:23:52.832 align:middle line:84%
on behind the scenes, and has
been for a very long time.

00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:58.671 align:middle line:84%
If we can resist judging it,
but not be in denial about it --

00:23:58.671 --> 00:23:59.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:23:59.972 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: -- okay, so
we don't deny it, it exists.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Evil is a simple fact
of life in this world.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to judge
it, because when I do,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.919 align:middle line:84%
I polarize myself in this
time-space continuum,

00:24:12.919 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and I stand opposite it,
and I say, "That is wrong.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.725 align:middle line:90%
That is bad.

00:24:19.725 --> 00:24:22.361 align:middle line:90%
I am not into it."

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:25.131 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm standing
here opposing it.

00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:28.768 align:middle line:84%
What that does it is
reinforces polarity, yes.

00:24:28.768 --> 00:24:30.336 align:middle line:90%
So it basically feeds --

00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:31.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: It feeds what
they're looking for.

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:32.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.974 align:middle line:84%
And they want emotional
response,

00:24:34.974 --> 00:24:37.143 align:middle line:90%
especially of low vibration.

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:38.644 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want.

00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:43.416 align:middle line:84%
The trick is this, is there
is a place inside of you

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.686 align:middle line:84%
which is the epicenter of
your being, the epicenter

00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:51.924 align:middle line:84%
of where this electromagnetic
spectrum spirals out from.

00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:54.393 align:middle line:84%
That epicenter you
can call your soul,

00:24:54.393 --> 00:24:56.629 align:middle line:90%
you can call it the zero point,

00:24:56.629 --> 00:24:58.664 align:middle line:84%
you can call it whatever
you want, but it exists.

00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:00.233 align:middle line:90%
It's an epicenter.

00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:04.203 align:middle line:84%
Quantum signs -- signs actually
is actually very fine, it's

00:25:04.203 --> 00:25:09.275 align:middle line:84%
existence, a tiny point
of light in the center

00:25:09.275 --> 00:25:13.346 align:middle line:84%
of your physical body,
a tiny point of light.

00:25:13.346 --> 00:25:14.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: A spark.

00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:15.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Yes,
a spark of light.

00:25:15.715 --> 00:25:19.085 align:middle line:84%
So we call that the soul, yes,
just for -- that's the soul.

00:25:19.085 --> 00:25:21.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And so that
was the home of the soul.

00:25:21.787 --> 00:25:24.023 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well, the
-- what you call what?

00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:25.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: The heart
was the heart

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.125 align:middle line:90%
of -- the home of the soul.

00:25:26.125 --> 00:25:26.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well,
that's what I'm saying,

00:25:26.993 --> 00:25:28.694 align:middle line:90%
that's the epicenter there, yes.

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:29.695 align:middle line:90%
Now, the yogis would say

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.697 align:middle line:84%
that the sea of consciousness
is here.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:84%
The Taoist practitioners
would say it's here in the lower

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.004 align:middle line:90%
down here, yes?

00:25:38.004 --> 00:25:41.807 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about is
a metaphysical phenomena.

00:25:41.807 --> 00:25:44.276 align:middle line:84%
So it transcends the
space-time continuum.

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:47.747 align:middle line:90%
So it's not anywhere in there.

00:25:47.747 --> 00:25:51.117 align:middle line:84%
So it can be all of these
3 places simultaneously.

00:25:51.117 --> 00:25:52.151 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:25:52.785 --> 00:25:53.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the mindset
that we need to nurture.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:84%
We need to be able to open
our minds and expand our minds

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:07.667 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate everything that
is good and bad in the world,

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:10.703 align:middle line:84%
and connect with a
truth, a living truth,

00:26:10.703 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
the power that transcends
it all.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:19.078 align:middle line:84%
And then you, the physical
person, which isn't who you are,

00:26:19.078 --> 00:26:21.113 align:middle line:84%
if you are that epicenter
of consciousness,

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:24.583 align:middle line:84%
if you are the spiritual being,
this is just a projection

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.553 align:middle line:84%
into this amazing movie
screen called life.

00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:30.256 align:middle line:84%
When you do that,
this little puppet

00:26:30.256 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:84%
in the muppet show
becomes a very more --

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.899 align:middle line:84%
much more empowered, and is
able to find the flow in life,

00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:45.171 align:middle line:84%
and isn't chopping it with
his judgment, and his denial.

00:26:45.171 --> 00:26:48.841 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe
pours itself like concrete

00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:52.445 align:middle line:84%
into those things, because
we have emotional response

00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:55.247 align:middle line:84%
to stuff, we get very
self-opinionated and we say,

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:56.415 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,

00:26:56.415 --> 00:26:58.517 align:middle line:90%
and we're beating the drum.

00:26:58.517 --> 00:27:00.486 align:middle line:84%
This is what Abraham
and Abraham-Hicks,

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:03.055 align:middle line:84%
anyone who wants educating
about vibrational --

00:27:03.055 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
your vibrations,

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.792 align:middle line:84%
check into the Abraham-Hicks
stuff.

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We bang the drum, whatever
our dominant thoughts are,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.733 align:middle line:84%
our dominant emotions, dominant
feelings, we're banging, bang,

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:15.568 align:middle line:84%
bang, bang, bang,
bang this drum.

00:27:15.568 --> 00:27:17.903 align:middle line:84%
Life listens to that
drum all the time.

00:27:17.903 --> 00:27:20.673 align:middle line:84%
And we magnetize to
ourselves more often

00:27:20.673 --> 00:27:25.244 align:middle line:84%
than not the things we don't
want, not the things that we do.

00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:28.814 align:middle line:84%
This is why most people's lives
are going down the spiral,

00:27:28.814 --> 00:27:33.953 align:middle line:84%
because they are faced with,
you know, debt, with toxicity,

00:27:33.953 --> 00:27:38.124 align:middle line:84%
with their being poisoned, their
being brainwashed, and they are.

00:27:38.124 --> 00:27:42.528 align:middle line:84%
They're being driven into, you
know, some form of slavery.

00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:45.364 align:middle line:84%
And so that's scary, and it
doesn't make you feel good.

00:27:45.364 --> 00:27:47.399 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to happen
if you're banging the drum,

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:49.735 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm frightened
then I don't feel good.

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:52.171 align:middle line:84%
Life is going to give
you a frightening reality

00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't make you feel good.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.308 align:middle line:84%
So this is fundamental
stuff here.

00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:57.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It is.

00:27:57.643 --> 00:27:59.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: So we need to
really look at this and go,

00:27:59.078 --> 00:28:02.615 align:middle line:84%
"Okay, I need to feel good if
I want to live a good life.

00:28:02.615 --> 00:28:05.885 align:middle line:84%
I need to feel amazing if
I want an amazing life.

00:28:05.885 --> 00:28:11.023 align:middle line:84%
And I need to feel like I
am above it all if I want

00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:14.293 align:middle line:84%
to live a life that
transcends the matrix," you see.

00:28:14.293 --> 00:28:17.863 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where the
daily lifestyle comes in,

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:84%
our daily rituals, the daily
protocols, the attention

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.703 align:middle line:84%
to detail in our lives
physically, mentally,

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.939 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:27.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:28:27.907 --> 00:28:29.675 align:middle line:84%
On a nutritional
level, for example,

00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
what do you think
we're deficient

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.147 align:middle line:84%
of that is preventing
us from raising above?

00:28:35.147 --> 00:28:36.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Well,
we're deficient of --

00:28:36.982 --> 00:28:44.123 align:middle line:84%
the main deficiency is
a spiritual, mental,

00:28:44.123 --> 00:28:46.692 align:middle line:90%
and emotional anorexia.

00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:50.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: It's all entangled.

00:28:50.129 --> 00:28:54.834 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: We're starving
of spiritual presence,

00:28:54.834 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
genuine spiritual nourishment,
which comes in the form

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.706 align:middle line:90%
of pure peace and blessed,

00:29:00.706 --> 00:29:04.076 align:middle line:84%
which means that our brain is
functioning in something called

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:08.881 align:middle line:84%
"the alpha, beta, delta
wave frequencies."

00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:13.619 align:middle line:84%
That means it slows down instead
of the beta very, very quick,

00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:15.754 align:middle line:84%
stressing out, this
massive to do list to do,

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.389 align:middle line:84%
going from one thing
to the other.

00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:84%
I've got to drop the kids off,
I've got to go to the bank,

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:21.794 align:middle line:84%
caught in the traffic and
all this stuff keeps you

00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:23.963 align:middle line:90%
in that, yes.

00:29:23.963 --> 00:29:28.901 align:middle line:84%
We are starving for deep
relaxation, for bliss,

00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:30.536 align:middle line:84%
for higher states
of consciousness.

00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:33.172 align:middle line:84%
These are very, very real
thing I'm talking about now.

00:29:33.172 --> 00:29:36.609 align:middle line:90%
Psychologically we're starving

00:29:36.609 --> 00:29:39.445 align:middle line:84%
from the same states
of consciousness.

00:29:39.445 --> 00:29:43.015 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally we're starving
from the nourishment that comes

00:29:43.015 --> 00:29:48.721 align:middle line:84%
from simply existing in harmony
and connection with the depth

00:29:48.721 --> 00:29:52.157 align:middle line:84%
of life, instead of
what's just on the surface.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:53.893 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
really starving.

00:29:53.893 --> 00:29:55.661 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:58.998 align:middle line:84%
We go and stuff and
shovel, and try

00:29:58.998 --> 00:30:02.668 align:middle line:90%
and feel fulfillment from food.

00:30:02.668 --> 00:30:08.474 align:middle line:84%
Most of our drives for food are
coming from emotional addiction,

00:30:08.474 --> 00:30:11.977 align:middle line:84%
emotional instability,
emotional problems,

00:30:11.977 --> 00:30:14.546 align:middle line:90%
psychological problems, habits,

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.417 align:middle line:84%
and patterns that
do not serve us.

00:30:18.417 --> 00:30:19.718 align:middle line:90%
And we're trapped in it.

00:30:19.718 --> 00:30:21.287 align:middle line:84%
You know, most people
are trapped in it.

00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:25.024 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we have
to get the context right.

00:30:25.024 --> 00:30:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm more -- I'm a -- the soul of
the epicenter of consciousness

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.829 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
here is like a camera lens.

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.599 align:middle line:84%
It's like this camera that
I'm looking at right now.

00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:37.169 align:middle line:84%
And I am in control
of that lens.

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:41.807 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in control of my
mind, if I have the ability

00:30:41.807 --> 00:30:47.279 align:middle line:84%
to breathe consciously,
if I have a solid practice

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:50.482 align:middle line:84%
where I practice
self-mastery every day,

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:54.119 align:middle line:84%
which is just basically
breathing and thinking

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:56.121 align:middle line:84%
in the different way
that isn't associated

00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:59.625 align:middle line:84%
with the beta state
and the matrix stuff.

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:04.063 align:middle line:84%
So that means meditation,
chi gong, communion

00:31:04.063 --> 00:31:08.734 align:middle line:84%
with nature, gardening, these
are all practices

00:31:08.734 --> 00:31:13.572 align:middle line:84%
that it just allows me to sink
in with my deeper sense of self.

00:31:13.572 --> 00:31:17.142 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have that, then
I'm just overwhelmed by life,

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:19.979 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just in the ego flood.

00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:24.416 align:middle line:84%
I'm just being carried along
down the river of fate,

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.719 align:middle line:84%
circumstances going
from the next problem

00:31:26.719 --> 00:31:30.456 align:middle line:84%
to the next challenge, dealing
with stuff that is coming

00:31:30.456 --> 00:31:31.724 align:middle line:90%
to get me, kind of thing,

00:31:31.724 --> 00:31:36.762 align:middle line:84%
rather than me actually
consciously creating my reality

00:31:36.762 --> 00:31:39.465 align:middle line:84%
just through resonance, just
through my state of being.

00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:42.434 align:middle line:84%
You understand how that
works, vibrational magnetism,

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
my vibrational state based
on my spiritual attunement,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:56.915 align:middle line:84%
my psychological health, and my
emotional sanity, and purity.

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.387 align:middle line:84%
When those things are
discordant and toxic,

00:32:01.387 --> 00:32:05.524 align:middle line:84%
I attract to myself a
discordant and toxic reality.

00:32:05.524 --> 00:32:06.892 align:middle line:90%
It can't be any other way.

00:32:06.892 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:90%
And that is going to wake me up.

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.998 align:middle line:84%
And that's what humanity is
getting, is the big slaps

00:32:12.998 --> 00:32:17.803 align:middle line:84%
from what it's created, is
looking at what it's created,

00:32:17.803 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
the machine, this -- what it
supports, this government,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.511 align:middle line:84%
industrial, pharmaceutical,
military machine

00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:30.516 align:middle line:84%
that is literally raping and
pillaging all over the planet

00:32:30.516 --> 00:32:34.686 align:middle line:84%
with no regard for the
sanctity of nature,

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:37.656 align:middle line:90%
or human beings' lives.

00:32:37.656 --> 00:32:39.691 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
dreadful, dreadful thing.

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:44.663 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm supporting that and
I'm in it, and I'm just trying

00:32:44.663 --> 00:32:50.369 align:middle line:84%
to do the best I can in it, and
make the best of what we've got,

00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to do anything.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.072 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to do anything,

00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're just
going with that thing.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.776 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do it step
out of that, have the courage

00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to step out of that, and
this is the hero's journey.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.881 align:middle line:90%
This is the journey of the hero.

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:04.716 align:middle line:90%
This is the hero's journey.

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:08.153 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual journey,
it's an internal journey,

00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:12.057 align:middle line:84%
and so it's a very, very, very,
very, very simple journey,

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:17.396 align:middle line:84%
because it boils down to
moving from here into here.

00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.465 align:middle line:90%
It's a very short journey.

00:33:19.465 --> 00:33:22.768 align:middle line:84%
You know, how long is
that, about 18 inches?

00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
But it can take you
your whole life,

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.974 align:middle line:84%
and it can involve
tremendous changes.

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:32.878 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
is, is that individuals,

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:36.915 align:middle line:84%
millions of us, are
waking up little by little.

00:33:36.915 --> 00:33:38.784 align:middle line:84%
But what we need
to understand is

00:33:38.784 --> 00:33:40.853 align:middle line:90%
that we have to go all the way.

00:33:40.853 --> 00:33:44.423 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to have
-- do a bit of meditation,

00:33:44.423 --> 00:33:47.526 align:middle line:84%
to do a bit of yoga, to
eat a bit of raw food,

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:52.364 align:middle line:84%
or some super foods, and still
be in the machine and running

00:33:52.364 --> 00:33:54.399 align:middle line:84%
around on the -- you
know, in the rat race.

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:56.034 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.703 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do
is step out of

00:33:57.703 --> 00:34:02.407 align:middle line:84%
that into the next grandest
version of ourselves.

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is where the stage is.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.479 align:middle line:84%
You have to go to your
own stage, your own pace,

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:10.516 align:middle line:90%
your own rhythm, your own cycle

00:34:10.516 --> 00:34:13.185 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's absolutely
unique for you as an individual,

00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:15.787 align:middle line:90%
which only you can decide.

00:34:15.787 --> 00:34:20.559 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from your guidance,
following your impulses,

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:24.229 align:middle line:84%
making your mistakes,
tracking back, "Oh, okay,

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:26.731 align:middle line:84%
I should have turned left there
instead of turning right."

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:29.034 align:middle line:84%
"I should have said
this, instead of that."

00:34:29.034 --> 00:34:30.802 align:middle line:84%
"I should have done
this, instead of that."

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:34.238 align:middle line:84%
"Okay. I know, 'Ouch
that hurt, thank you,

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I've got the message."

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.742 align:middle line:90%
You know, and off we go.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:39.545 align:middle line:84%
And then you reinforce
the choices that you make,

00:34:39.545 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:90%
that you decide, "Okay.

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:43.414 align:middle line:84%
This is the direction that I
want to go in, in my life."

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:45.217 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
practice visualizing that.

00:34:45.217 --> 00:34:48.954 align:middle line:84%
We have to have hold
of our imaginations.

00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said that
imagination was more important

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.492 align:middle line:90%
than knowledge.

00:34:53.492 --> 00:34:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That's Einstein; more
important than knowledge.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You think about that, and
how important in knowledge?

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to Einstein
imagination is more important.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.468 align:middle line:90%
And this is very, very,

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:06.838 align:middle line:84%
very important what I'm telling
you right now, to have control

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:10.776 align:middle line:84%
of your own imagination,
to possess your mind,

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:12.878 align:middle line:84%
to really be master
of your own mind.

00:35:12.878 --> 00:35:17.115 align:middle line:84%
So you think what you want to
think when you want to think it.

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:19.418 align:middle line:84%
You imagine what
you want to imagine,

00:35:19.418 --> 00:35:21.186 align:middle line:90%
when you want to imagine it.

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:23.388 align:middle line:84%
And you don't do
it unconsciously,

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:90%
you do it consciously.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It is -- with the heart
is like the engine.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.997 align:middle line:84%
Okay; the purity of your heart,
the purity of your heart,

00:35:31.997 --> 00:35:35.300 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your
heart, is like the engine

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.969 align:middle line:90%
that drives everything.

00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:42.307 align:middle line:84%
But your imagination
sets the direction

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:44.009 align:middle line:90%
that that engine is going into.

00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:47.079 align:middle line:84%
Another way of putting it,
your heart is like the genie

00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:49.181 align:middle line:90%
that makes things happen.

00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:54.887 align:middle line:84%
But the imagination is what
you tell the genie to manifest.

00:35:54.887 --> 00:35:55.687 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:56.321 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:35:56.321 --> 00:35:57.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:35:57.422 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And so most people's
minds are so conditioned

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.496 align:middle line:84%
with the vibrations
of the machine.

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:05.731 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:08.667 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is why
negativity and evil is a wonder.

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It is most wondrous, it's
absolutely mind-blowing.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.907 align:middle line:84%
I find it heartily fascinating,
really and truly,

00:36:15.907 --> 00:36:18.277 align:middle line:90%
because it's so clever, based

00:36:18.277 --> 00:36:21.079 align:middle line:84%
on an absolutely crystal
clear understanding

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:23.015 align:middle line:90%
of how the human being works.

00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:25.617 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
is they are trying

00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:29.688 align:middle line:84%
to own the vibrational
realm, okay?

00:36:29.688 --> 00:36:34.259 align:middle line:84%
So that means they have
to possess your mind.

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:37.396 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, they want to
keep you in a vibrational state,

00:36:37.396 --> 00:36:41.566 align:middle line:84%
they want your brain
literally vibrating at a speed

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:45.771 align:middle line:84%
that shuts you out of your
deeper sense of sense.

00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:48.273 align:middle line:84%
You see; like that
seed is planted in life

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:51.376 align:middle line:90%
and knows it's a beautiful tree.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:54.246 align:middle line:84%
They want to keep you in
the surface of vibrations,

00:36:54.246 --> 00:36:55.647 align:middle line:90%
the surface recordings,

00:36:55.647 --> 00:36:57.749 align:middle line:84%
the things that you've
been conditioned

00:36:57.749 --> 00:37:01.453 align:middle line:84%
with from this lifetime, from
education, so-called education

00:37:01.453 --> 00:37:04.489 align:middle line:84%
from the media, from
entertainment,

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.693 align:middle line:84%
the entertainment industry,
with all of its violence.

00:37:07.693 --> 00:37:10.762 align:middle line:84%
It's not a coincidence that
there's so much violence

00:37:10.762 --> 00:37:13.865 align:middle line:84%
that passes for entertainment,
and has been doing for ever

00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:20.238 align:middle line:84%
since television was invented;
and of course big-screen movies.

00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:25.077 align:middle line:84%
Music; they changed
the chromatic scale,

00:37:25.077 --> 00:37:28.947 align:middle line:84%
they changed the frequencies of
how we tune our instruments away

00:37:28.947 --> 00:37:32.317 align:middle line:84%
from solfeggio to
chromatic, which is out of tune

00:37:32.317 --> 00:37:35.754 align:middle line:84%
with our natural --
the natural attunement

00:37:35.754 --> 00:37:37.723 align:middle line:84%
of our energy centers
in our bodies.

00:37:37.723 --> 00:37:40.058 align:middle line:90%
So vibrationally we're being hit

00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:43.695 align:middle line:84%
with our favorite music is very
often slightly discordant to us,

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:45.297 align:middle line:84%
so it keeps us just a
little bit out of tune.

00:37:45.297 --> 00:37:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course the music that
we don't like, you know,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.839 align:middle line:84%
the heavy rock, the really --
you know, the thrash and the --

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:56.475 align:middle line:84%
you know, the really
heavy, heavy, heavy stuff,

00:37:56.475 --> 00:37:59.378 align:middle line:84%
it's still using the same
frequencies, the same tuning,

00:37:59.378 --> 00:38:01.813 align:middle line:84%
but it's driving in a
completely different way.

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's very obvious to some
people when music is discordant,

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's still guitars,
musical instruments still tuned

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.921 align:middle line:90%
to the same thing.

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:13.492 align:middle line:84%
Time; they've done it with time
chronologically, they shifted

00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:18.263 align:middle line:84%
from the moon cycles into PNR
calendars attuned

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:22.267 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, and as planting and
living in tune with moon cycles

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and nature's rhythms, into
the Gregorian calendar.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.838 align:middle line:90%
Pope Gregory; this is all --

00:38:26.838 --> 00:38:29.107 align:middle line:84%
you know, these are
actions of the Roman --

00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:31.243 align:middle line:90%
what was the Roman Empire,

00:38:31.243 --> 00:38:33.278 align:middle line:84%
working through the
Roman Catholic --

00:38:33.278 --> 00:38:36.114 align:middle line:84%
with the Roman Catholic
Church, which is --

00:38:36.114 --> 00:38:41.653 align:middle line:84%
nowadays is still the same
controlling entity behind the

00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:44.689 align:middle line:84%
scenes, but it's got
different fronts, much --

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.691 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many, many
more different fronts.

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.862 align:middle line:84%
So the chronology has
been shifted as well.

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:53.698 align:middle line:84%
So we're out of sync
with the time

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:57.269 align:middle line:84%
of the natural rhythms
and cycles of life.

00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:59.237 align:middle line:84%
And of course they
compound it with the food.

00:38:59.237 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals in the food are
very, very, very important

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.843 align:middle line:84%
for creating discordance
and toxicity within us.

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.445 align:middle line:84%
And the water, the
poisons in the water,

00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:11.116 align:middle line:84%
the poisons in the air, and
just that they have the EMF's,

00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:15.487 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic frequencies,
you see, so vibrational attack

00:39:15.487 --> 00:39:18.757 align:middle line:84%
on a physical, mental,
emotional, and spiritual being

00:39:18.757 --> 00:39:21.393 align:middle line:90%
for the purposes of control.

00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:23.728 align:middle line:90%
And so it's good to know this.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really good to
know this, but it doesn't mean

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be wallowing in
it, in judgment, or not looking

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.139 align:middle line:84%
at it in denial, you
know, which is --

00:39:34.139 --> 00:39:35.373 align:middle line:90%
judgment is a big mistake

00:39:35.373 --> 00:39:39.444 align:middle line:84%
that all the conspiracy
researchers make, you know,

00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:41.847 align:middle line:84%
all of them, every
single one of them.

00:39:41.847 --> 00:39:45.617 align:middle line:84%
There isn't one of them who's
really standing in power

00:39:45.617 --> 00:39:47.886 align:middle line:84%
and really empowering
people in the way

00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:50.121 align:middle line:84%
that people can be
empowered, and the power

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:52.524 align:middle line:84%
that they can stand in;
none of them at all.

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:56.661 align:middle line:84%
They are pointing the finger
over there, screaming loudly,

00:39:56.661 --> 00:40:00.265 align:middle line:84%
looking at the mess that evil
is, and picking up all the shit

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:01.933 align:middle line:84%
of evil and going,
"Look at this shit.

00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:03.001 align:middle line:90%
Look at this shit.

00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:03.869 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it dreadful?

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:04.803 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it stink?

00:40:04.803 --> 00:40:05.770 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it horrible?

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.672 align:middle line:84%
Look what it's doing
to your life."

00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:08.974 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we know.

00:40:08.974 --> 00:40:10.842 align:middle line:90%
We know. It's not news.

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
not news anymore.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.812 align:middle line:90%
We understand this.

00:40:13.812 --> 00:40:16.214 align:middle line:84%
This has been, you know, fact
of life for a very long time.

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:20.418 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do is transcend
it and come into real power

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:23.121 align:middle line:90%
where we can accommodate it.

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:24.956 align:middle line:90%
We can accommodate it.

00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:31.196 align:middle line:84%
We can find room for
it in our graciousness,

00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:34.466 align:middle line:84%
still maintain our
poise, and live a life

00:40:34.466 --> 00:40:36.568 align:middle line:90%
that shuts out completely.

00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:37.769 align:middle line:90%
So we actually are on --

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.038 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally on a
completely different frequency.

00:40:40.038 --> 00:40:41.406 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:40:41.406 --> 00:40:43.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: Yes; because we need
that, we need to realize it,

00:40:43.175 --> 00:40:44.876 align:middle line:84%
we need to realize
the situation,

00:40:44.876 --> 00:40:47.445 align:middle line:84%
because then we can transmute
that energy and use it --

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:48.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:40:48.213 --> 00:40:49.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: -- for the good.

00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:50.749 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Absolutely;
and that's [overlapping].

00:40:50.749 --> 00:40:52.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: I really do feel
it's part of the process.

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:54.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Yes; that's
what we've got to do.

00:40:54.286 --> 00:40:55.487 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:40:55.487 --> 00:41:00.759 align:middle line:84%
And there's seeds of this
phenomena in the world.

00:41:00.759 --> 00:41:04.195 align:middle line:84%
Our -- and they're
there for a very, very,

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.897 align:middle line:90%
very, very good reason.

00:41:05.897 --> 00:41:09.367 align:middle line:84%
And we -- it's humble
-- it's humility to --

00:41:09.367 --> 00:41:11.703 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, it's humility,
humble.

00:41:11.703 --> 00:41:13.705 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
reason exactly.

00:41:13.705 --> 00:41:17.409 align:middle line:84%
We know it's a motivational
force.

00:41:17.409 --> 00:41:22.714 align:middle line:84%
We know it's a catalyst to make
us change, because we need to,

00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:24.282 align:middle line:84%
you know, shift out
of the comfort zone.

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:28.653 align:middle line:84%
We really need to wake up, and
very, very, very, very quickly,

00:41:28.653 --> 00:41:30.355 align:middle line:90%
because it's not a joke.

00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:34.693 align:middle line:84%
There's no guarantees
in this world at all

00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:38.063 align:middle line:84%
about your salvation, the
salvation of your soul,

00:41:38.063 --> 00:41:43.168 align:middle line:84%
the safety of your
family, your children,

00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:44.436 align:middle line:90%
the future of humanity.

00:41:44.436 --> 00:41:46.404 align:middle line:84%
There's no guarantees
whatsoever.

00:41:46.404 --> 00:41:50.575 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous amount of
disinformation being perpetrated

00:41:50.575 --> 00:41:54.446 align:middle line:84%
on purpose through -- especially
through the New Age Movement,

00:41:54.446 --> 00:41:56.181 align:middle line:84%
when we hear of all
kinds of, you know,

00:41:56.181 --> 00:41:58.883 align:middle line:90%
saviors coming to save us.

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.485 align:middle line:90%
Organized religion is --

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:03.888 align:middle line:84%
you know, when we really do the
research, these things are not

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:08.226 align:middle line:84%
in tune with the original
teachers and founders

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:11.763 align:middle line:84%
of the movements that these
religions came out of.

00:42:11.763 --> 00:42:13.932 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
have been engineered.

00:42:13.932 --> 00:42:17.836 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like,
okay, well maybe it is

00:42:17.836 --> 00:42:20.305 align:middle line:90%
down to us as individuals.

00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:21.673 align:middle line:90%
You know, maybe it is.

00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:26.444 align:middle line:84%
So what I feel honestly is I
have tremendous faith and love

00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:30.148 align:middle line:84%
for God, love for the
Almighty presence.

00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:33.418 align:middle line:84%
But it needs to be translated
into the nitty-gritty

00:42:33.418 --> 00:42:38.523 align:middle line:84%
and practicalities of life how
I improve myself, physically,

00:42:38.523 --> 00:42:40.191 align:middle line:84%
mentally, emotionally,
and spiritually,

00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:43.361 align:middle line:84%
and how I can help others and
support others in doing it

00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:47.298 align:middle line:84%
as well, so that we all become
empowered, and we actually start

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:50.702 align:middle line:84%
to live in tune with the
real messages of Jesus,

00:42:50.702 --> 00:42:53.438 align:middle line:84%
and of Buddha, and of all
the great spiritual teachers,

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:57.042 align:middle line:84%
which say, "You can do
greater things than me.

00:42:57.042 --> 00:42:58.977 align:middle line:90%
You can do this as well.

00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:03.581 align:middle line:84%
What I've done is to inspire
you, not to get you graveling

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:05.717 align:middle line:84%
around on the floor
and, you know, thinking,

00:43:05.717 --> 00:43:07.986 align:middle line:84%
"I'm going to come and
sort your stuff out."

00:43:07.986 --> 00:43:09.921 align:middle line:90%
That's not what life's for.

00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:13.491 align:middle line:84%
Life is for us to -- it gives
us an opportunity to awaken,

00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:19.464 align:middle line:84%
and we are in something right
now, this world, this matrix,

00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:23.468 align:middle line:84%
that is 3-dimensional, and
when we think something,

00:43:23.468 --> 00:43:26.638 align:middle line:84%
when we say something,
when we feel something,

00:43:26.638 --> 00:43:28.373 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation,
the consequences

00:43:28.373 --> 00:43:34.179 align:middle line:84%
of that happens slowly,
relatively slowly for some

00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:38.283 align:middle line:84%
of us, pretty quickly
for others, yes?

00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:41.219 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting faster,
and faster, and faster.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be able to
master our imaginations,

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:50.795 align:middle line:84%
and the emotion, the emotive
energy that's coming through it.

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we live from
depth, we become less driven

00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.839 align:middle line:84%
by our reactive emotions, and
more empowered by our feelings,

00:44:00.839 --> 00:44:04.075 align:middle line:84%
by our sweet feelings, our
pure feelings, the feelings

00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:08.213 align:middle line:84%
of goodness, the virtues
that naturally exist

00:44:08.213 --> 00:44:10.348 align:middle line:90%
in the heart and in the soul.

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:14.853 align:middle line:84%
This virtual path, this great
journey, the heroes' journey,

00:44:14.853 --> 00:44:19.257 align:middle line:84%
the warriors' journey, spiritual
warriors' journey, isn't a path

00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:23.862 align:middle line:84%
of adding to myself,
improving myself by adding,

00:44:23.862 --> 00:44:28.433 align:middle line:84%
it's a path of letting go, of
shedding, of realizing things,

00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:31.035 align:middle line:90%
of growing up, of awakening,

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of just all seeing
more clearly, you see?

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.276 align:middle line:84%
And that's a beautiful
thing, because part

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:42.981 align:middle line:84%
of the disinformation that is
promoted and has been a lot

00:44:42.981 --> 00:44:45.283 align:middle line:90%
in the self-help movement,

00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:47.485 align:middle line:84%
the self-improvement
personal development,

00:44:47.485 --> 00:44:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and certainly New Age -- a lot
of New Age teachers, you know,

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:56.261 align:middle line:84%
you can have huge volumes
of things, of, you know,

00:44:56.261 --> 00:44:59.497 align:middle line:84%
we've got to learn all this, all
these different things, very,

00:44:59.497 --> 00:45:04.302 align:middle line:84%
very complicated mantras,
complicated spiritual practices,

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:07.305 align:middle line:84%
austerities, you know,
things that really, really,

00:45:07.305 --> 00:45:10.441 align:middle line:84%
really take a long time, can
be painful, years, and years,

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and years, and years, and
years, and years of practice.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.678 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:17.515 align:middle line:90%
None of that is necessary.

00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:23.822 align:middle line:84%
All that's really required is
to shift -- slow the brain down,

00:45:23.822 --> 00:45:26.991 align:middle line:84%
which is cooling the thoughts,
which meditation helps you do,

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:28.560 align:middle line:90%
there's no doubt about it,

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.397 align:middle line:84%
but mostly to be focused
on your own breath.

00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:36.167 align:middle line:84%
This is basically what I
can boil down everything,

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:39.204 align:middle line:84%
that if these were my last
dying words, and I had something

00:45:39.204 --> 00:45:44.375 align:middle line:84%
of a word to say, I'd say,
"Breathe the love of life.

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:47.378 align:middle line:84%
Breathe the love of
life with every breath."

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:48.746 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: And release?

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:52.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: And
radiate blessings out.

00:45:52.383 --> 00:45:55.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: So you don't even
release the toxic thoughts.

00:45:55.553 --> 00:45:58.556 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: Negativity;
there's no need to,

00:45:58.556 --> 00:46:00.992 align:middle line:90%
because they only exist

00:46:00.992 --> 00:46:04.262 align:middle line:84%
in the most superficial
levels of your being.

00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.331 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, you
want to get real.

00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.633 align:middle line:84%
That means dropping down
into who you truly are,

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:11.636 align:middle line:90%
which transcends all of it.

00:46:11.636 --> 00:46:15.607 align:middle line:84%
The home mountain -- like
we could sit here all day.

00:46:15.607 --> 00:46:19.711 align:middle line:84%
I could have the top conspiracy
theorist in the world,

00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:21.112 align:middle line:90%
David Icke, Jordan Maxwell,

00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:22.313 align:middle line:90%
Michael Sarian,

00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:25.016 align:middle line:84%
any of those guys
sitting here with me,

00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:27.318 align:middle line:84%
and I could let them
talk all day,

00:46:27.318 --> 00:46:31.456 align:middle line:84%
and list everything that's
bad, everything that's wrong,

00:46:31.456 --> 00:46:34.425 align:middle line:84%
how dreadful it all is,
how controlled we are,

00:46:34.425 --> 00:46:38.863 align:middle line:84%
how they've got us absolutely,
and just going on, and on,

00:46:38.863 --> 00:46:39.998 align:middle line:90%
and on, and on, and on, all day.

00:46:39.998 --> 00:46:44.302 align:middle line:84%
And I could say, "Can
we just take a breath?"

00:46:44.302 --> 00:46:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.772 align:middle line:84%
David Icke himself will change
a lot I feel, though.

00:46:47.772 --> 00:46:48.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:46:48.973 --> 00:46:50.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: He's more and
more into the love topic,

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.943 align:middle line:84%
and when he speaks about
that, boy, is he powerful.

00:46:51.943 --> 00:46:52.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:46:52.644 --> 00:46:53.845 align:middle line:90%
He has changed a lot,

00:46:53.845 --> 00:46:55.813 align:middle line:84%
and he always had --
but he always had it.

00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:56.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:57.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: You know,

00:46:57.715 --> 00:46:58.549 align:middle line:84%
the truth vibration's
right from the beginning.

00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:59.684 align:middle line:90%
I know David Icke personally.

00:46:59.684 --> 00:47:02.654 align:middle line:84%
I've been to his house,
I've hung out with him,

00:47:02.654 --> 00:47:05.823 align:middle line:84%
but his diet is absolutely
dreadful.

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:08.660 align:middle line:84%
He's a very unhealthy
physical guy.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.765 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of toxicity
and acidity in his system.

00:47:13.765 --> 00:47:15.833 align:middle line:84%
He's crippled with
arthritis in his hands.

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:16.501 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:47:16.501 --> 00:47:17.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Hmm.

00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: He
has dreadful pain.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:24.609 align:middle line:84%
That man suffers needlessly
through an extremely toxic diet.

00:47:24.609 --> 00:47:29.113 align:middle line:84%
His second wife called
us several times here,

00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:33.651 align:middle line:84%
and when we try to, you know, I
offered to accommodate him here

00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:84%
to put him through a cleanse,
to get him on the program,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.622 align:middle line:90%
to help him, you know,

00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:40.525 align:middle line:84%
really come into like
physical embodiment

00:47:40.525 --> 00:47:43.728 align:middle line:84%
of what he's preaching; because
it's very important we offer the

00:47:43.728 --> 00:47:46.297 align:middle line:84%
physical embodiments,
not just mentally,

00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:49.834 align:middle line:84%
not just philosophically,
no we need to be cellular.

00:47:49.834 --> 00:47:51.269 align:middle line:90%
And we can do that.

00:47:51.269 --> 00:47:52.603 align:middle line:90%
We can totally do that.

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:55.974 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I agree, he's
definitely -- he's on it.

00:47:55.974 --> 00:47:58.943 align:middle line:84%
I check his stuff out
a lot on the far --

00:47:58.943 --> 00:48:03.448 align:middle line:84%
I subscribe, I've been a
supporter of his for years.

00:48:03.448 --> 00:48:07.986 align:middle line:84%
But every time I do an interview
with him, I don't even use it,

00:48:07.986 --> 00:48:13.257 align:middle line:84%
because it's just too much
negative charge in it.

00:48:13.257 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:84%
What we need to be able
to do is look at all this

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.895 align:middle line:90%
and have a neutral charge.

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:22.367 align:middle line:84%
It's neutrality that allows
us to access 0 point energy,

00:48:22.367 --> 00:48:26.404 align:middle line:84%
which is where the power comes
from to offset it completely,

00:48:26.404 --> 00:48:29.073 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't matter how
long this has been going on.

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:33.244 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about the reptilian
agenda, and many people do.

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:36.881 align:middle line:84%
You know, many, many people do,
not just David Icke, many very,

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:38.716 align:middle line:84%
very, very switched
on researchers.

00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:44.655 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can, you know, see
all these quotes in the Bible,

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:48.292 align:middle line:84%
in some of the scriptures
that the Bible was based

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:51.029 align:middle line:90%
on from the Sumerian text.

00:48:51.029 --> 00:48:55.299 align:middle line:84%
There's tremendous evidence,
architectural evidence,

00:48:55.299 --> 00:49:00.204 align:middle line:84%
artistic evidence, scriptural
evidence, the Narkomanie texts.

00:49:00.204 --> 00:49:01.906 align:middle line:90%
There's tons of it.

00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:04.075 align:middle line:90%
And I've researched it all.

00:49:04.075 --> 00:49:09.347 align:middle line:84%
There's no shortage of proof
that this phenomena exists.

00:49:09.347 --> 00:49:15.853 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, 260,000
years, 13,000 years,

00:49:15.853 --> 00:49:17.989 align:middle line:84%
quarter of a million
years, whatever you want,

00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:21.459 align:middle line:84%
it's nothing compared to
eternity, absolutely nothing.

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And nothing compared
to what we going to radiate out.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Exactly.

00:49:25.496 --> 00:49:28.633 align:middle line:84%
So but if we are in touch
with that eternal --

00:49:28.633 --> 00:49:32.036 align:middle line:90%
into our own internal nature,

00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:36.007 align:middle line:84%
through that heart-centered
scared-hearted awareness,

00:49:36.007 --> 00:49:39.343 align:middle line:84%
where we're actually really
connecting it with the faith,

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:42.413 align:middle line:84%
the certainty faith doesn't
wobble around.

00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:45.083 align:middle line:84%
It's not one day I'm, you know,
I've got a positive message

00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:47.785 align:middle line:84%
and the next day I've got
a negative message, no.

00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:50.088 align:middle line:84%
It's an unshakable
state of being.

00:49:50.088 --> 00:49:53.091 align:middle line:84%
In sand script -- the old sand
script word is called "nisjay,"

00:49:53.091 --> 00:49:57.595 align:middle line:84%
where you can walk
through the fire without faith,

00:49:57.595 --> 00:50:02.033 align:middle line:84%
without sacred-hearted
faith, and knowing this.

00:50:02.033 --> 00:50:07.338 align:middle line:84%
And you are immune to
a wall, absolutely.

00:50:07.338 --> 00:50:08.639 align:middle line:90%
You're immune to it.

00:50:08.639 --> 00:50:12.877 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we need is
that vibrational certainty,

00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:17.381 align:middle line:84%
that vibrational solidity,
based on love and faith.

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:20.885 align:middle line:84%
And then we can accommodate
evil easily.

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:24.555 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean, it's
like it's not a big deal.

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:26.491 align:middle line:84%
You naturally feel that
because you're in touch

00:50:26.491 --> 00:50:28.059 align:middle line:90%
with your eternal nature.

00:50:28.059 --> 00:50:31.162 align:middle line:84%
It becomes much smaller
than a grain of sand.

00:50:31.162 --> 00:50:35.199 align:middle line:84%
It's like I was saying about the
lens of the camera, the soul,

00:50:35.199 --> 00:50:41.372 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to be
like the ego, and just look

00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:44.509 align:middle line:84%
at something under a microscope,
which is like what a lot

00:50:44.509 --> 00:50:47.044 align:middle line:84%
of the conspiracy
researchers do.

00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:50.581 align:middle line:84%
We can wind the lens
back, right back --

00:50:50.581 --> 00:50:51.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Lilou: And see
the big picture.

00:50:51.716 --> 00:50:53.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: -- and see
the really big picture,

00:50:53.918 --> 00:50:57.455 align:middle line:84%
and understand that yes,
consciousness is in danger

00:50:57.455 --> 00:51:02.460 align:middle line:84%
of being trapped,
enmeshed in a sticky web

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:07.899 align:middle line:90%
of a low-vibrational matrix.

00:51:07.899 --> 00:51:10.168 align:middle line:84%
And millions, and millions,
and millions, and millions

00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:13.671 align:middle line:84%
of souls are stuck in
that web right now.

00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it is absolutely horrible,
dreadful, dreadful suffering.

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But what's the point
of me getting

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.783 align:middle line:84%
into the vibrational
feeling state of that?

00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:28.252 align:middle line:84%
All that does is make
me stuck in there.

00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:29.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Yes.

00:51:29.387 --> 00:51:30.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Good: We need
to liberate ourselves,

00:51:30.655 --> 00:51:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't mean
you have to move.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:34.825 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
have to leave your job.

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.761 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you have
to leave your family.

00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:40.565 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean you have
to change your diet.

00:51:40.565 --> 00:51:44.268 align:middle line:84%
What it does mean, though, is
that you have to start thinking

00:51:44.268 --> 00:51:47.038 align:middle line:84%
and feeling in a
completely different way,

00:51:47.038 --> 00:51:50.942 align:middle line:84%
and allowing your sonki,
this lens,

00:51:50.942 --> 00:51:54.378 align:middle line:84%
to go through an extraordinary
process of transformation

00:51:54.378 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:90%
where a tremendous amount

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.249 align:middle line:84%
of psychological
content will come up,

00:51:58.249 --> 00:52:00.818 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be
processed and integrated.

00:52:00.818 --> 00:52:03.788 align:middle line:90%
And that can be overwhelming.

00:52:03.788 --> 00:52:11.229 align:middle line:84%
The toxicity, the discordance
that exist in the psyche,

00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:18.436 align:middle line:84%
that psyche is a name for
the mind, the feeling, body,

00:52:18.436 --> 00:52:21.639 align:middle line:90%
that is part of the soul.

00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:24.408 align:middle line:84%
It interfaces with the
spiritual part of our being,

00:52:24.408 --> 00:52:27.411 align:middle line:84%
and also the physical
part of our being.

00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's my psyche.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.514 align:middle line:90%
It's your psyche.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:35.486 align:middle line:84%
So the vibrational content
in there that is toxic

00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:39.657 align:middle line:84%
and discordant, is far
greater than the, you know,

00:52:39.657 --> 00:52:44.395 align:middle line:84%
toxicity that we
have in our bowels.

00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:46.797 align:middle line:84%
You know, it has
tremendous depth,

00:52:46.797 --> 00:52:48.933 align:middle line:84%
because the bowel
toxicity, the blood toxicity,

00:52:48.933 --> 00:52:51.936 align:middle line:84%
the organ toxicity is
just from this lifetime.

00:52:51.936 --> 00:52:55.306 align:middle line:84%
The psyche has the
ancestral content in there.

00:52:55.306 --> 00:52:58.576 align:middle line:84%
The soul has this
incarnational content in there.

00:52:58.576 --> 00:53:01.345 align:middle line:84%
And those are the levels
that we need to clear very,

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:05.016 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, because we are
in this thing called life,

00:53:05.016 --> 00:53:06.717 align:middle line:90%
and no matter what we hear

00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:11.756 align:middle line:84%
about how much control these
negative influences have,

00:53:11.756 --> 00:53:14.058 align:middle line:84%
they don't have control
over life.

00:53:14.058 --> 00:53:18.296 align:middle line:84%
All they do is dominate
and manipulate our world,

00:53:18.296 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the 3D world, and the
matrix part of that world.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.338 align:middle line:84%
You can exist in this
world in a reality that is

00:53:27.338 --> 00:53:31.375 align:middle line:84%
out of the matrix, and we
are here in a portal NoniLand

00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:36.580 align:middle line:84%
on the Island of Kauai, that
exists outside of this matrix.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.815 align:middle line:90%
We live in grace here.

00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:39.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Lilou: Out of the grid.

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:40.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Nick Good: Yes.

00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:44.555 align:middle line:84%
And there's off-the-grid
physically, electric and water

00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:46.424 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it,
being solar powered.

00:53:46.424 --> 00:53:49.193 align:middle line:84%
And there's off-the-grid
psychologically

00:53:49.193 --> 00:53:52.463 align:middle line:84%
and psycho-spiritually,
and psycho-emotionally.

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:55.066 align:middle line:84%
And that's very, very, very
important to make that shift.

00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:58.936 align:middle line:84%
So this is the depth of
the nature of the thing.

00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:02.406 align:middle line:84%
So I hope I'm presenting
this in a practical way.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:05.476 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying it's easy,
but I am saying it's simple.

00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:10.514 align:middle line:84%
And what I am saying is, is that
if you listen to your guidance,

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
if you really take the
time to connect with life,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.152 align:middle line:84%
if you spend more
time in nature,

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:17.822 align:middle line:84%
more time nurturing
yourself, doing the things

00:54:17.822 --> 00:54:21.125 align:middle line:84%
that you know are right and
good for yourself, understanding

00:54:21.125 --> 00:54:25.563 align:middle line:84%
that there is a trap being
set, and many, many, many,

00:54:25.563 --> 00:54:29.033 align:middle line:84%
many individuals are caught in
it, and that the consequences

00:54:29.033 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:84%
of being caught in that trap are
extremely serious, not a joke,

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:38.576 align:middle line:84%
no guarantees whatsoever, none
at all, and I don't care what,

00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:42.213 align:middle line:84%
that you are going to get a free
ride out of there, or, you know,

00:54:42.213 --> 00:54:44.849 align:middle line:84%
airlifted out of there,
or rescued in some way,

00:54:44.849 --> 00:54:46.550 align:middle line:90%
no guarantees whatsoever.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:50.454 align:middle line:84%
It's down to you as an
individual to orient yourself

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:53.724 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way to liberate
you from that right now;

00:54:53.724 --> 00:54:55.426 align:middle line:90%
right now you can do that.

00:54:55.426 --> 00:55:00.131 align:middle line:84%
And yet you can shift back
into it in the next moment,

00:55:00.131 --> 00:55:03.501 align:middle line:84%
you can allow your mind to
wander, your imagination

00:55:03.501 --> 00:55:07.671 align:middle line:84%
to change its form, your
feeling state to shift

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:10.708 align:middle line:84%
and become emotional reactive
and judgmental, and get back

00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:12.276 align:middle line:90%
into the denial, or whatever.

00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:14.678 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can.

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:16.280 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
your responsibility

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.115 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual
warrior comes in,

00:55:18.115 --> 00:55:22.153 align:middle line:84%
is to keep practicing
self-mastery, awareness

00:55:22.153 --> 00:55:24.388 align:middle line:84%
and attitude, awareness
and attitude, awareness

00:55:24.388 --> 00:55:25.790 align:middle line:90%
and attitude all the time.

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.427 align:middle line:84%
Those are the only 2 controls
that we have over our psyche.

00:55:29.427 --> 00:55:31.529 align:middle line:90%
Where's my awareness right now?

00:55:31.529 --> 00:55:35.232 align:middle line:84%
Am I just shutting down and
just talking to the camera here

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:90%
from my perspective on reality?

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Or am I actually open and
really connected in my heart

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to the eternal nature of
things, and I can feel the flow,

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.112 align:middle line:90%
flow through my being.

00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:51.982 align:middle line:84%
And I feel the love
and that real beauty,

00:55:51.982 --> 00:55:54.485 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of the grace
that is all around us,

00:55:54.485 --> 00:55:56.921 align:middle line:84%
and laps against the
shores in my soul.

00:55:56.921 --> 00:55:59.123 align:middle line:90%
I can literally bring myself

00:55:59.123 --> 00:56:05.596 align:middle line:84%
into a different vibrational
reality than myself if I shift

00:56:05.596 --> 00:56:08.065 align:middle line:84%
out of that and start
stressing about things.

00:56:08.065 --> 00:56:10.367 align:middle line:84%
Completely different
world living in.

00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:13.337 align:middle line:84%
And so this is grace
versus, you know,

00:56:13.337 --> 00:56:15.039 align:middle line:90%
ignorance, living in ignorance.

00:56:15.039 --> 00:56:18.042 align:middle line:84%
And this is precisely
the teachings of Jesus

00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.977 align:middle line:84%
when he boiled down
the Ten Commandments

00:56:19.977 --> 00:56:22.947 align:middle line:84%
to love the Lord thy God
with all your heart and mind

00:56:22.947 --> 00:56:25.683 align:middle line:84%
and soul, and love thy
neighbors yourself.

00:56:25.683 --> 00:56:29.320 align:middle line:84%
He's just saying love thy
invisible almighty presence

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.356 align:middle line:84%
with total commitment,
all the time 24/7,

00:56:32.356 --> 00:56:35.292 align:middle line:84%
and just go out and
do good things.

00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Do good things.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.595 align:middle line:90%
Help people.

00:56:37.595 --> 00:56:40.264 align:middle line:90%
