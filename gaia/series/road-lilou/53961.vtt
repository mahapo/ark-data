00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:07.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Hello my
juicy co creators.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I am traveling around
the world, and today I'm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
in France with-- you're actually
living in Los Angeles right?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Right now?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all around the
world, Stephanie, right?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE SOUTH:
All around the world.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:90%
All around the world, yes.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.442 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:31.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: We feel
completely blessed

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:90%
to have you in France today.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And this was an amazing
conference that you just

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
have delivered, I guess,
was the translation.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to
speak of your work.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So you were in couple
with Jose Arguelles right?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yes, yes, yes.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And-- but
he passed away.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:90%
First of all, this relationship.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:10%
Before we go into accessing
this multidimensional--

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.638 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>>SOUTH: Well, it was a very
unique relationship, I think.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:10%
It was based on knowledge, and
it was based on something--

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:10%
when we first came
together, it was--

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:10%
there was a telepathic rapport.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
And we remembered something.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Like a sacred covenant.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We remembered something,
and then began

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.361 align:middle line:90%
a series of transmissions.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
When we came together,
we would look

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:90%
at each other just like this.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was as though
a portal opened

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and all of this knowledge
started to pour through.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was startling
to both of us.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And it rearranged both
of our lives completely.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And a whole new knowledge
base began to come in,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and we did this-- the
initial transmissions

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:90%
were over a 260 day cycle.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Every day we would
sit at the same time

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
for about three hours,
and just listen.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us,
I want to hear all

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.300 align:middle line:84%
about this
information, of course,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people,
especially on Gaiam TV,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
this is a community
that is very interested

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:90%
and wants to grow spiritually.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And there's this real thirst.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel this change,
is it really happening?

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Well, I'm
experiencing it.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
I can't speak for
anyone else, except

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:90%
for the direct experience.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I do want
to say is it's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:84%
all about the
power of the dream.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:90%
The power of the dream.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
As a child I prayed.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I prayed, show me what is new.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I want a magical life.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Show me what is new.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to live in this
world like there's-- nothing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:90%
inspired me in this world.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, I always prayed,
show me what is new.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was led on a magical path.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%
You know how that is.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Like the secret
doorways start to open,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's only-- we only know
through our direct experience

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:90%
of what it is.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the magical
pathway that opened for me.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Just to link back the
work of Jose Arguelles.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the work that he
has done throughout his life.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Because he really
put on the calendar,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.452 align:middle line:84%
didn't he, this 2012 date,
the 21st of December.

00:03:01.452 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Though it was coming
from the Maya,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.357 align:middle line:90%
he had a close relationship.

00:03:04.357 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: He did, you know.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was often very
controversial, as we know,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and very misunderstood,
actually.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%
What he was actually--
what he was actually doing,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and what was actually out
there, from my vantage point,

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
were two different things.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Because what he was trying to
do is promote a 13 moon, 28 day

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
calendar, which was
not really a calendar.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a matrix of unification.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It was a unification
matrix that included

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
all the other
calendars within it.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.967 align:middle line:84%
So there is no trying to
replace one with another,

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
though he was trying to replace
the Gregorian calendar, that's

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.760 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
He was trying to do that.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But it was far
more vast than what

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
people imagine, or his level
of knowledge was very galactic

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%
and far more vast.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And this so-called
calendar is just

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to raise your frequency to open
you into this vast realm called

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
the synchronic order.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Go into this, please.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.069 align:middle line:84%
So how did your relationship--
what kind of knowledge

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%
started to come in?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.736 align:middle line:84%
Because you start
remembering some things eh?

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:09.318 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.947 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Right when you met him,
or what was your life before.

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:90%
How did that--

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Well, you
know, I always knew.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:90%
I always followed the dream.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I always followed
the secret path.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The way that I met
him was in 1998

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
at the Whole Earth Festival
in Davis, California.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:84%
He had started
that in 1970, when

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:90%
he was an art history professor.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but how I
was introduced to him

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:90%
was somewhat unique.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
My partner at the
time was the head

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Padmasambhava Buddhist
Center in Portland, Oregon.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had had a dream
that he was supposed

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to go honor Jose as a Terton,
or hidden treasure finder.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I accompanied
him, knowing nothing

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:90%
about any of this.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Knowing nothing about
the Maya and nothing

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
about the calendar or anything.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I first heard him speak
then, and I felt something,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't until 2002 when
everything began to open.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Right.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And for you the-- because
you have a specific,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
you call it the Maya
consciousness, no?

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Because it's--

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: We call
it Galactic Maya.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Not to be confused
with indigenous Maya

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:90%
or any cultures.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the higher
dimensional knowledge

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
that transcends all
the nationalisms or all

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:90%
of our boundaries.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's what unifies all of us
at the higher galactic level.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.512 align:middle line:84%
It's what unifies all
the different traditions,

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:90%
all the different prophecies.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
This is all about unification
and unity consciousness.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So how
could we-- what's

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.823 align:middle line:84%
the teaching, or the process,
or how to access that?

00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Well, the teaching is
to-- changing our relationship

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:90%
with time, and what time means.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.060 align:middle line:90%
That time is not linear.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Time is not a clock.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Time is not the calendar.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Time is a radial matrix.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a circle.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, just imagine a
mandala, and at the center

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:90%
is the one divine source.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:90%
God, or the Universe.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The source energy is at
the center, pulsing out.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So past present and future
are pulsed out simultaneously

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
in this radial matrix of time.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And so in this radial
matrix of time,

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
space is an infinitely
locatable point.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Now that means that-- so,
any space you can travel to,

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
past, present, or future, if you
view time as radial, a circle,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:90%
the feminine cycle.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, we're just
being re-educated now

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:90%
on the true nature of time.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.455 align:middle line:84%
Time travel, like everybody's
interested in time travel.

00:06:37.455 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Or teleportation.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And getting our
magic powers back.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
what I'm here for.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So, but
tell us how does

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
this look like on a day
to day basis, you know?

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: That's why he promoted
a 13 moon, 28 day calendar,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.600 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
a synchronometer,

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:90%
a measure of synchronicity.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
To give people something
to connect to day to day.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a calendar.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
It's to enter you into
another consciousness.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you start
there just to give you

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
something to access
daily to attune you

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:90%
to a higher dimensional order.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
frequency, symbols.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a code.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And these are
symbolic structures

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that vibrate at a higher
resonance or frequency.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So by engaging
those structures, we

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
begin to vibrate at
a higher frequency.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Earlier on
during the conference,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
you were speaking of the
third, fourth, fifth, you know.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And beaming in that fifth.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Tell us, can you
tell us that again?

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: OK, so what we
worked-- the three bodies

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:90%
which we all have.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Our third dimensional physical,
biological, conditioned,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
five senses body
that we all know.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And then our fourth
dimensional body.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to understand that
that's our ethereic body,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or that our thoughts that
are interconnected right

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:90%
now are invisible realm.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with us
in the invisible realms?

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the fourth dimension
is the realm of our dreams,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%
intuition, deja vus.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the fourth dimension.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the fifth dimension
is our pure electronic body.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Because we're pure electricity.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It's our divine blueprint,
is our fifth dimensional--

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
like our holy guardian
angel that we're

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
aspiring to merge with and
to become, and to become

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
our highest self, is
the fifth dimension.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
analogy that we use.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty easy
to understand in

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're all trying to
integrate those three bodies.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Not to push the
third dimension away

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.549 align:middle line:84%
in favor of just going
to higher consciousness.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to integrate all of
that into our daily life,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and to really work with
our emotional bodies

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:90%
in order to up level that.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.015 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we can
access the higher dimensions.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.232 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: How many
dimensions is there?

00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: I think there's
many, many dimensions.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
We work with the 13
dimensional model.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And the 13 dimensional model--
we're in the third dimension

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:90%
here, right?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the seven-- it goes
fourth dimension, fifth, sixth.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension is
like the angelic realms.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the seventh
dimensional is

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
like the speaking
tube of the source.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there's mirror
universes that fold over.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The 8 through 13 fold
over on one through six.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can see everything
folds up like a book.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything is an
overlay of dimensions.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, many people work
with-- that's not the only way

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
to work with it,
but it's the way

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:90%
that's easiest to understand.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Other people work with
18 dimensional, 21.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've had experience with
this 13 dimensional universe,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.530 align:middle line:84%
actually, when I was writing
the latest synthesis, or book.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And so, I know it's real.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:90%
It's from direct experience.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- that's what's
different about this path,

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is because it gives
you codes and a system

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.417 align:middle line:90%
to have direct experience.

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
we're all seeking.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.377 align:middle line:84%
It's not just some theory,
these like-- you can feel it.

00:10:01.377 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, so
tell us, I want

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to get more into
your world, you know.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And feel what it is like.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Can you translate that for us?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Going into-- how does it
feel, what does it look like?

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:90%
What do you do there?

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:90%
What for?

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: You're talking
about the inner world?

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.663 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Well first, I feel
like we're all here

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to bring more light
to this world.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And we all know that the
way that this world is,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
there's-- like I said,
when I was a child, I said,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
show me what's new.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Like, I didn't have any
career that I wanted to be.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And you may have
felt the same way.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.174 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you look
out there, and it's

00:10:38.174 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:90%
like, everything's been done.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:90%
What can I do, or how can I do?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, what was granted
for me, and to others,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
who I think had a similar
prayer, is a new knowledge.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It gives you brand
new perceptions.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Like the way that I
perceive the world.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.532 align:middle line:84%
I think it up levels
your perception,

00:10:56.532 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
so that you're not just looking
at it through tunnel vision

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:84%
from your-- just
your 3D daily dramas.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at it
from a cosmic perspective

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:90%
of our place in the cosmos.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So you're not just concerned
with our little lives

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.599 align:middle line:90%
that we're living down here.

00:11:10.599 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we're living out
several other dimensions

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.209 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's comforting
to think about.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not just this.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It's many other
things simultaneously.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're just waking up
to this multidimensional

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:90%
being that we are.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are everything,
each of us.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.063 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Going through
around the world, you know,

00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I get to meet people that
are working on the ley

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.125 align:middle line:84%
lines, or the Earth,
and helping the Earth,

00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and helping this transition.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the work?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Oh, completely.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of the work.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Jose's vision was of the whole
Earth becoming a work of art.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So basically, instead of
time is money, time is art.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, the Earth is our
greatest art project,

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and we're supposed to
make it a masterpiece.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.600 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
All of those, the
ley lines, everything

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
is being activated right now.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
The pyramids are all connected.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything is totally connected.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think right
now, more than ever,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, 2012
passed-- for myself,

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:90%
that was an inner event.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I noted many changes
occurred after that for me.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:84%
But not in the same
way as all the hype

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:90%
that you hear about it.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It was more of an internal,
personal, personal thing.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And then July 26, 2013 we had
a ceremony in Mount Shasta

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to open the doors to
the new galactic beam.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Or the new information
that's coming in.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're all-- I
think many of us

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.486 align:middle line:84%
are starting to feel there's
a new energy that's coming in.

00:12:41.486 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us
about those beams.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: So the galactic
beam, that's a -- like,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine that, how
does new knowledge come

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to our planet?

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
How does new knowledge--
how do we get new ideas,

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
or how does new
knowledge come in?

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this,
the galactic beam,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
new knowledge is focalized
from different star

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
systems like Sirius,
or the Pleiades.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
They have higher
intelligence than we do.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And when the time is right,
they focalize new energy to us

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:90%
through the sun.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Through the sunspot cycles.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Through the solar flares.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it activates our
DNA, and up levels us.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we're open to
receive, I know a lot of it

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
is coming through the dream time
right now, where I've actually

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.433 align:middle line:84%
been dreaming new animals
that I've never seen before.

00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, and you
just start thinking,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:90%
what are the new colors?

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
How can we-- what is new?

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.494 align:middle line:84%
That's always been
my lifelong journey.

00:13:35.494 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: The new songs that
you were saying earlier.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: The new songs.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the new music.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%
The music of the future.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.211 align:middle line:90%
What's the new art forms?

00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Because this world
as we know it,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
you can see how much suffering,
and how much depression,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and we need new visions.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:90%
We need something exciting.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We need something
totally new and alive.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is
just-- for myself,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:90%
I just share the information.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that I'm, like,
wanting anybody else to do,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But just sharing that I've had
direct experiences with working

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.686 align:middle line:84%
with this system
that are incredible.

00:14:11.686 --> 00:14:12.269 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
latest teachings?

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I know you're completing
the seventh, is that right?

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: I completed that.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
It's called the--

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: He asked
you to complete it?

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.233 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So he passed away in
2011, before 2012.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
None of us could believe
it, including me.

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
We were living very
secluded in Australia,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:34.430 align:middle line:84%
finishing-- doing a lot of
internal experimentations--

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:90%
drug free.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Internal experimentations
with different states

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
To see-- just to see what
effect that it might have,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
working a lot telepathically,
and to put more light

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
into the planet.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, when he left, we were
living in the Australian Bush,

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.639 align:middle line:84%
and he asked me to complete
the seventh volume.

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
I was going to do it,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.976 align:middle line:90%
it's very advanced material.

00:14:58.976 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It took tremendous
concentration.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But he told me he
would help dictate it

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
after he crossed over.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in a
deep place of suffering

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
and I heard him.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And I completed it.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So I felt really,
really, happy that I

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:90%
completed what we started.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is this part of
connecting to other dimensions,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
To be able to have these--
I mean, where is he--

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.342 align:middle line:90%
where is he?

00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, he's
in another dimension.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:84%
In multi dimensions, I
think, simultaneously.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.746 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So are you able to hear
him clearly through the dreams,

00:15:35.746 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:90%
or when did that happen?

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: I had
him-- right after he

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:84%
passed away, I could
feel him a lot.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I used to-- I could
hear his voice,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I could just-- I
felt him very close.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, he was with
me through the time

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
that I completed
the seventh volume.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:90%
I would hear him say, OK.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, put this
graphic over here.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.226 align:middle line:90%
Go get this notebook.

00:15:53.226 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, this is the piece
of information that you need.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Because, when I look
at it, there's no way

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:90%
I could have done it alone.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.587 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it.

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And some
of that information?

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: So, the
final teachings were

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:84%
called something that's
called-- it's a cube.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
It's working with-- it's
all a mathematical system,

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:84%
This whole system
is a very elegant

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:90%
symmetrical mathematics.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Like it's all number.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- number
is vibration.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's very scientific,
and very systematic, actually.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So, the final teachings
that I'm working with now

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
are what's called
the cube matrix.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And what that-- how
that translates,

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and how I've seen
it in my dreams,

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is that we're being inserted,
like, with a new nano chip,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better word,
into our mind, a new program.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
A new, something
that's up levelled.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is working
with that matrix,

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:90%
because everything is a matrix.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything is number.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, working with
this specific matrix.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, ultimately, we
have to become the internet.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
the internet in our--

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
like I was saying at the talk,
that all technology was first

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.920 align:middle line:90%
thought in our mind.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
We have the power.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We have the power, and
ultimately, technology

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.291 align:middle line:84%
can only get so small, until
you have to go to telepathy.

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:17.874 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
So this is like the
transition for us

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.130 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond what we think
we're capable of doing?

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Exactly.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.109 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
working with our mind

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what
can we really do?

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%
What are we really capable of?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And what are these-- We've
done different telepathic

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
experiments, actually, with
some of the Russian scientists.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We just did one
for the third year

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:90%
anniversary of Jose's passing.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of different,
like, telepathic experiments.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We have different
communities that

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
were practicing different
telepathic experiments,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
because we've barely
utilized our mind.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's like, these
are systems in order

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to experiment with different
levels of telepathy,

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of time travel,
teleportation eventually.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And all this is really
possible through our mind.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't need a
machine or technology.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I haven't heard you
talk about the heart yet,

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.689 align:middle line:84%
but I guess it plays
an important role.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.105 align:middle line:84%
And you love that
topic don't you?

00:18:16.105 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, it's
my favorite topic.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.876 align:middle line:90%
And yours, too?

00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:90%
No, it's my favorite topic.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
No, like we said at the talk,
that the number one, the number

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
one precept to all
of this is love.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Love above everything.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Because without love,
knowledge is dead.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing without the heart.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can't-- all of this
knowledge that came was born

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:90%
through love.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
This whole seven
volume series was

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
born through tremendous
love and trust.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Jose taught
me unconditional love.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And what people
don't know, like,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
he was so loving,
and so-- and, only

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:84%
through unconditional
love-- I didn't know.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.371 align:middle line:90%
I was 29 when I came into this.

00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:90%
When I came in.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But I knew immediately
that it was my destiny.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And he-- we started at the
very, very top of information.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So I was studying,
meditating, all the time.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Just nonstop.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And locked in my room
for hours and hours.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And after he passed away,
I spent a year and a half

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in mostly solitude in
the Australian outback.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, only recently have
I come into the world.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
I was going to do it.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I just-- I prayed a lot.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: And living
from the heart is truly

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:90%
a place that feels great, right?

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We're connected then
to all dimensions.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that a portal, too?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Absolutely.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Like we were saying,
you can't even

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
talk about higher dimensions
if you're not first in love.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're not first
connected to the heart.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And like we said, it's
like clearing the heart,

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and loving, and really
embracing everyone.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we
have to work with everybody,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:90%
or do-- you know.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We work with people,
but we know in our heart

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:90%
that we're all one.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And that we know that there's
this deep, profound love

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
that we feel, and this
interconnectedness

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.400 align:middle line:90%
with everything that lives.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is--
in the connection

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
with the creator is that's where
all this knowledge comes from.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Like, it couldn't-- you couldn't
just have knowledge without

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
having love.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:90%
To me, it goes hand in hand.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And to me now, but
it's like, it's

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously the
heart and the mind.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We do have to develop both
of them simultaneously.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really get
here until you're here.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're just,
like, cold and dead.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: What is your advice on
dealing with these times where

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
we feel the energies
pouring down,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of shaking us, and
it could be difficult at times.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
It's been very intense time.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.372 align:middle line:84%
It's been a very challenging
time for many of us.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I know many people
are leaving the planet

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
right now through--
sometimes through suicides.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
There's so much depression and
things happening right now.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And all I can say is,
like, that we just really

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:84%
have to let go and surrender,
and let the higher force come

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
into us, and allow
ourselves to really

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:90%
be filled with the spirit.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way, because we
have to just get out of our way

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and let it come in.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.602 align:middle line:84%
Because I never thought--
there's so much,

00:21:15.602 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
there's so much
suffering, and there's so

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:90%
many people that need help.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're helping
so many people.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And like I told you
before, I love you so much.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
You've done-- I've
seen your work.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.100 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So, but yeah, the
love is the key.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
That's more important
than everything.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, that's
why it's through the love,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and through the wanting
to help other people

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:90%
that new things are coming in.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Because we need a higher vision.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
We need something higher.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
We need new knowledge
that inspires us

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and that up levels us, and--

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is there some
exercise, or some practices

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to do to open ourselves,
open our body,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
allow this energy to come
in, and to-- I guess rest

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.055 align:middle line:90%
is a big one.

00:21:59.055 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Right.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Rest is a really good one.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the exercise that
we were just doing, really

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
tuning into our third, fourth,
and fifth dimensional bodies.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
In our fifth dimensional
body, that's our pure love.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the pure love body.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the body that's our
unconditional friend that

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
never leaves us.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.367 align:middle line:84%
That always loves
us no matter what

00:22:19.367 --> 00:22:21.200 align:middle line:84%
we do no, no matter how
bad we think we are.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It always is loving
us all the time.

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And so, that's really important.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And in this path,
there's a whole series

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.570 align:middle line:84%
of exercises that
have been laid out

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to access, say, the fourth
or fifth dimensions.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can go as slow
or fast as you want.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
The first one is following
the 13 moon, 28 day calendar.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Sounds so simple, and so
deceptively like, what is this?

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But it really is
the doorway that

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
opens up to this
whole other realm.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.270 align:middle line:84%
There's many practices on
our website, lawoftime.org,

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and in all of these--
the cosmic history

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
lays out a lot of
different lessons.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.285 align:middle line:90%
But the heart is number one.

00:22:59.285 --> 00:22:59.785 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:59.785 --> 00:23:01.535 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, because
sometimes the heart

00:23:01.535 --> 00:23:04.450 align:middle line:84%
it takes to simply lay down
and ask for help, right?

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.587 align:middle line:84%
There's many beings
ready to help us.

00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:84%
My visualization, or what
always helps me if I feel,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
if I feel really
overwhelmed, especially.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one right now.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Because we can never
get it all done.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.310 align:middle line:84%
No matter how hard we
try, the to-do list

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:90%
grows and grows and grows.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.266 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:23:23.266 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so what I always
visualize myself bowing down

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to the light, to this light
that's way bigger than me.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
And I just say, I give up.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.440 align:middle line:90%
I surrender.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Please guide me and
help me because it's

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:90%
impossible to do this alone.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to go
through this time right now

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and not be completely depressed,
or addicted to something,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.390 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, if you
don't have the spirit.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're saying, it's

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.701 align:middle line:90%
a time to return to our essence.

00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, and
to be open to receive

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:90%
the help from the invisible.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has this
capacity, or this access,

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
or conscious access,
I should say,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
to multidimensional levels.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But at least we can
be open to receiving.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.373 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a favorite prayer?

00:24:07.373 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I have many, many
prayers that I do.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I do the seven line-- the
prayer to the seven directions.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:90%
I do the seven line prayer.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I do a Muslim prayer, a
Christian prayer, a Buddhist

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:90%
prayer.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I like to incorporate all
of the different energies

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:90%
into the morning practice.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I love to design
my own morning program

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that I change a lot
of times so that you

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:84%
can feel all the
different energies of all

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.430 align:middle line:90%
the different people.

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and I want to say about
this multidimensional-- it's

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:90%
not-- it's just what we are.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just so-- it's actually,
really, it's our wholeness.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just us returning
to our wholeness.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not even
anything-- it sounds

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.980 align:middle line:84%
like, wow,
multidimensional, far out.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's really just us, like,
just surrendering to the moment

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.092 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the
wholeness to come in.

00:24:56.092 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, it seems
there's a lot of steps

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of exercise.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I remember having conversations
with Drunvalo Melchizedek,

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and there's this and that to do.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it gets quite
complex or overwhelming,

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
when we really want to
live in the present moment.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.399 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: I completely
agree with that, too.

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Can we get any more
simple, like, more simple,

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:90%
and more-- can we?

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:17.468 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: You know what?

00:25:17.468 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's all
becoming so simple now,

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that it really, really, is.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Like all of these
practices and codes,

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
these were-- why
do we do all those?

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:90%
First.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do them?

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.200 align:middle line:84%
We do them because
we're raising--

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to
raise our frequency

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on something
other than our daily dramas.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:84%
To concentrate on
something else,

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:84%
on increasing our
continuing consciousness,

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
so that we're able to stay
conscious at a higher level

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:90%
for longer.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a means to an end.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately all that,
none of it-- ultimately,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:90%
everything is illusion.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And we all go back to
the source, to the light.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But while we're here,
we're given-- some of us

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
are given to develop our heart
and our mind simultaneously.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But I completely
know what you're

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:84%
saying, that sometimes it's just
so overwhelming, that we just

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:84%
want to-- and getting into
the sort of feminine cycle,

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
now we want to just-- we've been
so do, do, do, do, do, go, go,

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
go, go, go, we're just
ready to just like, be,

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and to relax, and
to be nurtured now.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so that's all true, too.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Yeah, and it
seems too, that it's just

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
a matter of receiving,
too, sometimes.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.909 align:middle line:90%
And being-- opening up to it.

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:29.450 align:middle line:84%
There are some special places
around the world that you love,

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Mount Shasta is one of them.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
There are some places
where we receive more.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on in those places?

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mount Shasta, I feel,
is a really special place.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like there's
different-- I believe

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
in the intraterrestrial
civilizations there.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences through my
meditations, and I feel them.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from five
weeks in Mount Shasta.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.245 align:middle line:84%
Or I came, there,
LA, and then here.

00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:90%
But it was so powerful.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I forgot how inspiring
and empowering that is,

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
to go to such a pure
place, where the water,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:90%
you can drink it from the tap.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's crystalline, and
you-- pure water is gold.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Pure water is the most
wonderful, wonderful thing.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, there's many
different sacred spaces

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about us
returning to our essence.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.989 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Tell us more of
that intraterrestrial?

00:27:24.989 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Well, I believe that--

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Activity,
what is going on?

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe that
they're monitoring us

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:90%
in a benevolent way.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, trying to give us
help in telepathic messages

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
when they can.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But right now, they
don't want to come

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of the
Earth because it's

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
too violent and aggressive,
and there's too much

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:90%
suffering here.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.899 align:middle line:84%
And so they're working
within the core of the Earth.

00:27:46.899 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, within the
center of the Earth.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is a crystal
core at the center.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And so there's--
Jose used to say,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:84%
"Within the Earth
is another Earth.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It knows us, though
we know it not."

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, there's another Earth
that is residing in there.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.950 align:middle line:84%
There's civilizations in there,
just like our star brothers

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:90%
and sisters are here.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, they're
all over the place.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We're the intermediaries
between heaven and Earth.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I also heard
that we have multi--

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
like, the universes
are out there.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
Many, many, universes.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
some inside, and it

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.193 align:middle line:90%
gets smaller and smaller inside.

00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:25.839 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: Well,
that's interesting.

00:28:25.839 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That we
were-- I mean, we're

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:90%
just-- it's just a big hologram.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much going on.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.365 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: It is.

00:28:31.365 --> 00:28:33.649 align:middle line:84%
It's a big hologram, and we
need some more ventilation

00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:34.315 align:middle line:90%
in the hologram.

00:28:34.315 --> 00:28:36.930 align:middle line:84%
To puncture some
more light in there.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.482 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but I believe all that.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But when things become too
complicated, and we have,

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, star systems,
dimensions, everything, I just

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:90%
go back to the One.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Go back to the One,
and then start again.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.786 align:middle line:84%
And then see what
the One tells you.

00:28:51.786 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, you just
surrender back to the One.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the information starts
kind of whispering itself in,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:58.990 align:middle line:90%
and it builds on itself.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, we
have an internal GPS

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.400 align:middle line:90%
system when we just listen.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it tells you
what to do and where to go.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Is nutrition,
food, something

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.017 align:middle line:84%
essential in being conscious
and open and receiving?

00:29:14.017 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Totally, totally.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm vegetarian.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Mostly vegan.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
that's a huge thing.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.920 align:middle line:84%
I know for myself, you just
want to get lighter and lighter.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:84%
You just want to feel lighter
and lighter and lighter.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
key minerals, and we

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.070 align:middle line:90%
know that our soil is depleted.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's a whole
person, whole system.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to account
for all parts.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Not just our mental, not
just our emotional, but we

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:90%
have to do all of it.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Mental, emotional,
physical, everything

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.365 align:middle line:90%
is part of our wholeness.

00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.467 align:middle line:84%
I see you drink a lot of
water when you speak, eh?

00:29:47.467 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: I'm trying.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Don't forget,
you're conscious.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.120 align:middle line:90%
You stay there.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.953 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: I'm trying.

00:29:50.953 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been so dehydrated
after the plane ride.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: No, that's
interesting to observe.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I love this moment.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.477 align:middle line:84%
So is there some
particular aspects

00:30:02.477 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
of the teaching that
you would like to talk?

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Though before that, I just
have a little question

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
regarding the extraterrestrials.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Your relationship?

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: With the
extraterrestrials, yeah.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:90%
How should I answer?

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.505 align:middle line:90%
Which part?

00:30:17.505 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Do you
connect with them?

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you have experiences
at something?

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you receive
information from it?

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:90%
What is your--

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: So, well, my initial
activation, and how I met Jose,

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and how I was led to him
was through my first visit

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico in 2000, when
I went to Palenque.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And the night before--
we were with nine people,

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and the night before, the
sky was full of ships.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen them
before, and we all

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.460 align:middle line:84%
saw there was a big
mother ship in the sky.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I could not only
see it, but I felt it,

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:84%
like activating
and reverberating

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.860 align:middle line:90%
through my whole body.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like this sound that was
going through my whole body.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, I was taken

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to the tomb of Pakal Votan,
the tomb of the Red Queen, all

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:90%
the different tombs there.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that-- and
I had a vision there

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of how all of the
pyramids are connected

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
through this electronic
lines of force.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And that when all those
were fully connected,

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
then our planet lights up
and the game board changes.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:23.302 align:middle line:84%
And so, that was through the
UFO then, when I was living in--

00:31:23.302 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Jose used to see
them all the time.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:90%
He was a contactee.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:90%
He would always receive.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:84%
He would receive what
he called opticals.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of his information came
through opticals, where--

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.680 align:middle line:84%
he didn't drive anymore,
because his field of vision

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:84%
would go out, and he would
just see geometrical shapes

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and pulsations and lights
that he would draw.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And then for like
two weeks straight

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:84%
he would be downloading
incredibly dense information

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
that was received.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So, after he passed away, about
a year after he passed away,

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:90%
I was praying.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I was on a meditation
retreat at my place.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Doing work, catching up on work.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I went outside and I saw
four ships right above-- right

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:90%
outside my house.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And at first I thought,
are those really ships?

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.478 align:middle line:90%
Are those really ships?

00:32:07.478 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And then I felt them again.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And it told me that I had to
leave everything in Australia,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:84%
after seven years, to leave
everything in Australia

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and go to Palenque
for December 21, 2012.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And I knew if I left, I
couldn't re-- I would never--

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't return.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't return.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I just had to go.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So I've been basically
traveling ever since that.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I ignored the message at
first, and they came back.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Three days later,
they appeared again.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And I got the same message,
and I got information

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.820 align:middle line:84%
about the star Sirius
simultaneously,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.310 align:middle line:90%
that these were pulsing me.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so, a lot of these codes are
connected with, say, the mother

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:90%
ship.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.410 align:middle line:84%
That's been my experience
through the dreams.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:84%
That these cube codes are
like part of the control

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
panels of the mother
ship that's been shown

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to me through-- my
medicine is through dreams,

00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.920 align:middle line:90%
or clairvoyant dreams.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's how--
before I met Jose,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I would dream a
man was teaching me

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
time travel in many different
locations all over the planet.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, and then
I met him, and I

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:84%
saw his face was the same
as the man in my dream.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, many things
like that happen to me.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So when my night
dreams would start

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to blend with the
daydream, and so that's

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:84%
what set me on my
journey, and I got help.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.412 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I got help.

00:33:23.412 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: No, but how do you
deal with all this information?

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
lot to deal with.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:90%
How do you integrate all that?

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SOUTH: It's my
whole life, see?

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Because, since 2002, it's
literally all I've been doing.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I was given-- I knew
it was my responsibility

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to receive this
transmission, and I

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
knew it's what I had
waited for my whole life.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, it was like--
a divine covenant

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is the only way
that I can say it.

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew it was
something I was remembering

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
from another universe,
another place.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And so-- and a lot of times,
I would put the information

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.650 align:middle line:84%
under my pillow and dream
about it, and things like that.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of meditation
and a lot of study.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But I just knew
that it was my path.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, what
happens after a period of time

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:84%
is it starts to
put you together.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:18.633 align:middle line:84%
Like, it, so you know how you
study, and you're thinking,

00:34:18.633 --> 00:34:19.549 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is laborious.

00:34:19.549 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
I'm like studying and
studying and studying.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm meditating
and meditating.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
in a flash, you get it.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And everything makes sense,
and you feel completely whole.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're just, like,
that's what this is.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%
It's like, these
are memory codes.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, what keeps
you inspired doing

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.310 align:middle line:84%
them is they keep tapping
different memories

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.257 align:middle line:90%
of other worlds, other times.

00:34:40.257 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And it would just keep
opening me up, right?

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:84%
When sometimes it was very
difficult and very strenuous,

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:84%
because I gave up my whole life
for this information, and to be

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:84%
the carrier of this
information, which

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.250 align:middle line:84%
is known as the GM108X,
or Galactic Mayan Mind

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Transmission.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Gotta have something
new to talk about.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah, I like that.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is how it's called.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.329 align:middle line:90%
This is how you call it?

00:35:07.329 --> 00:35:07.912 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:35:07.912 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's called, yeah.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The GM108X Galactic
Mayan Mind Transmission.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's what would
happen when Jose and I would

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
get together, it was
like, we locked in,

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and we were transported
somewhere else.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And we became, you
know, you could

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.610 align:middle line:90%
see every being in each other.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:26.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can--
because each of us

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
contains the full-- each
of us contains everything.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.150 align:middle line:84%
All of the-- everything's
inside of us.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And so, when two people come
together and recognize that,

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:90%
that's powerful.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: So whether
we remember or not,

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe people time travel,
but they don't remember it.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.201 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we wake up in the morning,
but something has happened.

00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: There's many more
of those dreams, yeah?

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Those Akashic records that
all of a sudden those past

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
lives, that we can
remember all of that, but--

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: It is so, I mean,
it is quite something

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to hear this
information, from my end.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And then to integrate it.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering how you're
doing to be in this reality

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, I know, I know.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.217 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Is it boring?

00:36:14.217 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, because everything--
I'm never, ever, ever, bored,

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Like, everything is fascinating.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.877 align:middle line:84%
And it's like everything
is new all the time.

00:36:22.877 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how
we're supposed to be.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Where everything is
new all the time.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's not-- to me
it's natural, I guess,

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
just because I've been
doing it for so long,

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's really my whole--
I don't do anything else.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, we unplugged for a period
of time of media, of everything

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.750 align:middle line:84%
like that, in order to
explore something new

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:90%
for the human race.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.877 align:middle line:84%
Like, what is possible,
what can we do?

00:36:46.877 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you one
example, I don't know,

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:90%
are we good on time right now?

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you just a real
time, or a real life example.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.180 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing
this synthesis,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
accessing your
multidimensional self,

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in Hawaii
on the big island.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was working on
the part of dimensions.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
get really heavy.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It was so much information.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And that happens a lot, OK?

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.340 align:middle line:84%
You get really, really, heavy,
and I went and I laid down,

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and I realized, when
you shift dimensions,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
there's almost like a
sound that you feel it

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:90%
through your solar plexus.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
palpable, it's like

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:90%
chr-chr-chr-chr-chr-chr-chr.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Like you can feel it.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And I realized, wow.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was half dreaming, half
kind of in a hypnagogic state.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm in
the seventh dimension.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the-- like the
speaking tube of God,

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
the mirrorless resonator at the
center of the mirror universes.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
You'll-- once
I've-- and then, OK.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So then, I got, like, spit out
into a mirror universe that

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
was exactly like we're
experiencing right now,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:56.450 align:middle line:84%
but it was us in a really
slowed down mirror universe.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.390 align:middle line:90%
We were so whole.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything was so loving.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were whispering things
to ourselves over here.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Saying remember, do this now.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, but I knew
it was the mirror universe.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I was reading the
same book that I

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.560 align:middle line:84%
was reading in this
universe, which

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.750 align:middle line:84%
was Yogananda, The
Second Coming of Christ.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:90%
I love that book.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I was reading that
in this mirror universe,

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and I realized, wow,
this is for real.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, we can really
access these.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.060 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I
was out for two hours

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and there was a 5.7
earthquake in Hawaii.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.576 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel anything.

00:38:33.576 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And people were--
when I got out of it,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.470 align:middle line:84%
people were emailing me and
everything, and I thought,

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.200 align:middle line:84%
is this what
happened to the Maya?

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.720 align:middle line:84%
They shifted dimensions,
and so they-- I said,

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.160 align:middle line:84%
would this be helpful for
the coming world events?

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.602 align:middle line:84%
For us to be able to know
how to shift dimensions?

00:38:48.602 --> 00:38:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Those are the thoughts
that I was having.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.644 align:middle line:90%
So just to give you a real time.

00:38:51.644 --> 00:38:53.393 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: That becomes
real practical then.

00:38:53.393 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a real time example.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:84%
But this is all, for me,
very direct experiences.

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can have them.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Because like, I grew up in a
trailer park with my father.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I didn't--
all I had was my inner dream.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.627 align:middle line:90%
All I had was the inner dream.

00:39:09.627 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:11.626 align:middle line:84%
And you must feel
so good to-- now

00:39:11.626 --> 00:39:14.630 align:middle line:84%
being able to express
it, and share it.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we, sometimes
a lot of people

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.150 align:middle line:84%
have to go through this time,
where as a kid you suppress it,

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.650 align:middle line:90%
eh?

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:90%
It does feel good to share it.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Although I really
relish my internal time

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:84%
more than anything,
because it's so rich.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.647 align:middle line:84%
And I share if I'm called
to, but I don't seek it.

00:39:34.647 --> 00:39:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: Anything else that
you would like today, as far

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:84%
as maybe relationships,
or the sacred feminine,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.850 align:middle line:84%
or whatever speaks to your
heart right now to say.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Well, that's the key.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The masculine and the
feminine, of course,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is the key to
absolutely everything.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
this whole process

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that Jose and I were undergoing,
was the transmission of, say,

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
knowledge from the masculine
to the feminine, symbolically.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were doing
to balance the scales.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's at the
root of everything.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
The harmony between the
masculine and feminine we know.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the key to
healing the planet.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Because when the masculine and
feminine is in total harmony,

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:14.800 align:middle line:90%
there won't be any more war.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There won't be any
more prostitution,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.880 align:middle line:84%
which is fed by-- which
comes with the war.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like sex and death.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two
things that we're

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.320 align:middle line:84%
overcoming on this
planet, or that we're

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:90%
redeeming on this planet.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Sex and death, false
spirituality and materialism.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: And we're fearful.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: And were fearful, yeah.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: So many things.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:10%
>>SOUTH: I know, I know.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're here to help people
not be so fearful anymore.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Getting all this knowledge
and information out,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:48.650 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully creating a
loving space for everybody

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:52.590 align:middle line:10%
to be, and to share, and to
know that whatever experiences

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.150 align:middle line:10%
that they're having,
that are not so far out.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:84%
That we're all
beginning to have them,

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.167 align:middle line:90%
and I think more and more.

00:40:59.167 --> 00:40:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: Yeah.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for opening
up and having the courage

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.550 align:middle line:84%
to speak your truth,
and share with us.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it
takes a lot courage

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to get to be there
in that place.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah, I think so.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.214 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, and for
everything that you do, yeah.

00:41:16.214 --> 00:41:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LILOU: You are so welcome.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.231 align:middle line:90%
>>SOUTH: Yeah.

00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>>LILOU: I love
you, much much love.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Delicious co creators watching
this video, thank you.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Please comment.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Put some of your
thoughts in there,

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
or other information,
maybe that you have.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't hesitate.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the
conversation rolling.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Much, much love.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:48.374 align:middle line:90%
