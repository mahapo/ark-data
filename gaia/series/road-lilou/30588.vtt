00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Hello, [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Windsor in
the United Kingdom.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.571 align:middle line:84%
Here with Linda.
Hello, Linda.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Hi.
How are you?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to do another
interview for Gaiam TV.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.065 align:middle line:84%
You are the author of
"Marmalade and Machine Guns."

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I certainly am.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:90%
It's just come out.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Exciting.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.435 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting.

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:90%
A new baby.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm a new author.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a new baby.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And it literally was
like giving birth.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.834 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to speak
about what you have learned

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
through-- well, I think in '96,
there was some serious events

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that happened in your
life that made you realize

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:90%
that there was so much more.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%
That this life was so much more.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have reinvented
yourself, if I can say this.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have done
huge humanitarian work

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even Richard
Branson said Linda

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:90%
makes the impossible possible.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.949 align:middle line:84%
What a great adventure.
My goodness.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.360 align:middle line:90%
You've met Richard Branson!

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I have.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had the honor of meeting
him many times actually.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.275 align:middle line:84%
And being-- working as
a consultant for him

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:90%
in-- for community projects.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So he knows what I
can do firsthand, yes.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great honor that
he wrote that on my book.

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:19.714 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
[CLICKS TONGUE] So tell us
what-- tell us about your story

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
so we can understand
where you're coming from.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people are changing

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
their lives-- want
to live and give,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:90%
but where do we start from?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So it helps to-- for
us to hear stories,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:90%
because then we get inspired.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
So what is yours?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You have quite a special one.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, from a very young
girl, I always felt that I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:90%
had a real big purpose in life.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
But I had absolutely
no idea what it was

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
or however I was
going to do that.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Fell in love when I was a
young girl when I was about 16.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And married my Prince Charming
and had two children when I was

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:90%
quite young in my early 20s.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.905 align:middle line:84%
And went and became--
my career was a nurse.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely
adored my nursing.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But became a single mom at
a very young age, as well.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't practical
then to remain as a nurse,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
because sadly salary as
a nurse is not very good.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.187 align:middle line:84%
So wanting to be a super mom and
to do all the things that we do

00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and take care of the children
and make sure they had

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
everything they
needed, I took the step

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
of taking a job which
gave me more money

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and a company car and-- and--

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.926 align:middle line:90%
Stress.

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I did it, because of
all the right reasons.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But I forgot to understand
what it was doing to me.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I-- so I'd actually ticked
all the boxes for my kids.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I had enough money.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do
this, but I was--

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
I transitioned into a job.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I was actually working for
a pharmaceutical company,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
because they love nurses because
we have the knowledge and also

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.541 align:middle line:84%
the ability to share the
wisdom of different drugs

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't realize the
stress it was putting me under.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But because I had
to be super mom

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and do all the
things I had to do,

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I just let that--
I just buried it.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I pushed it down.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I tucked it under the carpet
and just thought, never mind.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Just get on with it.
You're fine.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And of course it wasn't.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And the years went by when I was
pharmaceutical repping-- two,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:90%
three years.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.471 align:middle line:84%
And then I really
got my wake up call.

00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
It was like, you're
not going to listen

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to how stressed you are so your
body is going to shout at you.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So I was-- I'd actually attended
a big conference-- a sales

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
conference in the
north of England.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And desperate to get
back home and to get away

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
from all the hype
and stuff that I--

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't sit well with
me, I thought I'd just drive.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:90%
I just gotta get home.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.923 align:middle line:84%
So it was in the
middle of the night.

00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I started to drive home.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And as I was driving
on a motorway--

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.911 align:middle line:84%
and this was before the time of
mobile phones-- I went blind.

00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And--
-This is what happened in '96.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.006 align:middle line:90%
That happened in '96.

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- I mean, I must have
had a flock of people around me

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit world that
were taking care of me.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Or someone was,
because I managed

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to pull over on the side of
the road and stop the car.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And the shock that I'd
actually lost my sight.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:90%
It was dark.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
It was-- it was winter.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It was like 2 or 3
o'clock in the morning.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:90%
No mobile phones.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't communicate
with anyone.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly my life had
been taken away from me.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that really
was my-- that was

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:90%
my turning point in my life.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
That was just that
moment where I thought,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
well, you know, what now?

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:90%
What have I done?

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
to deserve this?

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Why me?
Wha-- the fear, the shock.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Every-- my whole life
had just been taken away.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:90%
So it was a hard experience.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have anything to do
with out of body experiences

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.395 align:middle line:90%
or beautiful feelings of-- no.

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:90%
It was horrifying.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely--
I mean, I was scared.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:90%
I was fearful.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I was angry.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I was-- it was everything--
all those hard emotions all

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
came to me at the same time as
I sat there on the hard shoulder

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.991 align:middle line:84%
thinking, wow.
What now?

00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
What's happened?
What's happened?

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And disbelief.
You know, why?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
What?
You can't.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, rubbing your eyes.
Why?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:90%
It can't have happened.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of-- and
nothing had led up to it.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- I hadn't
had blinding headaches

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
before or-- and so
that was a really,

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:90%
really super tough moment.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine sitting
there just thinking,

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:90%
oh, well, my life was over.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.767 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see.

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you just think
of all the things--

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't see your children.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be able to see--
wouldn't be able to do my job.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:90%
How was I going to survive?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything was just
going through my head.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, in
hindsight, that actually--

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
it was that moment-- that
experience has enabled--

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
has enabled me to do everything
else I've done in my life so--

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
What change have
you made from there?

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
regained your eyesight.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.291 align:middle line:84%
But something-- it
didn't come back, though.

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.223 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
interesting, because I

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:90%
sat there for a few hours.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And because no mobile
phones, and I had no sight,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I just literally sat there.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And after about two or three
hours, my sight returned.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine the
blessings, the thankfulness,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
the-- God, I'll-- I will look
at my life now and see what went

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
wrong, what I'm doing,
and-- and I remember

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:90%
driving home thinking, OK.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I will really
look at what my life's about

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and where I really
need to change things.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, the
only place to start to change

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
is yourself.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.511 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never been on the
trail of personal development

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:90%
before ever.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd always been such
a-- I love my kids.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I love being a mom.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I had
that time, I was-- just

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
immersed myself in family life.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But I thought,
it's all about-- I

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:90%
have to start to change myself.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
My children were--
it wasn't like I

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
could just give up my job
because my children weren't

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%
of that age.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
I still had to be able
to fund their lives.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:90%
So I just thought, all right.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's start and change
things wherever I can.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And I read something in the
newspaper about, you know,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.275 align:middle line:84%
come to this be
positive workshop.

00:07:14.275 --> 00:07:14.975 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- I've got to go.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was a day's workshop.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
like that that

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
really gave me the
appetite that actually

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:90%
it's so simple to change.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
start to analyze,

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
become aware of who we
are and what we're doing.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And I realized-- I would
sort of take a 24 hour period

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and how I actually--
what was happening

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:90%
to me in that period of time.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
listen to my phone

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%
calls I was making to people.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And 90% of the words that
both me and the person I

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
was on the phone
to were negative.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about bad
things that happened to us.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:90%
We complained.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:90%
We moaned.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, god, and how
long have I been doing that?

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was such a wake
up call, so I started

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
to get this awareness of all the
negativity that was around me,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
even as much as from looking
in-- reading the newspaper.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.286 align:middle line:84%
I was opening the
newspaper every day,

00:08:09.286 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%
just putting on the radio.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.504 align:middle line:84%
And it was still
all negative stuff.

00:08:12.504 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
pick up the phone,

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and I'd tell people
about the negative stuff

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I'd read in the paper.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
complain about my job,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd-- and I just
thought, no, this has to stop.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So for about three
or four months,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:90%
I refused to read a newspaper.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.490 align:middle line:90%
I didn't watch the news.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't turn on
the radio to listen

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:90%
to any of this negativity.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware
of my own language.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And every time I started to
use a negative word or a word

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:84%
with any negative connotation,
I would literally seal my mouth.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I'd stop.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like I
would-- I had this--

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
it was a real
absolute commitment

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%
to stopping the negative words.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, even
if I would say,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to
say positive words.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would say, well,
I like this cake.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:90%
I thought, no, I don't like it.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So I would put the positive
emotion into something,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
even though it
sounded like it was

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:90%
over the top or exaggerating.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But to raise the
way I felt inside.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was really interesting,
because I felt the difference

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:90%
in myself quite quickly.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And then when people started
to notice the difference in me,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
it was really interesting.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd have
people who I'd had

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:90%
this moaning relationship with.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And like it didn't sort
of fit them anymore,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.361 align:middle line:84%
because they wondered--
well, you've changed.

00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter with you?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
What's happened?

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
quite threatening when

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:90%
one person completely changes.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the circle of
people I had at that time,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.065 align:middle line:84%
we were fueling each
other with negativity.

00:09:44.065 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And it was quite interesting.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So I actually had to distance
myself from some of my friends

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and family that I'd had that
relationship with, because it

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:90%
wasn't helping me at that time.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
how to deal with it.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.093 align:middle line:84%
So I literally went
on a negativity fast.

00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.292 align:middle line:90%
I went on a positive diet.

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:06.121 align:middle line:84%
You were probably
silent at that time then.

00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting how--
but the change-- and I was--

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
but I always felt
sorry for my children,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because they were-- must
have been about-- say,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
13 and 15, something
like that at the time--

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:90%
maybe slightly younger.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But they had this mom
who wouldn't allow

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
the word no in the house and
wouldn't allow any negativity

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:90%
or complaining.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:90%
I would just turn it around.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, oh, come on.
Let's just get on with it.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.179 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at
the bright side.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd sing all
these positive songs

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and put positive records
on and fill the house

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
with sort of comedy
and-- I just had to-- it

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:90%
was a real shift in energy.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just went 100%
full out to do that.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I managed to
turn myself around so quickly.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So then the job could not be
the same-- that your friends

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:90%
were not the same.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You started having, of course,
different conversation--

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.516 align:middle line:84%
attracting different
things, I guess.

00:10:58.516 --> 00:10:59.215 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally.

00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is the most
exciting thing-- is that once

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
you do make that shift.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say it's not
that difficult, because it was

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
only becoming aware actually
of what you're saying

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:90%
and what you're doing.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But when I started to
change, of course, it

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
was really interesting the
different people I did meet

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and the different way I had
to manage my day at work.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I was still stressed at
work, because I realized

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%
I was completely off my path.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't doing
what made me happy.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So it made me start
to become more

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:90%
aware of what made me happy.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I wasn't at
work, or when I had

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
time to be with the
children, I would

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.110 align:middle line:84%
make sure I was
filling those moments

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:90%
with things that made me happy.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.755 align:middle line:84%
And that for me was-- you
know, sitting down one night

00:11:41.755 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and writing a list--
actually what makes me happy?

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:90%
When was the last time I did it?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Gosh, well, let's try
and do it this weekend.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.105 align:middle line:84%
Let's get out in
the countryside.

00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the beach.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was-- I'd
forgotten to actually

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
incorporate those things into
my life that make me happy.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing
I would say to anyone.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the key key to making
your day, your week,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
your year the best it
can be-- is remembering

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.050 align:middle line:90%
what makes you happy.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think we get so caught
up in what we should be doing

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
or where we should be going
or who we should be with,

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and we stop thinking--
remembering what

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%
makes us as individuals happy.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's my one
very important tip.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Honoring that all the time.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And because we-- I guess we also
reinvent ourselves continuously

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:90%
once we're in this process.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Then we need to check
that back again and again.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
That is so true.
Constantly.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:90%
And I do that even today.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most days
when I wake up,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:84%
I-- I have this sort
of positive journal

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that I've always kept
doing ever since then.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I will just make sure
I check in with myself.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I would say almost every
day unless I'm in, you know,

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
some bomb territory, because
I do front line aid work.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I'm not
able to do that writing.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, I will make sure I
start my day thinking, right.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, what-- where am I?
What am I doing?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:90%
What's making me happy?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
What's in my day that's
going to be really fun?

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And make sure there's
something every day

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.772 align:middle line:84%
that's really honoring that
side of me that makes me happy.

00:13:07.772 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.924 align:middle line:84%
You spread it on
then to everyone else.

00:13:09.924 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
-Yeah.
-It's contagious.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a magnet for other good
things and for other people

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to allow them to be happy, also.
-Yeah.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
On the cover of your book,
we see kids-- happy kids

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:90%
laughing and-- and being kids.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Where-- where were
you right there?

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about your
humanitarian work.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I-- I've
been a humanitarian aid

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
worker for 12 years.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I always work with
the private sector.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm absolutely
passionate about it,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
because the private sector
are the most underused

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
resource in development work.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And they are-- they have such an
amazing approach to challenged

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:84%
communities and
to aid development

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
that-- it's something
very, very important to me.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So all my aid work,
I've worked with them.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I've covered very big disasters,
like the Asian tsunami in 2004

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.471 align:middle line:84%
that most of us remember who
were, you know, at adult life

00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And Boxing Day
2004 when Asia was

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:90%
really turned up on its head.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in Pakistan, and
that's the picture on the book.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.120 align:middle line:84%
After-- because I
was-- I got noted

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that I did some really good
work with the private sector

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.271 align:middle line:90%
after the tsunami.

00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they asked
me to go and speak

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
at a conference in
Pakistan to inspire

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the business
leaders there as how

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:90%
they could make a difference.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got
first introduced.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And the big earthquake
had happened in Pakistan.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I have this
very strange trait in me,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and my friend comment-- she
said, when everyone else is

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
rushing out, you're rushing in.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
So when there's a big
disaster or a problem,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
I know that I have to go.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that's in me.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So when the
earthquake happened, I

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
knew that I had to
go and-- and spread

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
this word of how the private
sector could make a difference.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And in Pakistan, I was there
from about 2007-- 2006, 2007,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:90%
2008.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:90%
for two years.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And they've-- they
had many different

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
complications happening at that
time apart from the earthquake.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:90%
They had cyclones and floods.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a lot of
very, very poor areas.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to really
get out onto the front line

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and make a big difference
in many different ways

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.870 align:middle line:90%
while I was there.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:84%
What do you-- what have--
what were you telling

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.120 align:middle line:84%
those business-- those
entrepreneurs-- the people

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
there that you were
talking to on how

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
situation and-- and start

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:90%
their business back again?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
How-- was it difficult
to find the words,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
or were you just really
just so tuned in that you

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
were-- we want to hear this.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we always feel like
we're having, you know,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:90%
really big challenges.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at huge challenges,

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
then we kind of feel--
it's comforting,

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time, it can
give us a lot more energy

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and creativity to
go on with our lives

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and so that we can
free ourselves up, too,

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to help others.
-Yes.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I-- throughout
my aid work,

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
my philosophy is a hand
up, not a hand out.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I've seen too many communities
become beggars because

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
around the world, especially
when there's a big disaster,

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:84%
of course in the
emergency phase,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
it's absolutely essential
that we have this outpouring

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
of gifts and-- and items
that people can then

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
start to recover,
whether it's water,

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it's blankets,
whether it's tents.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's a level when
you have to say right now,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
we have to make them
independent again

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and rebuild their own lives.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's so, so important.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I do and what
I help to coordinate

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is the private sector to be able
to come in and help to see how

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
there are market opportunities
for those people who

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:84%
have lost everything to be
able to rebuild their lives.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.490 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you one story.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
After the Asian tsunami,
I was working in Thailand.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And the area that was
hit there was really

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
a very high tourist area.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was many of the
hotels that were hit

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and were washed away.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
So as a nurse, I was there
right at the beginning,

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to help
in a first aid way.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So I was staying in some of the
survivors' camps and helping.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I could
see was that there

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was so many people
who had previously

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
worked in the hotels.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.460 align:middle line:84%
They were the gardeners,
the bell boys, the cleaners.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was when
those hotels were washed away,

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
their livelihoods
were washed away.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And those hotels were
not going to be rebuilt

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time if ever.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And when they started
bringing me their children

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and saying, Linda, can you
take care of our children now?

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like the alarm
bells were ringing.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Not a chance.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we must come in and start
to see how these people can have

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
their dignity and
their self esteem

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
back and be able to really
earn their own money

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and look after
their own children.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
So what did I do?

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I went back to
Bangkok, and I gathered

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
businesspeople together.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want you to come
with me to the front line.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And with your
business approach, I

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:84%
want you to look at the people
that we're trying to help-- so

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
their education level, their
skills set, their abilities,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:90%
their capacities to learn.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Look at the environment.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Look at the-- the market
opportunities for something

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:84%
they can do as
entrepreneurs to earn

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
their own money to be able
to stand on their own feet.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:90%
So it was wonderful.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.830 align:middle line:84%
They came with me, and
it was still very soon

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
after the big disaster
so I knocked on the door

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
of the head of the Admiralty.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And this lovely Navy chap
gave me two helicopters.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.321 align:middle line:84%
So I flew these people
around the worst hit areas.

00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:84%
We landed.
They spoke to the villagers.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:90%
They visited the villagers.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
They looked at the
environment and the geography.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Then they went back to Bangkok.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Within about three or
four days they said,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:90%
we've got some ideas.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:90%
We've done some market research.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
think could work.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And what they had seen, which
I wouldn't have seen as an aid

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
worker-- they
noticed that lining

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
the coast where the
wave had hit were acres

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:90%
and acres of rubber trees.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And these rubber trees had
been ignored for many years

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.237 align:middle line:90%
because of tourism.

00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:90%
What's a rubber tree?

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, because English
is my second language.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.005 align:middle line:84%
Rubber trees-- basically,
it's rubber on your shoe--

00:19:17.005 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
like the soles of
your shoes and soles

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:90%
of your trainers, that's rubber.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And what it was is that their
grandparents had harvested

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
rubber from the trees.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
You-- all you need
is one sharp knife,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and as you score the tree,
the white glue like rubber

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
You then sort of add
a few bits to it.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:90%
You make it into a big sheet.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:90%
You put it through a mangle.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And you have rubber
that you can then

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
sell to the shoe
factories, to whoever uses

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:90%
rubber-- for tires, whatever.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And the businesspeople
had noticed

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that there was this resource
that had laid dormant.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.901 align:middle line:84%
No one had used it
because of the--

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Tourism.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
 --easy money, easy money
to be made from tourism.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And within weeks, we just gave
this idea to the community.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They said, yeah, we-- yeah, of
course we know how to do it.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But-- you know, our
grandparents had done it.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
How much money will it cost for
you to start up in business?

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, we need one knife,
and we need a mangle,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:90%
which might cost $100.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
They were back up and running.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
They were earning four
times the amount of money

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
they earned as a bell boy,
gardener, or a cleaner.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:90%
They were independent.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
They were earning-- they
were successful entrepreneurs

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:90%
within months.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I went back two
years later, three

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:90%
years later, five years later.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They were still
successful entrepreneurs.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
That is why I'm so
passionate about bringing

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the private sector in
to make a difference.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So when I go-- whether I
go to Pakistan, whether I

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:90%
go anywhere in the world.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got to
work with Richard Branson.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's really using
the private sector,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
because they have such great
skills that they are very

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:90%
successful in business with.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And they make their
profit-- you apply

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:90%
that to a challenged community.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:90%
It's win-win for everyone.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
How exciting for those
entrepreneurs, as well,

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
to get their brain
together to help, to serve,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:90%
to-- to find new ideas.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their heart must have
totally opened up, as well.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And it must have
changed their lives.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I have
just recently launched

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
something called Be the
Change, Business Leaders

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
at the Frontline.
And why?

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that this-- I've
seen it work so many times.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I love-- it
is totally win-win.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Because they go, and
it's not about money.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Be the Change, Business
Leaders at the Frontline--

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
we're not asking for
money as a donation.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
We're asking them to come and
use their brilliant brains

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But when they come
and they visit--

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and I've just come back from
a trip to Nepal where I've-- I

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
took two heads of
corporates and two self

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
made millionaire entrepreneurs.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And they came with me
to the high Tibetan

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
area on the Nepal border.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And they went from
their five star life,

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.070 align:middle line:84%
of course-- they're very,
very successful businessmen--

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.930 align:middle line:84%
with me, and they
basically lived in a cave

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
for two or three nights.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They had-- there was
no running water.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:90%
There was no electricity.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.416 align:middle line:90%
No sanitation.

00:22:05.416 --> 00:22:06.582 align:middle line:84%
We could make a
TV show right now.

00:22:06.582 --> 00:22:07.406 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:90%
And what superstars they were.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Within days, they--
because of the way

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
they think and they
know and they approach,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
they had water projects
happening and on--

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and women's empowerment
projects happening

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
with crafts and many--
just skills development.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they came
down from this village,

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
they all said to me, our lives
have been changed forever.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we really
know-- we appreciate

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the unconditional love that
we were shown up there,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the generosity of the people,
the happiness of the people

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:90%
who have nothing.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And each of them said
to me-- and to camera--

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%
that it had changed their lives.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Now to me that is a real
blessing and a real win-win,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
because these people-- they
are the engine of the world.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.930 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones that
manage thousands of millions

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
of people themselves
in their own right.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And they had such a
happiness and such a spring

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
in their step when
they came down

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
after having made such a huge
difference to the community.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And also the effect it
had on their own lives.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So the gratitude and the
blessings for all those things

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:84%
that are happening is-- it gives
me my-- my passion, my purpose,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.480 align:middle line:84%
my reason of being-- my
reason of being alive.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I've
devoted my life to.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
What advice would
you give to people

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
looking for their life purpose
that want to contribute?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Where-- where
shall they look at?

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.760 align:middle line:90%
Where shall we look at?

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, always start at home.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Always start at every single
day you wake up in the morning.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.805 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm really getting
passionate about this

00:23:37.805 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that it's to do
with our attitude--

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
how we can make a difference
to anyone's day at any time.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, smile
at the bus driver.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Smile at the girl
at the cashiers.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Give someone a compliment.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:90%
That we can do so easily.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:90%
It costs absolutely nothing.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But the difference it
can make to someone's day

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and the domino effect it will
have-- number one-- is huge.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So with your-- and even if
you're feeling a bit down

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
or grumpy yourself-- just
because you've turned around

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
yourself to be a bit
positive to someone else,

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
it'll come back at
you in bucket loads.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first thing.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Start in a very simple way,
but in a very practical way.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe that
when you have that ability

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.425 align:middle line:84%
to serve someone
sometime during that day,

00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's making
them a cup of tea,

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's helping them
do their hair for them

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
or-- just little bits
of service will start

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:90%
to then grow in your life.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And that abundance
flows back to you.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to do things
like I do and actually look

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:84%
to actually help communities
which are very much less

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:43.550 align:middle line:84%
fortunate, in the
back of my book

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I've given some
agencies that I feel are

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.160 align:middle line:90%
doing a very, very good job.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But there's-- if you
look on the internet,

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you look in the resources that
you have available to you now,

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
there is always
somewhere you can help.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And do look.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Get out there and look.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:90%
Find out.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Ask people.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
People always come to me,
like after the Asian tsunami.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of a
resource for volunteers,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
because everyone knew that it
didn't matter who they were.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I would place them somewhere.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is another little
story I'll tell you,

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:84%
because I think this absolutely
shows that every single person

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:90%
can make a difference.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So after the Asian
tsunami, and I

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
was in the survivors' camp
where there was so much grief

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:90%
and-- and disaster.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
OK, what would really

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:90%
make a difference here quickly?

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there were so many
children, orphans that had been

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
penned in case
they were kidnapped

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and all that sort of thing
that happens after a disaster.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And I thought yes, I know.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:90%
We need magicians.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:90%
My father's a magician.

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather's a magician.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a magician actually.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But it came to
me, and I thought,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call the
head of The Magic Circle

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and see if they'll
send someone out.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I spoke to my
father, and my father said,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Linda, you're crazy.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.601 align:middle line:84%
You're in one of the biggest
natural-- global disasters

00:25:58.601 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're asking
for a magician.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
What can a magician do in
the site of a disaster?

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I said, trust me.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Just trust me.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So I spoke to the head
of The Magic Circle.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And he said, come on.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.775 align:middle line:84%
You know, no one's going to
go out into a big disaster

00:26:12.775 --> 00:26:13.560 align:middle line:90%
area like that.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, just put the word
out amongst the magicians.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what's-- see
if anyone responds.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:90%
One guy did.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And within weeks,
this magician had

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
flown out with all
his magic wands

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and his colorful balloons.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Language-- no problem.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
No communication problem
whatsoever, of course,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:90%
with magic.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And he stayed for six weeks.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And he moved up
and all the camps.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
A magician in the heart
of the biggest disaster

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:90%
we've had for many, many years.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the healing that he
did in those communities--

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the smiling, the
laughter that started.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of art therapy
was happening,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and the colors were
changing from black to blue

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:90%
as they started to heal.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And while I was out there,
because the buzz was so great,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Winston Churchill's
granddaughter, Arabella

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Churchill, called
me and said, Linda,

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got a mobile circus.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I bring it out?

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So we had clowns, and we had
fire eaters and stilt walkers.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And the humor.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, laughter is
the best medicine.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Humor, kindness,
smiling-- it heals us.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So I always say never think that
you-- whatever your life skills

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:90%
are, you can make a difference.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
As the magician did.
-Beautiful.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:84%
How would you define
leadership now?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that changing?

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel leadership
is changing?

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel we need a
new type of leaders?

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
How would you define leadership?

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
interesting question.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Leaders now, I believe and what
I see in the business world--

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.800 align:middle line:84%
the ones that really lead
with-- from their heart,

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as from their
head, when they have that--

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that combination of both,
that is where a people will

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:90%
do more for them than ever.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.960 align:middle line:84%
They'll-- they bring
out the best in people,

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
as well as bringing out
the best in themselves.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I believe
leaders-- and I'll give

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:90%
this-- another little story.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.365 align:middle line:90%
I love stories.

00:28:07.365 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:90%
You're good at that, too.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:10%
When I was working with KPMG
after the tsunami-- and they

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:10%
were just tremendous.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And they allowed their
staff to take some time

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
off one day a week,
one day a month--

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
just bits and bobs to
be able to help people.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And these were
visionary leaders who

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
knew that it was a time for that
outpouring of love to be there

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and to actually be part of that
repairing this-- the disaster.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
About six months after
this had been taking place,

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and they hadn't been helping
that much but a little--

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the global chair of
KPMG came to Thailand.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And he spoke at a
conference there

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and to thank the
people that had helped.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but
there was a very

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.785 align:middle line:84%
strange thing happened while
you were all out there helping.

00:28:53.785 --> 00:28:56.452 align:middle line:90%
Our productivity went up.

00:28:56.452 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but you
were working less hours.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
realization from companies

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that the more we feel good
about being able to help others,

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
it actually makes us-- the
feel good factor is huge.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're able to give
the best to our work

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
when we're actually really
sharing the best of ourselves

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and really making a
difference to other people.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And I like these
really tangible results

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that companies and
business leaders have seen

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that is the combination
of heart and head

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that really brings
the best results.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you see other big
corporations like that that

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.660 align:middle line:90%
are doing these kind of things?

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I know KPMG was
very big in keeping,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:84%
I guess, some of
their employees,

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:90%
or Deloitte's, as well.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But is there-- even though there
was a crisis, they-- you know,

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:84%
is there other big
corporation like that?

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I have witnessed
and worked closely

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.411 align:middle line:84%
alongside Virgin-- incredible
company for doing that.

00:29:57.411 --> 00:29:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Manpower also.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there
are many, many others

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that I haven't worked with
who also do the same thing.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But there's loads
more we can do.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- you
know, I feel now

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that this is such an important
part for all business leaders

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and companies to
embrace, because it's

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:90%
such a win-win situation.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it can have such--
I think you even-- I think

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.850 align:middle line:84%
the companies even attract,
you know, the most successful

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:84%
people to work for
them when they have

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
that attitude of giving back.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very attractive
thing for companies to do.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I think-- for
example, with my Be

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the Change-- when people are
able to have an experience,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
it grows them in so many
ways when they're completely

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
out of their comfort
zone, when they're really

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:84%
being able to help
communities which

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:90%
they would not normally meet.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
It's probably far better than
a lot of the communication

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.630 align:middle line:84%
exercises or the human
resource exercises

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that they do within
their own country

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%
within their own people.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And it--

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.210 align:middle line:90%
The team buildings or the--

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And it probably-- within three
days with me on the front line,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:84%
you could probably,
you know, cut

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
down a year's training
in a general way

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:90%
because it's so intense.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a big
shift they have.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're making
such a big difference

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to the challenged countries--
areas we have in the world.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- I believe
this is what's going to make

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:84%
the biggest difference in the
world-- when we start bringing

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:84%
these brilliant brains to really
look at some of the worst--

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
some of the seemingly
intractable problems

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.140 align:middle line:84%
that we have around
the world, I think

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
we've just got to apply these
brilliant brains to them

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.130 align:middle line:90%
to really make a difference.

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So that is why you have
created Be the Change?

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I love that
quote, too, from Gandhi.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.051 align:middle line:84%
Be the change that you want
to witness in the world

00:31:37.051 --> 00:31:38.190 align:middle line:84%
or see in the world.
-Yes.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It's-- it's Mahatma Gandhi,
and it's be the change

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:90%
you want to see in the world.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel if we--
each of us do that,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:84%
we each stand in our own light
and recognize our own skills--

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
skill of a magician.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:84%
That is a skill of
a business leader.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:84%
That is a skill of a
housewife and a mom.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- if we recognize our
own qualities and honor, which

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.340 align:middle line:90%
many of us aren't very good at.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We tend to put ourselves down.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:10%
But if we honor those qualities
and we use those qualities

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:10%
to make a difference and be
the change we want to see

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.680 align:middle line:10%
in the world, I
think it's a very

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.600 align:middle line:10%
powerful thing that
every single person--

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and the younger, the better.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I love, love, love taking
young people, also, as well

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
as my senior business leaders.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm a busy person.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.150 align:middle line:84%
When I take the school
leavers-- the 18-year-olds,

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:90%
the 20-year-olds.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Especially we know-- we've got
to-- we've got to recognize

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.940 align:middle line:90%
they are tomorrow's leaders.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we can affect people
at that age in their life,

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
then it will affect
their whole career.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And it will affect the way
they see and the way they lead

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and the way they live.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
So is there-- because the world
is kind of going a little bit

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
upside down right now--
do you see things--

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:84%
or what is your--
how do you vision--

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.900 align:middle line:84%
how do you see that things
are going to turn out?

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Or what things would you
like to see in the world?

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are scared.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a little
bit chaotic right now.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:84%
There might be even
more chaos soon.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.030 align:middle line:90%
What would you recommend?

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, to start with is-- is
really cut down on the fear.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Because actually, I travel all
the time all over the world.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked on the front
line in places like Pakistan

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:90%
and on the Afghan border.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in a lot
of conflict areas.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to know the
essence of each human being

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:84%
in each country,
whatever their religion--

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with every
religion on Earth.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in every type
of tradition and culture.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to, we're
all exactly the same.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:90%
We all love our kids.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
We all want to be happy.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We all have parents we
want to take care of.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.350 align:middle line:84%
We all need to have
a full stomach.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:84%
We all want to have
a good night's sleep.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And actually I really want--
I would love-- the more you

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.300 align:middle line:84%
really start to get to know-- I
love telling the Kenyan people

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Masai Mara tribe about
the lovely Pakistani women

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I know in Islamabad.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And I share stories,
because our lives--

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:90%
we have such crossovers.

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:18.129 align:middle line:84%
And we have such great values
to share with each other.

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think actually
we are one world.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:84%
There are all these
boundaries and divisions.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of fear that-- that

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.600 align:middle line:84%
gets built up through
misunderstanding--

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.719 align:middle line:90%
not understanding.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's my big thing-- why I
am passionate about doing talks

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.449 align:middle line:84%
to people-- inspirational talks
and to really get to understand

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:41.760 align:middle line:84%
different cultures
and-- and religions

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and to really see that
we're all the same

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:84%
and actually cut
down on the fear.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:84%
Because I have lived
in their houses.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I've-- when I go to a country,
I don't stay in a big hotel.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I live in the villages.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I eat their food.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.699 align:middle line:84%
I-- I go to their--
wherever they worship.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:90%
I go with them.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And I really-- I feel it.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I carry it in my heart, and
I can share this with people.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.785 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
minimizes-- why people

00:35:05.785 --> 00:35:06.885 align:middle line:84%
will go with me
to the front line

00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:90%
is because I've done all this.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I really have
worn the moccasins

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.940 align:middle line:84%
of most of the big societies
and countries in the world.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And I do have that
depth of understanding.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love taking
politicians with me.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:90%
I love taking Royalty.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I love taking business leaders.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:90%
I love taking young people.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
you understand what's

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.290 align:middle line:84%
actually happening
in the people--

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to the lives of those
people-- when you actually

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.425 align:middle line:84%
go and sit with
them and have a cup

00:35:29.425 --> 00:35:32.720 align:middle line:90%
of tea in their environment.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So the-- you are
a magician of life.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Could we say that?
No?

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are-- you think are
the ingredients or the things

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that we need to know
if we want to become

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
also magician in life?

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You talked about some of
them, but I feel we can all be

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:52.040 align:middle line:90%
alchemists and metal into gold.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And we have this capacity,
but we're not raised that way.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:56.540 align:middle line:90%
We're not taught that way.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
You were lucky
enough to be raised

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:90%
in a family of magicians.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And you had to make
your own decision

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and be courageous and step in.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:90%
But what makes a good magician?

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I-- I really feel
that the essence of it

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
is finding-- really trying
to get to grips of what

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.660 align:middle line:90%
you-- what makes you happy.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Because that will show
you what your purpose is.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You've constantly got to
get-- go back to those moments

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:84%
where you feel in your
happiest, most blissful state.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
That will give you the clue
to what really you're here

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:90%
to share in-- with the world.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Go back to the real basics.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And it could be-- whether
it's, you know, writing.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be that
you-- you know, you

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
lose yourself when you're just
writing stories about things.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's the way
you're going to share

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:90%
your gift in the world.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:84%
That's where your magic
is going to come from.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So I would suggest
to people is really

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to go back to those basics
of what makes you happy.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And then honor that and
find out how you can weave

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
that into your day to day life.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's likely to be that's
what your purpose is about.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you're living
on purpose with your passion,

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be happiest.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be able
to share that with the world.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Another trick I've
learned over the years--

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and when people say, well,
I don't know how to do that.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, well, tell
me who your heroes are.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very interesting.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:84%
When you start to think
who your heroes are,

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.200 align:middle line:84%
start to think what they've
done, what their qualities are.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.690 align:middle line:84%
It will then give you
another idea of who you are.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Because when you-- your
heroes are actually--

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.010 align:middle line:84%
those elements are inside
you or are about to be born.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
interesting exercise.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, I was-- I
love Florence Nightingale.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.970 align:middle line:90%
She was a nurse.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I love--

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:90%
And a mystic.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Alexandra David-Neel.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Great-- one of the first
female expeditioners to Tibet.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
courage, the bravery.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And because the people
that I admire-- actually,

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.050 align:middle line:84%
those qualities I see
are the ones that I

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.180 align:middle line:90%
am bringing out in myself.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:90%
So do that exercise.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Really start to look about,
you know, who are your heroes

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Another good clue is to
where-- what you're here for

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and the great qualities for
you to share with the world.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:84%
We can also think
of superheroes.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because--
you know, that's why

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.920 align:middle line:84%
we-- we-- most of-- well,
I think every single person

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
has heroes.
Yeah?

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:29.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people get
stopped by money.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I cannot contribute help,
because I need to pay

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the bills, or I-- I won't
have the money for such

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:90%
a big project or what have you.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.920 align:middle line:84%
What is your relationship
to money and to abundance?

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I-- I have a very
interesting life where because

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:84%
of my aid work I decided
that I would sell everything

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:90%
I own in the world.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:90%
So I don't have a house.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a car.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.080 align:middle line:90%
I literally have one suitcase.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:90%
That's all I own.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And I sleep at my friend's
house at the moment.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And I have lots of
friends all over the world

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:84%
so I'm never homeless,
but I don't own anything.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So material
possessions-- I've never

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.870 align:middle line:84%
had that relationship
with needing to have

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:90%
a lot of material things.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:90%
That's just a personal thing.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But what I would say
regarding abundance

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is that the more you
give of yourself,

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:18.440 align:middle line:90%
you really do receive.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean-- so
it's-- I actually believe

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:84%
abundance comes not
so much of giving

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:90%
money but from giving yourself.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally-- you can
give of yourself by saying

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
next time I'm with
my friend, I'm going

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to sit and listen to them.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
That is the biggest gift
you can give anyone--

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.620 align:middle line:90%
is just to be quiet and listen.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.650 align:middle line:90%
To smile at someone.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about-- it's really
being present and-- giving

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.600 align:middle line:90%
of yourself is a gift.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You could help people if you
don't have money to contribute.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my whole
thing is a hand up,

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
not a hand out means
it's not about money.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's about sitting with a child
and reading a story with them.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Sitting with them as they're
coloring in and talking to them

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and telling your stories
and sharing stories.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Starting with
the one around us.

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and that--
and the domino effect

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and the generational
effect-- you have no idea,

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.020 align:middle line:90%
but you give of yourself.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think--
and that costs nothing.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of the best things in life,
as we know actually, are free.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.830 align:middle line:90%
They don't cost anything at all.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Just get out into nature.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So don't ever think
money can ever stop you.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.650 align:middle line:90%
In fact, money is a blessing.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not against
money at all.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:33.920 align:middle line:90%
I think money is wonderful.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's absolutely
not something we

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%
need to be happy or abundant.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.870 align:middle line:90%
We just give of ourselves.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
How do you get people
to-- I remember actually

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:84%
the-- the story of Lynne
Twist shows up in my mind,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because she used to
be able to collect--

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:53.910 align:middle line:84%
or still probably-- huge amounts
of money to support others.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.650 align:middle line:84%
What is-- is there a
trick to that or something

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that you have learned or you
want to share when you want

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to raise money, whether it's
for ourselves or a project

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.091 align:middle line:84%
or for others?
-Yes.

00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I think--
-And enroll people into--

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think it's--
it's all about being

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:84%
inspirational and being true and
authentic and from your heart.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something you
really feel very passionate

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:84%
about, and you feel
that you really

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.620 align:middle line:84%
know that you can make a
difference doing that, I think

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:90%
that's what inspires people.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:84%
People-- you can't get
away from authenticity.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
If that's what they see,
they'll see it in your eyes.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
They'll just feel it as
it comes from your heart

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.160 align:middle line:90%
as you're saying the words.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But I-- I-- again, I'm not
a fund raiser particularly.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But I just speak from my
heart about situations

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and about places.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And that just attracts
people like a magnet.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, you attracted
the two helicopters.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's very
costly and expensive.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:84%
That's-- maybe
it's not in money,

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's a big contribution.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- it's the same.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You have to enroll
people into it

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and to giving those resources.
-Yes, it is.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, have--
have a really--

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.750 align:middle line:90%
have a-- have a higher purpose.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Have a-- have a reason
why you know it's really

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:90%
going to make and do good.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually
people's hearts melt.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.040 align:middle line:84%
They can see that
you-- your agenda

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.310 align:middle line:90%
is to do good for others.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And the doors open.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there a last story
or word or something

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that you would like
to share with us

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that feels important
to say right

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.130 align:middle line:90%
now within this conversation?

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.550 align:middle line:90%
I just-- so many stories.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But really do encourage
from the youngest person

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that you know to
really-- to give them

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:90%
a heart opening experience.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I've got a grandson
who is four years old.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's just so lovely
when he-- when I--

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:90%
when we do something together.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And we see maybe a little old
lady sitting on a park bench

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:90%
on her own looking a bit sad.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll go and sit next
to her and have a chat

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and just spend some
time with someone

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:84%
who you think is looking
a bit lonely or a bit sad.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And start this process
with-- with the children

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:90%
or with the young adults.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
As young as you
can, just instill

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that-- that attitude
of gratitude,

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:84%
that service
feeling within them.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it actually
makes their life so rich.

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And once it's started-- I
mean, why do you think I

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.610 align:middle line:90%
will never retire until I die?

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Because what I do is addictive.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.830 align:middle line:84%
When you help people, you are--
you are rich beyond words,

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.220 align:middle line:84%
beyond belief,
beyond bank balance.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we should instill

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.620 align:middle line:84%
into the youngest of our
friends and our children

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and our grandchildren.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.122 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
live a magical life.

00:43:42.122 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, beautiful.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
this juicy conversation.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.520 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.930 align:middle line:90%
Inspiring, inspiring.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Linda.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You're the author of
"Marmalade and Machine Guns."

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
this conversation.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.550 align:middle line:90%
We're here in Windsor in the UK.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:90%
And we send you much love.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:43:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.434 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.
