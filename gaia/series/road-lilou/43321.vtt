00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Hello, my
juicy co-creators.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.576 align:middle line:84%
I'm in London in
England with Davina.

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> DAVINA MACKAIL: Hello, Lilou.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
It's just delightful
to be here with you.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.726 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I know, and
we're going to have such

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.735 align:middle line:84%
a-- I'm as excited as you
are, because I love speaking

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual,
enlightening, divine topics,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.855 align:middle line:90%
shamanistic topics.

00:00:34.855 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
all about that.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the
Hay House authors.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:90%
You wrote "The Dream Whisperer."

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Where did that title come from?

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.747 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Well, because who
whispers your dreams to you?

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.122 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's
a good question.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what my whole book's
about, that question.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it was like, who
whispers those dreams?

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:90%
They're such profound messages.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And for me, dreams have
so many different layers.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.884 align:middle line:84%
A dream can be
obvious in the moment

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and you think, oh,
yeah, I see how

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that relates to my day or my
life or what's going on for me.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the same dream can have
a prophetic quality many years

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:84%
later where you
think, oh my god,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:84%
that's that dream
from years ago.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm living it in this moment.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.115 align:middle line:90%
So they're very mysterious.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And you think, who
whispers our dreams to us?

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.683 align:middle line:84%
So really that's where
the title came from.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Because I know
you have not just a little

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
but a big shamanic approach
to your work, I feel, no?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.389 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So I guess we're going
to speak of the spirit world

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: We are certainly
going to speak of the spirit

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.759 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
For me, I am a shaman.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.320 align:middle line:84%
That's my whole way
of living and being.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism found me
and continues to find me.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a tough road
to walk sometimes,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think I would
have voluntarily chosen it

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
if I had ended up in some of
the experiences I've ended up

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
However, I wouldn't
change anything either.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But spirit keeps
bringing it towards me,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's like you are going
to walk this path, girl,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.349 align:middle line:90%
whether you like it or not.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps turning up,
and it keeps turning up,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.014 align:middle line:84%
however much I say, OK, I've had
enough now, I want to go home,

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to go, it just
keeps showing up.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.769 align:middle line:84%
I first met a shaman in the
mid '90s when I was actually

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
doing a feng shui training
in Reading in England,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:90%
of all places.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And we flew in teachers
from all around the world,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
because there was two
feng shui books when

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.329 align:middle line:84%
I learned-- now there are
bookshelves full of them--

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and we had to fly in
teachers all over the world,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
because there just
wasn't the people there

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.361 align:middle line:90%
with the knowledge.

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
guys was not really

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
anything to do with
feng shui, but he

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.495 align:middle line:84%
had some architectural
experience

00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%
and he knew about the landscape.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But he came in with
his shamanic ways,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle line:84%
and I just fell in
love with what he did.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We were actually in
Wayland's Smithy,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a burial
site in the UK.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And we were in this cave, and he
had a pipitu, which is a shell,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.974 align:middle line:84%
like a conch shell,
and that's all he had.

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:53.765 align:middle line:84%
And there were just
six of us in this cave,

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:58.285 align:middle line:84%
and my experience in that
evening was extraordinary.

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:01.175 align:middle line:84%
I could hear a choir of
angels, this beautiful music.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:02.925 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to open
my eyes at one point.

00:03:02.925 --> 00:03:03.924 align:middle line:90%
We were just meditating.

00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:05.391 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
god, how has he got

00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:90%
all those instruments playing?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Has he put a tape machine
on while we weren't looking?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Has he got a secret microphone
in his pocket or something?

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we came out,
everyone said, oh my god,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:90%
did you hear that music?

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.321 align:middle line:84%
There was a host of angels
in that little cave with us.

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And all he had was the shell.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And what he created in
terms of the spirit--

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and I just thought, I want
to know how he does that.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to know.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I trained
him for the next,

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.740 align:middle line:84%
well, seven years in
total, sometimes in the UK,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in America,
sometimes in Ireland,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in different
parts of, as I say, America.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
But from there I continued my
training with the Q'ero Indians

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in Peru itself really
high up in the Andes,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
really up in that bright
light consciousness

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.300 align:middle line:90%
of the mountains and the Apus.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
They call them
Apus, and they are

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
the teachers, the mountains,
in that tradition.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful tradition,
really beautiful tradition.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Tell us about the
shadow aspect or the darker

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.800 align:middle line:84%
side, if we can say, or the
scary part that you can face

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
when you're starting to be in
a shamanic journey or that you

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
might have faced yourself
and deal with, I guess,

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.732 align:middle line:84%
to bring more light into
your life and to us.

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.733 align:middle line:84%
For me, there is only
one way to the light,

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:90%
and that's through the dark.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the yin and yang.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Within the extreme of one
is always its opposite.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think my early
spiritual journey

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
through feng shui and the whole
New Age movement was very much,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
oh, light a candle, call in
the angels, it's all light

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then what happens
is, because nobody knew really

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with the
shadow or we're not

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
addressing the
shadow, what occurred

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.176 align:middle line:84%
in my experience of really being
on this path in the early '90s

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
was everyone was
bitching at everybody.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, hang on, this
is meant to be feng shui.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
It's all about balance, love,
and harmony in the home,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's at each other's
throats in competition.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Where's that coming from?

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism, for me, was
such a relief to come home to.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It was such an eye-opener,
because shamanism

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
is all about the shadow.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It's all about, really,
as Jung would say,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:90%
the individuation of the self.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It's dealing with that
unconscious elements,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
the disowned aspects of self
that when we deal with that,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:90%
that's how we become whole.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think people get the
wrong idea about the shadow.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Is like, oh, I can't admit
that I'm a bad person

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
or that I've got these awful
angry, jealous thoughts going

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:90%
through my head.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:90%
But we have free choice.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a moral
compass that can allow

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
us to know whether we act
out on those bad thoughts,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's our choice.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But we just have to own
that we have the potential.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's really
what brings us into wholeness.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.735 align:middle line:84%
And really, if we look at
our world in terms of light

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and dark or the
shadow and the light,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.442 align:middle line:84%
however you want
to interpret it,

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.775 align:middle line:84%
there is just one basic
argument that causes separation,

00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's I'm right,
you're wrong.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Every argument comes
down to that core tenant.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, shamanism
is saying, well, I'm right,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're right or I'm
wrong, and you're wrong.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Rather than this or
that, it's this and that.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's being able to
hold the paradox of that

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
which allows us to transcend.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So there are many dark
nights of the soul

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
I've spent on my
shamanic journey.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
I have literally had at least
three near-death experiences,

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean physical
near-death experiences,

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
two from very high altitude,
one from just getting very, very

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:90%
sick.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they are
part of that journey.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.205 align:middle line:84%
But funnily enough, they
possibly weren't the worst.

00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is just the
uncovering of our layers

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of conditioning and
habituated selves.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe it's
worth explaining to viewers

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
where the shadow comes from.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.624 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's
mothers out there,

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:39.790 align:middle line:90%
you've all experienced this.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
You see your child,
and the child

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
is happy, sad, angry,
guilty, shameful,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
all in space of
about three seconds.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.958 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really have
anything between its emotions.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It can have all of
them in the same hour.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get to
two or three years old,

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:90%
we start to condition the child.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't do that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Take your elbows off.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.176 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, you
mustn't have that.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
No, that's dangerous.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.764 align:middle line:84%
And the child at
two or three doesn't

00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
understand what's happening.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:84%
All it knows is that,
in the ideal family,

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.047 align:middle line:90%
it had this incredible love.

00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look, I can do no wrong.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:90%
My parents love me.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything I do is
accepted and loved.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly it wasn't or
isn't, and they don't know why.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.199 align:middle line:84%
All the child experiences
is loss of love.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I don't
know what I've done wrong,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
but I can feel that isn't
a good thing anymore.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And so a child very
quickly learns--

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and every culture
has the same, but we

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.340 align:middle line:84%
have different rules
for it, if you like.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And we all get rewarded
for our good behavior

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:90%
and punished for our bad.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So we very quickly
learn to show up

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
as our good,
smiley, happy selves

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and hide all the other
stuff in a bag behind us,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.468 align:middle line:84%
tie an knot in it and
pretend it doesn't exist.

00:07:43.468 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
And there is your shadow.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And as we grow older,
the things that kind of

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:84%
push our buttons
in life, the things

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:84%
that aggravate us
often reflected

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
in our nearest and dearest,
our most intimate partners,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our
family, they're always

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
going to be the ones
that push the buttons,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
because they are your
unacknowledged shadow showing

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.715 align:middle line:84%
up to go, hello, I'm
still part of you,

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
you just have to own me,
and then I'll disappear.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not about resisting it.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
having to act it out.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's acknowledging
the potential.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We are both the murderer
and the murdered,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the rapist and the raped,
the abuser and the abused.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
act it out, but we

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.435 align:middle line:84%
have to acknowledge
the potential

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have within us.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: But on a spirit
level, from my understanding,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
there's pieces
maybe of the soul.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Like in the shamanic
journey, there

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
seems to be some kind of rituals
to bring those pieces back

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
together that were kind
of lost and maybe so hurt

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
that part of us decided
to kind of leave this body

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
or not be really present
in those moments.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of people
that become numb in the society

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So is that something that you
also deal with on a soul level

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Because right now I'm hearing
that the childhood and as

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:90%
kids when we got hurt, you know?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.897 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: I think, yes.

00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:90%
I hear what you're saying.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.771 align:middle line:84%
I think they're slightly
different aspects.

00:09:02.771 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And the soul retrieval often
comes through trauma, actually.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So in Peruvian cosmology
that I've mostly trained in,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
if you have an accident
or you're shocked,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
you get a big fright,
that will cause soul loss.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So literally bits
of your soul can

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
get splintered out of the body.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, there are processes
to bring back to wholeness

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and call the soul
back home and to call

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.996 align:middle line:84%
those disparate parts
of the soul home.

00:09:25.996 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.015 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: So from
that perspective, yes.

00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
But in general, the
shamanism that you talk about

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
is to heal, then.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
healing aspect of--

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: It's a way of life.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there are
healing modalities.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So I do work as a
shamanic healer.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I personally believe
no one heals anyone.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
All my job is to--
I think, really,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:84%
the shaman's job
generally, the shaman

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't actually do anything.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
What the shaman does is
line up the dominoes.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
the dominoes lined up,

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.534 align:middle line:90%
the magic happens all on itself.

00:09:58.534 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
shaman's skilled at,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
shaman's trained in,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
in how to set the space,
how to get everything

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:84%
in perfect alignment so
that spirit can show up

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
in a truly magical way
and allow the healing

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate the true
healing that needs to occur.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.312 align:middle line:84%
It's not me, and
it's no other shaman.

00:10:16.312 --> 00:10:17.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not a human.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.019 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But we do have skills in
being able to set the space

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to create that facility.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So related to
living our highest potential

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and your book, "The
Dream Whisper,"

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is that kind of like in the
dream, then, the spirit?

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Or there's pieces-- What
happens during the dream?

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
How does this
message come through?

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: In many
different ways.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of
shamanic practices

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
within the book on how
to work with dreams.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in shamanic cultures
they discuss dreams.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, they have
meetings with the elders

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and the council
of the community,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.313 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, well what
did you dream last night?

00:10:58.313 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And they believe in
the communal dream.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.382 align:middle line:84%
They maybe actually
set dreams, like where

00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
are the best hunting
grounds going to be?

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Where are we going
to get our best food?

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Where is the best place
to plant the crops?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it time to put the
alpacas to bed yet?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it might be.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And they will use
dreams in that way.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I think in a more
modern Western context,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
for me our dreams are
an untapped resource

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:90%
of creativity.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I think dreams are
so powerful, and I

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
don't believe anything in
the human biology is wasted.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, why
do we have dreams?

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're
multifunctional.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.991 align:middle line:84%
I do think they
balance our psyches.

00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's a
really interesting thing.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
time of Freud, Freud

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
believed, in his
interpretation, that all dreams

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:90%
had a sexual kind of message.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
He related the most
extraordinary things to sex,

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
in terms of dream symbolism.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at the context
within which he operated,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
he operated in Victorian times,
the most repressed sexual age.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So probably the dreams he got
coming through his therapy room

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:90%
were mostly about sex.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Because your dream will
balance your psyche,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:84%
so it will be a
representation of what's

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:90%
not expressed in your living.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So dreams will be an expression
of what you're not living out,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
if it's out of
balance in your life.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, often women
that go on extreme diets

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.236 align:middle line:84%
will often start
dreaming about food

00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and stuffing their
faces in the dreams,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're denying
themselves in reality.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Our body, our biology,
and our psyche

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is always trying to come
into a homeostatic state,

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
a state of balance.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So dreams have that function.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But actually what happens to
the neurology in the brain

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:84%
when we're in dream sleep
is that all the logical,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
rational chemicals get
switched off, and all

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:84%
our most creative
chemicals get switched on.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.965 align:middle line:84%
So we literally are
solution-seeking missiles

00:12:43.965 --> 00:12:45.470 align:middle line:90%
when we're in dream sleep.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We are programmed to
be really creative.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's why, if you do the
research, most of our Nobel

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Prize winners, true creatives,
writers, poets, most of them,

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
if you investigate it,
have had inspiration

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
from the dream world.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Most Nobel prize winners
have either dreamt part

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of the solution to their
theorem or an experiment to try.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, for example, he dreamt
about the theory of relativity.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.305 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing is
it seems obvious,

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
but what he actually dreamt--
and he had this dream

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.804 align:middle line:84%
when he was 19
years old-- and he

00:13:17.804 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
dreamt that he was
on a toboggan and he

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
was coming down a ski slope
really, really fast, so fast

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
whizzing down until it
fractured into light, the speed

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:90%
that he was coming.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Now he woke up from
that dream at 19.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It took him some time to come up
with the theory of relativity.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But he knew there was something
significant in the dream,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and he just kept exploring
it within his psyche.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:90%
And he was a champion dreamer.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Einstein really understood
the power of sleep.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.405 align:middle line:84%
If he was really working
on a juicy project,

00:13:46.405 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
he'd make sure he
got 12 hours a night.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
When do we ever give
ourselves that these days?

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We're in a sleep
deprivation culture.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
We've lost the art of dreaming.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:84%
We don't even really acknowledge
that we need sleep anymore

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.502 align:middle line:84%
in this information
overload age.

00:13:59.502 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
really interesting.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But for me, what I'm
interested in in the book

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and what the book
is about is less

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to do with healing one's
psyche through the dreams

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
but more about how can we
utilize this resource at night

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:84%
in order to progress our lives,
to find our soul's journey,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to find our heart's truth?

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So a really great technique
that's really simple

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is give your dreams
some context.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, when
you go to sleep at night

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
you could just dream
about anything,

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and the dream that
comes up could

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
be to do with any
aspect of your life.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you program
your dream and go,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, I really would love a clear
dream that I remember on X,

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.000 align:middle line:84%
or what do I most
need to know about Y,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.295 align:middle line:84%
and then your dream
will have context,

00:14:46.295 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:84%
particularly if it's the
last thing you think about

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:90%
as you're going into sleep.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the information
that you get from the dream

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:90%
is much more useful.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
viewers will go, oh, but

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:90%
I never remember my dreams.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.395 align:middle line:90%
I don't dream.

00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:90%
And of course, everyone dreams.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
We just don't always
remember them.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple
of really good tricks.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.144 align:middle line:84%
The first one is dreams seem to
be located in time and space.

00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:10.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
that when you first wake up

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
in the morning you just
stay perfectly still.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't move.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.249 align:middle line:90%
Don't jump out of bed.

00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't go for a pee.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Don't go and do all
those normal things.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult if you're a mom
when the young kids are jumping

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
all over you, so maybe
not your dream time.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise, just
lie perfectly still,

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and you just ask yourself,
what was I last thinking?

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.370 align:middle line:90%
What was I last feeling?

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Where was I just now?

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be amazed
at the recall.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
A couple of weeks of
that-- you might only

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.670 align:middle line:84%
get a few snippets to begin
with, but in two weeks,

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone can train
themselves to be good dreamer

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and to remember.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's about intention.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We have something in the
brain called the reticular

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.389 align:middle line:90%
activating system.

00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Not a particularly
nifty little name,

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:90%
but it's quite a nifty device.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've had an
experience with this

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.247 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever bought a new
car in a particular color,

00:15:52.247 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
never really particularly
noticed it before,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly as soon
as you drive this car

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.268 align:middle line:84%
it seems like every
other car on the road

00:15:57.268 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:90%
is your car in your color.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Now they didn't make 500,000
more cars like that overnight.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
What it is is your
perceptual awareness

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't need that
information before,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but now it's taken it in, so
it includes it in your vision.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.305 align:middle line:90%
And the same with dreams.

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't pay
attention to dreams.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, I'm really
interested in dreams.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.952 align:middle line:84%
Even people listening
to this interview

00:16:17.952 --> 00:16:19.410 align:middle line:84%
have got a higher
percentage chance

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of having a dream
they'll remember

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:90%
when they've heard this.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Because just activating
that requirement

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or that desire for
dreaming in their mind

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:84%
activates the reticular
activating system,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and the unconscious
mind goes, oh, yeah,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
finally they're going to
listen to the dreams, great.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's give them some juicy ones.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:36.235 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.749 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: So it really
does wake that part of us up.

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But for me, dreams are an
untapped creative resource.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:90%
We have it in our language.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, I'll sleep
on it, and you sometimes

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.391 align:middle line:90%
wake up with the answer.

00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:49.889 align:middle line:84%
But we think it's
just because we've

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
rested and had a
good night's sleep.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.119 align:middle line:84%
It's because your
creative chemicals

00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
have been working on the problem
during the night when you've

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
let go of the rational
need to focus on your life

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and live in a conscious way.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.647 align:middle line:90%
So it's really powerful.

00:17:03.647 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So how do
we go on about it?

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
Because I had interviewed
Charlie Morley

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:10.981 align:middle line:84%
on lucid dreaming, so this is
a different conversation here

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
But how do we go about it if
we have this recollection?

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:84%
Do we hit it more
on the feelings

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
or on the details of the dream?

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.806 align:middle line:90%
Or do we start interpreting it?

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
so many different

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
currents about
looking at dreams.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: There are.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.154 align:middle line:84%
And for me, Charlie
Morley's lucid dreaming,

00:17:28.154 --> 00:17:30.204 align:middle line:84%
I don't focus so much
on that, because there

00:17:30.204 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
are other people that do it,
like him and Stephen LaBerge,

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is also excellent
on that subject.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I think it's
a really good practice.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.704 align:middle line:84%
But I think we can get
a lot out of our dreams.

00:17:39.704 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, in my experience
of working with people,

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.092 align:middle line:84%
I don't think everyone is
prone to lucid dreaming.

00:17:45.092 --> 00:17:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I think some people are more
prone to it than others,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in my experience.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But normal dreams can be worked
on a number of different ways.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest things
is write them down,

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
because one dream in isolation
isn't actually that useful.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Dreams when you've
got two years of them

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
or several months of them, then
it becomes really powerful.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.204 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
most powerful ways

00:18:07.204 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is to just keep
writing them down,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
not really pay too
much attention.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And then periodically, maybe
every couple of months,

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
read them, starting with
the most recent first.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.015 align:middle line:84%
Undisturbed, read
them backwards,

00:18:17.015 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the point
where you want, and then just

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
write down the common themes.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice
just how many --

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
even though the dreams all seem
different, all seem random,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
whatever, you'll suddenly notice
all these patterns and themes

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:90%
are continually showing up.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.264 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do is
learn our own dream language.

00:18:35.264 --> 00:18:36.805 align:middle line:84%
I think you're the
only personal that

00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:38.138 align:middle line:90%
can really interpret your dream.

00:18:38.138 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have a mind,
and I have a lot

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of metaphysical symbolic
awareness because

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.850 align:middle line:84%
of the things I've trained
in, so I can give people

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
real pointers and helpers of
where the area of their dream

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.966 align:middle line:90%
is likely to be.

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But really, you're
the one that's

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
going to get that, oh,
god, yeah, that's it.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.807 align:middle line:90%
That's what that dream meant.

00:18:55.807 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn our
own dream language, which

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.167 align:middle line:84%
we only do through practice,
through journaling,

00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
through writing it down,
through paying attention.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll maybe always
get a tree in your dream,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.742 align:middle line:84%
and I might always get
a tree in my dream.

00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a recurring theme.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But for you, it might be
to do with your family tree

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.325 align:middle line:84%
and, say, your grandfather
or something to do with him

00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:15.616 align:middle line:90%
and that's the way he shows up.

00:19:15.616 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, it might be a tree I
fell out of when I was a kid

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and broke my arm, so there's
still some trauma associated.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be
individual on that level.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.926 align:middle line:84%
Can we classify them
in different ways?

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: I used
to think that,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and my book kind of
says that in a way.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:84%
But since the few years
since I've written the book,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so sure anymore.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm really changing my
own views on dreams,

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:84%
the deeper I'm
working with them.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I really
spoke about earlier.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I think the same dream
can have a number

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of different levels
of interpretation.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be, as I say,
just the day-to-day psyche,

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:90%
the balancing.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.900 align:middle line:90%
You can see why it's showing up.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it can have a
prophetic quality later on,

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be
something maybe coming in

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.610 align:middle line:84%
from the-- I think the
quality of dreams--

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and again, one has to really
become in dialogue with one's

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:90%
own dream landscape.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I get what
I call medicine dreams,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:90%
shamanic medicine dreams.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be in ceremony.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely
not of this realm.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.135 align:middle line:84%
And I know them-- they
have a different quality.

00:20:22.135 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They have a
different experience.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.609 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
wow, this is coming

00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:90%
from some other shamanic realm.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
This is coming from a
spiritual realm, whatever.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:90%
They're not my day-to-day--

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Those
are the cool ones.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:90%
They are the cool ones, yeah.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I have great dreams.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
My favorite dream of all
time for myself was I

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.852 align:middle line:84%
was an intergalactic planetary
investigator-- it's great.

00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:43.560 align:middle line:90%
What a great job.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I so want that on
my business card--

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up on this
planet governed by love.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.001 align:middle line:84%
And there was this council
of elders in the forest,

00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and it was really weird.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how
is this planet governed?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh, by love.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
do you mean by that?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, try
and think of something.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.206 align:middle line:84%
And even in the dream--
this was like a really weird

00:21:01.206 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
lucid moment-- I tried
to think of an old issue

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
experiencing in my life,

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.954 align:middle line:84%
and it was like I
couldn't think of it

00:21:07.954 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
in the way I used to
think of it in the dream.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.817 align:middle line:84%
It was like I could only think
of it through the eyes of love.

00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That makes
a big difference.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:14.691 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It makes a huge difference.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.555 align:middle line:84%
And then it was a
tree of life dream,

00:21:17.555 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and there was this massive
world tree uprooted.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And it became a highway with
everything on that highway.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.521 align:middle line:84%
It looked empty
until we got on it.

00:21:25.521 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Because this woman invited
me, from the council,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:90%
she invited me home for tea.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:90%
And

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:84%
There was just divine light
at the end of the tree,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.744 align:middle line:84%
and we were on this highway, and
there was people on unicycles,

00:21:33.744 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and there was gnomes and
elves and fairies and pixies

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.785 align:middle line:90%
and magicians.

00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The whole world was on that
world tree going up and down.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:90%
It was very full of traffic.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
this extraordinary--

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were just literally
heading up towards the light

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:84%
through all the
levels of the worlds.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.202 align:middle line:90%
It was a fabulous dream.

00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: You wanted
to stay there.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.081 align:middle line:90%
I did want to stay there, yeah.

00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I remember dreaming
of the akashic records.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.626 align:middle line:90%
I was clearly in this thing.

00:21:58.626 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It was surreal, and it
lasted for a long time.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.232 align:middle line:90%
Is time the same in dream world?

00:22:03.232 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Well,
it's interesting.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:84%
According to scientific
research, yes,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:90%
you dream in real time.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little
bit like, though, I

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
think there is such a
thing as psychological time

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:90%
as well as chronos time.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's chronos, linear,
tick-tock, tick-tock, seconds

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:84%
passing, minutes
gathering, but then there

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.445 align:middle line:90%
is psychological time.

00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And you've always experienced
that in meditation.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you can be in
meditation for 10 minutes,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.016 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like 300 years.

00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And other times, you can be
in meditation for 10 minutes,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like 3 seconds.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's psychological time.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing something you
really love and absorbed in,

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:90%
time disappears.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.853 align:middle line:84%
If you waiting for a bus,
time takes a very long time,

00:22:40.853 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind
of dreaming, I

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
think, the time that
occurs in dreaming.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.546 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:22:47.546 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So once we start to
remember our dreams,

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
do we also write
the synchronicities

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that happened during the day?

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems like there is
a correlation too with what's

00:22:58.330 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So how can we make the
most out of all this?

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: For me, your
dreams are like your internal

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.659 align:middle line:90%
therapist.

00:23:05.659 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
go and pay for someone.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Just pay attention to your
dreams, and write them down.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.163 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
dialogue with yourself.

00:23:11.163 --> 00:23:12.747 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:23:12.747 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: For me, the most
useful thing with dreams is

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.164 align:middle line:90%
to ask a question.

00:23:16.164 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to
know about this?

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.455 align:middle line:84%
Because then you've got
context, and then you

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
can see the dream in relation
to the question you've asked,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and you will see much more
easily able to interpret it,

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
basically, because you'll
see the correlation.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You will get to know
your dream symbols,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.914 align:middle line:84%
because you will have certain
things that consistently show

00:23:33.914 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:84%
up in your dreams, even
in different contexts,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
like a particular
cat or, I don't know,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
a tree or house or something.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So you get to know
your dreamscape.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, for example, maybe
you have recurring dreams.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I always find recurring
dreams really interesting,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.685 align:middle line:84%
and these are really
useful to work with.

00:23:49.685 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend anyone that's
having a recurring dream

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%
looks at it.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Because we have perfect biology.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Why is it going to keep
playing the same dream out

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
like some old stuck record?

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And for me, really what we
have is the world of Me,

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Incorporated.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
We are, as a human being, we're
a well-functioning company,

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.412 align:middle line:90%
hopefully.

00:24:08.412 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious
mind, the bit you and I

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.828 align:middle line:84%
are having a conversation
with right now,

00:24:11.828 --> 00:24:13.730 align:middle line:90%
that's the boss of the company.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
It's in charge, it makes
all the decisions, but not

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:90%
terribly bright half the time.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And we've all worked, probably,
for companies like that.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But the unconscious
mind, the world

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.894 align:middle line:84%
of the dreams, the water,
the memories that we carry,

00:24:24.894 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the genetic cellular
memories-- and that

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.790 align:middle line:90%
also comes up in dreams.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.349 align:middle line:84%
They can be memory dreams,
too-- that has the wisdom,

00:24:31.349 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
but it's the servant
of the conscious mind.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:90%
It does not have free will.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's like our dreams
are our nighttime management

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Now mostly in a
company, the workforce

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.879 align:middle line:84%
just get on and run the
company, don't they?

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:90%
They just know their job.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:90%
They do their job.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But every now and again,
they've got to go to the boss

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
because they don't know
how to solve a problem.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:50.890 align:middle line:90%
They're going, you know what?

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.014 align:middle line:84%
This has come up, and I
don't know how to solve it.

00:24:53.014 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, is
a recurring dream.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like the recurring
dream is going,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:90%
we can't solve this for you.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:90%
We can't sort this out.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
You need to actually
pay conscious attention

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on here.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.624 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
repressed emotional issue

00:25:05.624 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be dealt with.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some
old trauma in there.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.807 align:middle line:84%
Post-Traumatic Stress
Syndrome is often

00:25:10.807 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
one that will cause those
recurring dreams, things

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:90%
of that nature.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But often there's an original
incident that preempted it.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
with a recurring dream,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:84%
there may be that
original issue.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And then when a similar
emotional problem occurs,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll get the same
dream, because it's

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.582 align:middle line:90%
a similar emotional resonance.

00:25:28.582 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, yeah, this is
similar to what you experienced

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
before, and you haven't
dealt with this yet.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
So those ones are really
worth paying attention.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's an art.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not a precise science.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.636 align:middle line:84%
It does require a level
of emotional intelligence

00:25:41.636 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look
at your stuff.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Most of us want to
hide from our stuff,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really want to
face those darker aspects,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really want
to admit that, oh, actually

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
there's stuff I've got
to deal with there.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.198 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a perfect
person after all.

00:25:51.198 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Damn.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
[SIGHS] Missed
that day at school

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
when they were giving
out the perfect cards.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So it does require a particular
quality of attitude of going,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
wow, I'm this great big messy,
fabulous, gorgeous individual,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to accept all of
my great big messy loveliness,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.845 align:middle line:84%
rather than needing
it all to be perfect.

00:26:11.845 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship with
shamanism, during the sleep

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I guess the soul also expresses.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:24.679 align:middle line:90%
Or is it only the subconscious?

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: It's a very
difficult question.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Who knows, really, is the
ultimate answer to that?

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
From a shamanic perspective,
most indigenous cultures

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
would look at the dreaming
world slightly different,

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and they would see it that we
go astral traveling, that we're

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.005 align:middle line:84%
visiting other realms and
dimensions during our dream

00:26:41.005 --> 00:26:43.650 align:middle line:84%
sleep, and that that
is the soul journeying

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
to go to other places.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:84%
For me, personally,
I think it's both.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware that some of my dreams
absolutely are astral travel

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
dreams, and that is my soul
journeying to other dimensions.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also aware
that on most levels

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:84%
my dreaming is just my
unconscious mind processing

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.090 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:90%
So I think both are true.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Now from a shamanic
cultural perspective,

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.755 align:middle line:84%
also they would
consider this world,

00:27:06.755 --> 00:27:08.880 align:middle line:84%
you and I sitting on this
sofa having an interview,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
as a dream, that
we're dreaming this.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Exactly.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:90%
Can we say life is a dream?

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.182 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah, that's right.

00:27:15.182 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Because really what we
take in through our eyes

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.199 align:middle line:90%
isn't true anyway.

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:19.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just data and electricity.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We make this up,
so this is a dream.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And from a shamanic
perspective, there

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
is something really
much more magical.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And that always reminds
me of that old story.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
This is one I'm sure you've
heard on this show before,

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
In one of the islands
of Hawaii when--

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: I love Hawaii.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hmm.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The owner of Gaiam,
I met him in Kawaii.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.309 align:middle line:84%
That's how this whole
journey-- I love Kawaii.

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Special, big kisses to all the
dolphins out there, oh my god.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:46.766 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Too right.

00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.446 align:middle line:84%
But when they were
being invaded in the

00:27:51.446 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Christopher-Columbus-type ages,
the medicine man of the village

00:27:54.070 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
-- the ship had parked
offshore or anchored offshore,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.639 align:middle line:84%
and nobody could see the ship
because they literally did not

00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:90%
have it in their consciousness.

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
They'd never seen a ship
before, because they

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what
one looked like.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was the shaman, he knew
something wasn't quite right.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.162 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he started to
watch the surface of the ocean,

00:28:16.162 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and he noticed that the wave
patterns were different.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what he understood.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.770 align:middle line:90%
He understood the ocean.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
He'd watched it every day of
his life, so he knew it well.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And through him observing
the different patterns,

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:90%
the ship became able to be seen.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he was able to
teach his community how

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to see the ship and said, look
at the ocean, and then the ship

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:90%
appeared.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.486 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting, this
seeing/believing, believing

00:28:40.486 --> 00:28:41.390 align:middle line:90%
is seeing.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
That did not exist, because
it wasn't in their mind,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and then it was.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And really, that's how it works.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
We can't really see it when
it's not in our conscious.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.246 align:middle line:90%
Our unconscious?

00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.020 align:middle line:90%
80% is back there?

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.809 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:28:55.809 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Well, apparently
our conscious mind can only hold

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.266 align:middle line:84%
about five or six bits
of information at once,

00:29:00.266 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:84%
so most of it is run
in the unconscious.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's like this
massive filing system

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that's just taking every
bit of millions of data

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:90%
in all the time.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:90%
But it's interesting.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in this world,
man made that is,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
exists other than lest
someone imagined it first.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So also this is
another great skill

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.561 align:middle line:90%
of the shaman is imagination.

00:29:19.561 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that's
why I became a shaman,

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.602 align:middle line:84%
because my mother when I was
a child was always saying,

00:29:23.602 --> 00:29:25.643 align:middle line:84%
the trouble with you,
girl, too much imagination.

00:29:25.643 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Now it's my greatest gift.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, thank god, I've
got a fantastic imagination.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It rocks.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank god for that.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.246 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to
see you as a shaman.

00:29:34.246 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when we see
you from the outside,

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:90%
we would never imagine that.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.001 align:middle line:90%
So there is quite a--

00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: The shamans
are always secret.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
They always walk
between the worlds.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Because a shaman's true nature
is to walk between the worlds.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:84%
So I need to be able
to just sit here

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.480 align:middle line:84%
having a perfectly
posh interview with you

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.880 align:middle line:84%
on a sofa with you in a
lovely flat in London, right?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.155 align:middle line:84%
Because if I turned up with my
condor feathers and my poncho

00:29:57.155 --> 00:29:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it,
you might be quite excited,

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.240 align:middle line:84%
but somebody else might
not let me in the door.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.749 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
One of my shamanic
teachers taught me this.

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.248 align:middle line:90%
It was brilliant.

00:30:06.248 --> 00:30:09.559 align:middle line:84%
We were up in the mountains
in Peru going to a pilgrimage

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:90%
to Salkantay.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It was tough.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We're out doing
medicine, we're working

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.434 align:middle line:84%
with the land, and
everything like that,

00:30:15.434 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asked
him a question.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.110 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, let's google it.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.396 align:middle line:90%
And it was just brilliant.

00:30:19.396 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I just fell about laughing.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There we are in the
middle of the mountains.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.522 align:middle line:90%
He's an indigenous shaman.

00:30:25.522 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I originally worked with his
grandfather, who's now passed,

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:90%
and he's the grandson.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But he was a proper
initiate, literally hit

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:84%
by lightning, nearly
died in a ditch,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
which is the absolute
true shamanic initiation

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:37.945 align:middle line:90%
of that tradition.

00:30:37.945 --> 00:30:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Really?

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: He's an enlightened
being, but he's young.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Literally.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah, literally
an enlightened being.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.940 align:middle line:90%
But he's so full of wisdom.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's only in his 30s,
a really remarkable person.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.795 align:middle line:90%
But he walks the worlds.

00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, Puma, you're
so good with the technology.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, you need to be.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.534 align:middle line:84%
He said, you need to
master it, Davina.

00:30:56.534 --> 00:30:59.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, that is a true
shaman, mastery of all words,

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.280 align:middle line:84%
so including the technosphere,
including this conscious living

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.066 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:31:04.066 --> 00:31:05.690 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
they talk about when

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.898 align:middle line:90%
they walk between the worlds.

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to find yourself
in any situation and adapt.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Part of finding our
highest potential is finding

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that spirit within us or
allowing it to really show us

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%
the way.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.680 align:middle line:84%
What is your view on really
living our highest potential,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:90%
since you're all about that?

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Get
out of our own way.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The biggest issue
in why none of us

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.029 align:middle line:84%
live or find it hard to
live our truest potential

00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:90%
is we get in our own way.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
We allow our habituated
conditioned minds

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:90%
to rule us with their dogma.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The conditioning is
so insidious that it's

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
really tough to
break through it.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Even this whole kind of
concept of Monday to Friday,

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.130 align:middle line:84%
weekends off, three
meals a day, that's

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:84%
come from the
Industrial Revolution.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.939 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you start questioning
most people on the street,

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:90%
they'll go, what do you mean?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.584 align:middle line:90%
I missed lunch.

00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die in a minute.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, actually, you're not.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not even healthy to
have three meals a day.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And just, oh, I need
eight hours of sleep.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Where's that come from?

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Even at that basic
level, we have

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.870 align:middle line:84%
unpick all that
conditioning in order

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to even begin to glimpse
our highest potential.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it takes enormous
courage to live your truth,

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
to be brave enough to
go against the grain,

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go against
perhaps what your family

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and friends would
wish for you and go,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.858 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm just going to
go and walk the road less

00:32:29.858 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
traveled, because this
is what my calling is.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's often a
very lonely path,

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because people mostly think
you're just mad or crazy

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:90%
or have lost the plot.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:39.340 align:middle line:84%
My mother's always
saying, when are

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:84%
you going to get a
proper job, love?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it time yet?

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, well, no, mom.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not, because
this is what I love.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And even for me,
I constantly have

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.367 align:middle line:84%
to check and take off the
layers, take off the layers,

00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:55.950 align:middle line:84%
take off the layers to allow the
authenticity to come through.

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the biggest thing
is to let go let go, let god,

00:32:58.650 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
the hardest thing.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.190 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be able to
spend time in solitude

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.570 align:middle line:84%
with yourself, because it is
the only way you will ever

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
get quiet enough to hear
the voice of your heart.

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:90%
You heart whispers.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It does not shout.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be really quiet
and really internal to hear

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:90%
the truth of what your heart is.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Your mind's the one that's
shouting all the damn time.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It makes such a flipping racket
in there, good old monkey mind,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.672 align:middle line:84%
like the chattering trees
in the forest, right?

00:33:25.672 --> 00:33:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Look at the difference.

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: That's when
you take ayahuasca.

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah, it is when
I take ayahuasca and all

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:31.530 align:middle line:90%
of those.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.155 align:middle line:84%
And I do work with
the plant medicines,

00:33:33.155 --> 00:33:34.905 align:middle line:84%
because they, for me,
are master teachers.

00:33:34.905 --> 00:33:35.821 align:middle line:90%
They're extraordinary.

00:33:35.821 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And we ultimately
come from the plants.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Without the plants, none of
us would be on this planet.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So they are true
teachers, and I've

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.460 align:middle line:84%
seen such miraculous
healings that I

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.000 align:middle line:84%
do believe they have
divine intelligence

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and they really work
through our DNA.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.414 align:middle line:84%
But just in terms of the
everyday, it is about --

00:33:55.414 --> 00:33:59.390 align:middle line:84%
ayni is one of the most powerful
concepts of the Peruvian

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:00.970 align:middle line:84%
cosmology from
the Q'ero Indians,

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
who are direct
descendants of the Inca.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.836 align:middle line:90%
And ayni is sacred exchange.

00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Ayni.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Ayni, A-Y-N-I, ayni.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
sacred reciprocity.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:90%
It's like nothing goes one way.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:18.082 align:middle line:84%
So smile at the world,
the world will smile back.

00:34:18.082 --> 00:34:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: There seems to
be, as you said earlier,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:90%
we're born into something.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:90%
There's a certain conditioning.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.340 align:middle line:90%
But there is chatter.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
There's this chatting.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.080 align:middle line:84%
There's this kind of noise
or this way of thinking

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:90%
that is not even ours sometimes.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:84%
We're just like, where did
that thought come from?

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the things,
I guess, holding us back too?

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.170 align:middle line:84%
How can we deal with
that part of the--

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.679 align:middle line:84%
If we dream about that, or if
we make choices in our life

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.090 align:middle line:84%
with that type of
it's not even ours,

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:90%
how do we even deal with that?

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.689 align:middle line:90%
We just cut the cords?

00:34:49.689 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Well,
give me an example.

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not clear on what
you're asking me.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: I don't have
any precise example.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Not hearing some voice, but
like when you're depressed

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
or when you're insecure
about something,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:84%
it may be the insecurity
of somebody else.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.990 align:middle line:84%
As we're becoming more
sensitive, more open, more

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:84%
transparent, and
hopefully more authentic,

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:90%
we feel things more and more.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like it could have
a disconnect too with is it

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:90%
mine?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Am I intuitively feeling that?

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the
work that I need to do?

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think more and more of
us feel this way-- is it mine?

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Is it others?-- so that we
can live more fully even more

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.851 align:middle line:84%
and just being present
instead of being in our minds.

00:35:39.851 --> 00:35:42.225 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: I think there is
no such thing as separation.

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.306 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: So you are another
me, and I am another you.

00:35:45.306 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: So from
that perspective,

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:90%
what's mine and what's yours?

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.091 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:35:49.091 --> 00:35:49.836 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:53.160 align:middle line:90%
So big cities like London...

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah,
but that is it.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the more open
and free-flowing we are,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:90%
the easier our flow is.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.762 align:middle line:84%
It's still back to that concept
let go, let god, let spirit,

00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Because think about the ocean.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:90%
The ocean is free-flowing.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.177 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:10.177 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The fish and the
things and everything

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.759 align:middle line:90%
flows through the ocean.

00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:14.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the water in our bodies.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.720 align:middle line:90%
We are free-flowing creatures.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.200 align:middle line:90%
We're full of liquid.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet in the ocean
it's the steel ship,

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:84%
the man-made object,
the conditioning,

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
if you like, the
habituated mind that

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:84%
collects the gnarly old
barnacles on its bottom.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Now the barnacles can
only hold onto the ship

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:32.870 align:middle line:90%
because it's steel.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It's solid.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we get experiences
in life that are less than

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:84%
or we perceive them to be less
than, we get hurt by them,

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
boyfriend leaves us,
girlfriend leaves us,

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
we have a breakdown
of some sort,

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:84%
we have some perceived
hurt, we tend

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to put a little bit of
steel around our heart.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:84%
We cage our heart, and
then the barnacles stick.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So what you're talking
about in terms of picking up

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:84%
other people's toxic energy,
we can only pick it up

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
if we're already closed,
because then it sticks.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.295 align:middle line:84%
Bad energy sticks
to bad energy--

00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.125 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: --like barnacles
on the bottom of a ship.

00:37:10.538 --> 00:37:13.965 align:middle line:84%
If your heart is fully open,
there's nothing to-- Well,

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.190 align:middle line:90%
it just flows through.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:16.023 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Beautiful.

00:37:16.023 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: And because emotions
are simply energy in motion,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.060 align:middle line:84%
we are not never going to
experience a bad emotion.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.484 align:middle line:84%
Of course we're
going to feel all

00:37:23.484 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of those emotions
all of the time.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.027 align:middle line:84%
We want to be back like
children, angry, sad, happy,

00:37:28.027 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and joyful all in three seconds.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.796 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.796 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens
with humans, we

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.070 align:middle line:84%
tend to want to hold
onto our bad emotions

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.040 align:middle line:90%
for some crazy reason.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So we lock them
down, or we don't

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:84%
feel safe to express them
and go, god, I'm pissed off,

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.841 align:middle line:84%
or I'm angry in this
moment, or whatever.

00:37:44.841 --> 00:37:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm raging.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
done, breathed out.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK, got that.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Moving on swiftly.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.097 align:middle line:84%
And it's just allowing
the flow of emotions.

00:37:53.097 --> 00:37:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't put them in
the pressure cooker.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't stick a lid on them.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't let them stick to us.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
hardest thing, because we

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.230 align:middle line:90%
are we taught about heartbreak.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We are taught, oh my god, that
poor person, all the pain,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:90%
all the loss, all this.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like we have to
wear it like a badge of honor.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It's bullshit, frankly.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, but it is.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.594 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, let it go.

00:38:13.594 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Keep letting go.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.296 align:middle line:84%
There's a brilliant,
brilliant exercise.

00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can
do an exercise on this.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Oh, yeah.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Bring it on.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Yeah.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:90%
This is really simple.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And especially with the
holiday season coming up,

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:90%
it's good for helping.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And the sacral chakra, which
is two fingers below your belly

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:84%
button-- it's called hucha
dumping in Peruvian cosmology,

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.900 align:middle line:84%
but really it's much
more sacred than that.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a great title for it.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Hucha is the Quechua
word for heavy energy.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:43.562 align:middle line:84%
And they don't think of things
as negative and positive.

00:38:43.562 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:84%
They see it literally
as light and heavy.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.576 align:middle line:84%
It has a different density,
a different quality.

00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: So you open your
spiritual stomach two fingers

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.460 align:middle line:84%
below your belly button, and you
allow like a Hoover tube to go

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:84%
out from your stomach deep
into the Earth below us.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have to go down
a few feet from this flat.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And we really put that
Hoover tube into the Earth.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And literally like a
Hoover, like a vacuum,

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the Earth with its
gravitational magnetic force

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.840 align:middle line:84%
is just going to
very gently suck

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
all the anxiety, the doubt,
the worry, the heaviness just

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:16.100 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:90%
This is ayni.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:middle line:90%
This is a sacred act of love.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.415 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing
is you're feeding

00:39:20.415 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:84%
the Earth with your love,
with your heavy energy.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.699 align:middle line:84%
Because, like we get
manna from heaven--

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
we tend to look up to
the angels, don't we?

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.531 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking for help,
we do tend to look up.

00:39:29.531 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't go, oh,
help me, help me.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:90%
We go, help me, help me.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So we know somehow intuitively
that the lighter energies

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.050 align:middle line:84%
are from the solar deities, from
the heavens, forces, whatever.

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:90%
So we pull that in.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth gets
lights from us.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth can
mulch that hucha,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth can extract
light from the hucha.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So our heavy energy is
like light to the mother.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, oh, give
all that heaviness

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.239 align:middle line:84%
to the mother with love,
really send it with love

00:39:58.239 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:84%
down that tube, and
let her suck out.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Because she's just like,
oh, feed me the light.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Feed me your love.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you
open the crown of your head,

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.310 align:middle line:84%
like the lotus flower opening
with its 1,000 petals,

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.542 align:middle line:84%
and you let that
higher light energy in.

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever want
to empty yourself out

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
without filling
yourself back up.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:19.837 align:middle line:84%
So you inhale that beautiful
high light vibration and exhale

00:40:19.837 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
through your sacral tube
into the Earth with love,

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
just letting go of all the
doubt, the anxiety, the worry,

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:90%
the junk you've held onto.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I do it on the Tube, in the car,
up 10,000 feet in an airplane.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Any time I'm feeling
a bit ugh, ugh, ugh,

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:90%
just let go of the hucha.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.596 align:middle line:84%
And when you're done, bring
your crown back to a bud,

00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:84%
bring the Hoover tube
back up, and just close

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.730 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual
stomach so that you've

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.630 align:middle line:90%
sealed your entry points.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.930 align:middle line:84%
But great simple
little exercise.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It's good practice of
ayni, and it really

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:90%
keeps your energy system clear.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Guilt-free too,
because the Earth loves it.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: The
Earth does love it.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Nice one.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love it.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So what we don't
deal with right now,

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.680 align:middle line:84%
in the nighttime it just
comes back in our dream,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.790 align:middle line:84%
basically, if we don't deal
with it in the daytime?

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: That
often happens, yeah.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.070 align:middle line:90%
But only if it it's an issue.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
If it's something
that is resonating

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.792 align:middle line:84%
with your particular psychology,
your particular emotional pain

00:41:18.792 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:84%
body, for example,
then, yeah, it's

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
going to show up in your dream
if something triggered that.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can just have
what Freud would term day

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.539 align:middle line:84%
residue dreams where
we've just been too busy,

00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:32.580 align:middle line:84%
just running, running,
running, running, running.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And then our dreams
are just processing

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
what we haven't had
time to process.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.139 align:middle line:84%
So you will get
weird sensations.

00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You've been to the shop, but
it will suddenly be purple

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.888 align:middle line:84%
or there'll be an
elephant in there

00:41:41.888 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:84%
or just random,
those crazy dreams.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at them, you're

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:47.436 align:middle line:84%
thinking, oh, that is what
I actually did yesterday,

00:41:47.436 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:84%
just in a bit of
dream craziness.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes you just
think, oh, no, that's

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:90%
just processing my day.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to look at that.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It is intuitive.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It is something that only
really through working with them

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that you get into the depth
of understanding them.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
comes with experience,

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.677 align:middle line:84%
and you get a feel
for, oh, yeah,

00:42:05.677 --> 00:42:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that's that kind of dream.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.575 align:middle line:90%
That's that dream.

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:09.075 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I do want to
look at that one.

00:42:09.075 --> 00:42:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I know there's
significance in that.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: So "Dream Whisperer,"
that's is an interesting title.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.545 align:middle line:84%
Because at the same time, I
guess, we whisper our dream,

00:42:16.545 --> 00:42:18.670 align:middle line:90%
but we receive also the dream.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.337 align:middle line:90%
It's like being both.

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Exactly.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.767 align:middle line:90%
That's why it is that title.

00:42:22.767 --> 00:42:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Beautiful.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there a last
thing that you would

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:29.350 align:middle line:84%
like to leave us with or
some aspect of the book

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:84%
or of your message that we
didn't cover or talk about that

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is essential to understand
this whole world

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
sharing with us today?

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: Just love
yourselves more, really.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I just think all
of us need to be

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.607 align:middle line:84%
kinder and more
loving to ourselves.

00:42:48.607 --> 00:42:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like when you look
in the mirror and see a frown,

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.432 align:middle line:84%
there is only one way
to change that frown,

00:42:53.432 --> 00:42:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's smile at yourself.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.265 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Yeah.

00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> MACKAIL: And when
you smile at yourself,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:90%
the world smiles back.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.905 align:middle line:84%
We get so stuck in
our pain body of I'm

00:43:00.905 --> 00:43:02.120 align:middle line:90%
not going to let anyone in.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to close myself off.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.202 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hurt victim.

00:43:04.202 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:90%
I've been abused.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.375 align:middle line:84%
I've had bad things
happen to me.

00:43:07.375 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Shit happens.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:10.720 align:middle line:90%
Be open.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Just keep opening, keep
opening, keep opening.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.957 align:middle line:84%
That is the only way
to set yourself free.

00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:16.790 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Beautiful.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Davina.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: Pleasure.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.028 align:middle line:84%
It's been a real
pleasure to talk to you.

00:43:20.028 --> 00:43:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> LILOU: Big, big kisses to
all juicy co-creators watching

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the dream whisperer.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel you are one too.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:90%
We're all, right?

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.190 align:middle line:90%
We're all?

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> MACKAIL: We are.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.920 align:middle line:84%
We are all dream
whisperers, indeed.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> LILOU: Ooh la la.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Big, big kisses to
all of you guys.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.530 align:middle line:84%
If you want to comment or
talk about your dreams,

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.660 align:middle line:84%
even, put your
dreams underneath.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:84%
This is nice to be
actively sharing all this.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And big, big kisses
to all of you.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Much love from beautiful London.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:57.667 align:middle line:90%
