00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Hello, my beautiful
co-creators.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Lilou here for Gaiam TV.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Holland today,
in Doorn, with John.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Great, Lilou.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here with you.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for accepting
to do this interview.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really
thrilled you're here

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:90%
at a conference on non-duality.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.475 align:middle line:84%
And you have an
impressive resume.

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
I love interviewing
people like you.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not the resume, but
it's just your achievements

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and your willingness to expose
with science together, hand

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.120 align:middle line:84%
in hand, how awesome
beings we are.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.811 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much for all
your work throughout the world.

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:84%
It's my pleasure.
Thank you.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Great to be with you today.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're a quantum
physician, particle physician?

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
Yes, or today we say
"unified field theorist,"

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:10%
or "superstring theorist,"
which is that branch of physics,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:10%
cutting edge physics, that
explores the deepest truth

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:10%
and the fundamental
unity of life,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:10%
the deep unity that
underlies and gives

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:10%
rise to the surface of
diversity of the universe,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:10%
the core unity in
you, at the core of me

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
and of everyone and everything.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:10%
That's the unified field.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:10%
You studied very-- you
had very academical studies

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:10%
when you went through Harvard.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And you were a researcher
at the CERN, right?

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Correct, yes, and Stanford
University faculty.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, the focus as
a superstring theory

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:84%
was not just on elementary
particle physics, which

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is part of it, but
it's going deep into it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to discover that all
the forces of nature,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
all the particles of nature,
are one at their source,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
discovering one universal
field of intelligence

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
at the basis of you and
me and the whole universe.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's quite
special, I feel,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
because really
earlier on you were

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
interested about the
transcendental meditation

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and what the Vedics are teaching
and what the Vedics were

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
teaching years ago, and
what you have come across

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and the theories and the
research that you have done

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
brings it all
together, doesn't it?

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
That is what is so
exciting about our time.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And that is after some decades
of vague correspondence

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
between modern science and the
ancient wisdom, from the Vedas,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.900 align:middle line:84%
for example, that correspondence
is no longer vague.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
That unity of modern science and
ancient wisdom is now complete.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Science has matured
to the point where

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
it has transcended diversity and
discovered the non-dual source.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
This is really fulfilling
Einstein's lifelong dream,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
which was to discover
the unified source

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
of the diversified
universe, fundamental unity

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
at the basis of the surface
diversity of the universe.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And once modern science
stepped onto unity--

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
and that is the thrust
of science today;

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
it's all about the
unified field--

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:84%
then we have, in a
sense, been able to shake

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
hands with the
ancient Vedic wisdom,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
the ancient major truth
traditions of the world

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
traditions of the world

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to jointly confirm the
fundamental unity of life.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that truly happening?

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Because from my understanding
and some interviews that I have

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
done, I do not really
see current science,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
the materialistic science,
coming to any sort

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:90%
of agreement whatsoever.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:84%
They seem more
rebellious than ever.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
science is a huge field.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's physics, and there's
biology, and there's botany,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and there's chemistry
and astronomy.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But the most advanced
in fundamental

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of those disciplines is
physics, and the most advanced,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
cutting edge area of
physics is superstring

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:90%
theory and M theory.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And there, among the
leaders in that world

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
of the string theorists and
unified field theorists,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
there is consensus.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not that unified field
theory or superstring theory

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.130 align:middle line:84%
won't continue to evolve
a bit and refine a bit

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%
and mature a bit.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But even now, the cornerstones
of the theory are in place,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamental unity of
life has been established.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
choice in physics.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Tell more about this bridge
of where we're at with science,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.490 align:middle line:84%
because most of us are used
to and have been taught

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:90%
at school regular science.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what is the evolution.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
How can we move from regular
science to this unified theory.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting question,
because really for quite

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.080 align:middle line:84%
a long time, classical
physics has given

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
rise to quantum mechanics.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And quantum mechanics
has been well

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:90%
established now for 90 years.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And it makes spectacularly
accurate predictions.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And we use it to create
transistors and computers

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and so many technologies.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet if you ask the
person in the street, even

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
the average scientist
or medical doctor,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
they don't know quantum
mechanics at all.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And it takes time for these
deep discoveries to percolate,

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
to trickle through
society, even to make

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:90%
their way into education.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So the people who are teaching
science in the schools today

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
are still teaching
classical science 90 years

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
after classical
science has changed,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:90%
given way to quantum mechanics.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And now quantum mechanics
in the last 25 years

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
has given way, after Nobel
Prize after Nobel Prize,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:90%
to the discovery of unity.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It was 1970s that a
Nobel Prize was given

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
for discovering that two of
the four forces of nature

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:90%
were actually one.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that principle of
unification is established.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But has it reached the
whole scientific community?

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:10%
Has it reached the
entire society?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But we don't worry too much
about the whole society,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
opinions are opinions.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You really want to know what's
going on at the forefront

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of science, and the
forefront of science

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:90%
is about the unified field.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Tell us more about
the unified field.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
This unified field,
or superstring field,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is a field of universal
intelligence, a field

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:90%
of abstract, pure existence.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And this ocean of pure existence
rises in waves of vibration.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And the waves of vibration
of the unified field

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
appear as the different
particles of nature,

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:90%
the different forces of nature.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.380 align:middle line:84%
The so-called building
blocks of creation

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
are just the vibrational
tones or weeks of this ocean

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:90%
of pure existence.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And of course, once
you create those waves,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:84%
so-called particles,
you can assemble them

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
into protons and
atoms and molecules

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and objects and people
and planets and galaxies.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:90%
So it all starts from the field.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lively,
it's a dynamic silence.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:10%
It's a dynamic field.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And then dynamism
of the field is

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
responsible for the field
flowing as vibration, vibrating

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
as frequencies or sound.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And the different sounds
of the unified field

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
are the elementary
particles and forces.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're not living in
a material universe.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:90%
This is for sure.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:84%
We are living,
really, in a symphony.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:84%
All these different
tones or frequencies

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:84%
of this universal
field, or unified field,

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
comprise the universe.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So you were made of
the unified field.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
You are the unified
field in vibration.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I am the superstring
field in vibration.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And planets and particles
and molecules-- everything

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is just that one ocean
of pure existence,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:90%
pure intelligence in vibration.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is the unity at the
basis of the surface diversity

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:90%
that is you and that is me.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And from this perspective,
and we'll talk about it,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
meditation,
classically understood,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:84%
classically practiced,
is a technique

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
to take our outwardly directed
attention, through the senses,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
powerfully within, to explore,
to experience deeper levels

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
of mind, quieter
levels of intelligence,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
quieter levels of thought,
and then slip beyond thought

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
completely to experience
what is called

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:90%
pure being, pure consciousness.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that maximally expanded
state of consciousness, also

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
called samadhi,
individual mind expands

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to become universal mind.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
That means individual
awareness directly experiences

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
the unified field, which
is the origin of thought

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:90%
and the origin of matter.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's what meditation
is, although meditation

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
today can mean a million
different things.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I really mean transcending,
transcending meditation leading

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
to samadhi, pure
consciousness, the experience

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
of the unified field.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
abstract theory.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
formulas on a paper.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Unified field is absolutely
central to you, central to me.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It is the core of life itself.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It is our own self,
our own subjectivity.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It is the knower within
us, the seer within us.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, that knower,
that seer, that consciousness

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
inside us is universal.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we know that
consciousness clearly

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and experience it frequently
so that you know it intimately,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
you know the self as unbounded,
universal, eternal, immortal,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:90%
bliss.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Is this what you call
the Maharishi effect?

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
The Maharishi Effect, which is
a concept that was discovered--

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
it was proposed and then
scientifically discovered

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
by Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, who revived yoga

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and revived, really,
transcendental meditation,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or transcending meditation,
in India and then here

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:90%
in the West, 50, 60 years ago.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The Maharishi Effect
is slightly different.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Maharishi Effect is
the calming effect,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.970 align:middle line:84%
or peace-promoting effect,
of meditation in groups.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's another interesting
area we can talk about.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
use group meditation

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to reduce social stress
and to calm social violence

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and to promote peace.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So when enough people
get together and they--

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:90%
How much is enough?

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the size of
the population you're hoping

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.810 align:middle line:84%
to calm down, but
typically the square root

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of 1% of a population,
which for the United States,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
my home country, would be
about 2,000 people in a group.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
For the whole world, if you
could create such a big group,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
it would be about 9,000.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're working on that today.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.410 align:middle line:90%
We are establishing a group.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We have a group in the United
States now of almost 2,000.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:10%
We're creating one super group
for the world in India, where

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.122 align:middle line:10%
it's very
cost-effective to do it,

00:11:41.122 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:10%
of about 9,000 advanced
meditating experts

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:10%
who, in a group,
according to research--

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:10%
and there's lots and lots of
very good published research--

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:10%
would produce a
harmonizing effect,

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:10%
a peace-promoting
effect big enough

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:10%
to improve trends and reduce
violence throughout the world.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's called
the Maharishi Effect.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.570 align:middle line:90%
How do you measure all of this?

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us some of the--
maybe not the equations,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
because I do not think
our mind can match

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
with your brilliant mind in that
way, but can you explain to us?

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, of course, one of the
new trends in meditation--

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:10%
and that was also started
by Maharishi 50 years ago,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:10%
is to do research, scientific,
publishable research,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:10%
on the effects of meditation,
firstly on health,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:10%
secondly on brain development.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And already that's
really important.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very lucky,
very honored,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
to be associated with
something called the David

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Lynch Foundation for
Consciousness-Based

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Education and World Peace.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:10%
In the purpose of
this foundation

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.290 align:middle line:10%
is to bring meditation to
every student in the world.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:10%
And right now in
the United States,

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:10%
there are about a
million children,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:10%
especially at-risk
children in public schools,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:10%
where those schools have adopted
transcendental meditation

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:10%
in the classroom to
develop the brains,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.090 align:middle line:10%
improve the health and behavior
of these million children.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And it is beginning to
transform education.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The results of this are
absolutely astonishing.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Can you measure it?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:10%
You can measure it in terms
of increased IQ, creativity,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:10%
learning ability, academic
performance, graduation rates,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:10%
reducing suspension
rates, improving behavior.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things are
very important to a school.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Academic performance and grades
are very important to a school.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The development of the
brain is very important,

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.700 align:middle line:84%
not just for students,
really, but for everybody.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So that can be accomplished
through meditation

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:90%
easily, automatically.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
things you can measure.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The other thing, of
course, the government

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
is very interested in?

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Heart disease and health.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:10%
One of the most
interesting studies,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:10%
probably the most important
study in the whole world

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:10%
of complementary medicine
and alternative medicine,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:10%
is the recent nine-year study,
released by the US National

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Institutes of Health, on
transcendental meditation

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and heart disease
and stroke and death,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:10%
finding that you can reduce
heart attack and stroke

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.870 align:middle line:10%
and death by all causes by
2/3 in a group that has,

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:10%
in addition to their
normal medications

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:10%
and normal diet and
normal exercise, also

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:10%
practices meditation.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%
2/3 is a major reduction.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So yes, in terms of the effects
on the body, the very deep

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
rest, the reduction of
stress, the elimination

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
of stress-related illness,
in terms of the development

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and mind and
creativity and intelligence,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:90%
all of that can be measured.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And finally, you can also
measure the effects on society

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:10%
from large groups of meditators.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And there, you simply measure
crime rate, social violence,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:90%
terrorism, war.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you can create a large
group, which isn't always

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
easy to do, in the
vicinity of conflict,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
like in the Middle East during
the peak of the Lebanon war,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
if you can produce a group
that's large enough, maybe

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
in that case 800 or
1,000 or 1,200 people,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
you can turn off war
like a light switch.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You can create a
calming influence

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and reduce the acute stress,
the religious tensions

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and political tensions and
the ethnic tensions that fuel

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
violence and fuel
conflict and see it

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of reduced war
deaths, war injuries,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and progress towards peace.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
measurable today.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And anything, honestly--
this is my bias

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:10%
as a scientist--
anything that is

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:06.640 align:middle line:10%
really true or worth anything
produces testable results.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And this whole tradition
of testing meditation

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
for its benefits
is relatively new,

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
important contribution

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of this scientific age,
which makes meditating today

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:90%
different from 2,000 years ago.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Because today, you can test
the effects of meditation

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and see what meditations are
working, what meditations

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%
maybe aren't working so much.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
to me, very important.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
What I'm really impressed
by is that it boots,

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
it gives a big boost, because
when you think of 2,000 people

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that could impact
that big a population,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:90%
it seems like it's super sized.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it has an extra power.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very
small group in the end

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:90%
compared to the population.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:90%
So how powerful is it?

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that means
that the power of unity

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:90%
is times-- I don't know.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a big factor.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This is really an
intelligent point.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You might wonder, well,
how can a group that

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
is so relatively small--
how could 2,000 people

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.369 align:middle line:90%
affect a million people?

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that thought
can be enormously powerful.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Thought can also be
exceedingly weak.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And destructive.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:90%
It can be destructive also.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So how do you create
powerful thought?

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Powerful thought simply means
deeper levels of thought,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
deeper levels of mind,
more fundamental levels

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
of human intelligence.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember, during the
meditation technique,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
the awareness, which is
normally outward and active and

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
turbulent and a bit
chaotic, honestly,

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the electrical
activity of the brain.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The brain's not really
talking to itself.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It's scattered.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:90%
It's fragmented.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But in the inward flow of the
awareness during the meditation

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
process, the whole brain
comes into a profound state

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:90%
of synchrony.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It's quite extraordinary to
see, unlike anything, not

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.485 align:middle line:84%
like hypnosis, not like
sleep, not like dreaming,

00:18:22.485 --> 00:18:24.890 align:middle line:90%
not like waking.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole brain
functions in concert,

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:90%
in a unified, powerful way.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And at those deeper levels of
mind where the brain is unified

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and functioning
coherently, then thought

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:90%
becomes enormously powerful.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's the
same principle in nature.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.355 align:middle line:90%
This is a physics principles.

00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called the uncertainty
principle of quantum mechanics,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
which basically says
the deeper you go,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
the more powerful
nature becomes.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever wondered
why nuclear power is

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
a million times more powerful
than chemical energy,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:90%
they're really very similar.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.670 align:middle line:84%
In chemical energy,
you're rearranging

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:90%
atoms into different molecules.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.650 align:middle line:84%
In nuclear power,
you rearranging

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
nucleons, protons and neutrons,
into different nuclei.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing,
but a million times

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
smaller and, therefore, a
million times more powerful.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the deeper you go,
the more powerful,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the more energetic nature
becomes, the more powerful

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
thoughts become.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So at these deepest
levels of mind

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.100 align:middle line:84%
experienced during meditation
and going beyond mind

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
completely to experience
our own core being,

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
these are the powerful
levels of thought.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And with this, with a
mustard seed of faith,

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:54.210 align:middle line:84%
the scriptures say,
you can move mountains.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And all the great
traditions understand

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:90%
the power of intention.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, it
can be exceedingly weak.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It just depends upon the level
at which we're thinking--

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
surface, chaotic, fractured
mind; deeper, more unified,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:90%
coherent mind.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So if a nuclear power is a
million times more powerful

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
than chemical energy, and if
the unified field, the level

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
of pure consciousness within us,
is 10 million million million

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
times more powerful even
than the nuclear force,

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine how powerful
thoughts can become.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:10%
So you must be quite
optimistic about the future and

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:10%
the evolution of human beings.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk
of 2012, of course,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure many people
ask you that question.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:90%
But how do you feel?

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Where do you feel human beings
are and how they're evolving?

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
I am very optimistic.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I did not used to be
terribly optimistic.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
But understanding now
and scientifically

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
confirming the power
of human consciousness

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and how easy it is to
culture that power-- even

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
at-risk children
from the age of 10

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:84%
can experience clear,
transcending, universal

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:90%
consciousness in minutes.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Or warriors coming back from the
battlefield with Post Traumatic

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Stress Disorder,
their lives ruined,

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:84%
their brains in a state
of permanent imbalance,

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and in 20 minutes,
even, that deep stress

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
can be completely unwound
through the deep, deep rest

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
and inner silence
of transcending,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
pure consciousness, samadhi.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Seeing the transformation that
is possible in the functioning

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of the brains of
anyone and everyone

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and seeing education,
public education,

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.800 align:middle line:84%
starting to absorb, to
adopt transcending as part

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:84%
of the academic structure, it's
only a matter of time, and not

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
too many years, before
our educational systems

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
are starting to unfold the
full potential of the brain

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and of life.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
when people start

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
using 100% of the potential
of life, of the brain,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and not 5% or 10%, we
will see a completely

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
transformed world,
easily in our lifetime,

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully quite soon.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Is this why you
went into politics?

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I know you were three times
candidate, the Natural

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Law Party up until 2000.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.824 align:middle line:84%
Is this part of your-- I mean,
you're doing so many things.

00:22:41.824 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I don't
know how you do them all,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:84%
but you were even
involved in politics.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of the things
that you wanted to implement?

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And what are some of the things
you think would really highly

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
contribute and some that
the president should

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:90%
incorporate in their program?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.097 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good point, Lilou.

00:22:58.097 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And I think you're right.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of getting
involved politically

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or becoming a
political activist was,

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of course, to promote change.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the United States,
we are locked into what is

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
called this two-party system.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the two parties are

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
so similar in some respects.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not really discussing
any fundamentally new approach.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're not talking
about the development

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:90%
of the human being.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking about the
development of consciousness.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They're not even talking about
the prevention of disease

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%
and the promotion of health.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They're only talking
about treating disease

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
through a medical system
that is very invasive, very

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:84%
expensive, and often
too late, you know,

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%
once the disease has begun.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So we started a
political party, which

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:90%
grew to be quite significant.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to promote
prevention-oriented solutions

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness-based
solutions,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
understanding that people
always act on the basis of who

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
they are, on the basis
of the development

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:90%
of their consciousness.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you can promote the
development of consciousness,

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
unfold the full human being,
develop the total brain,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:84%
in the schools, for
example, you can

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.890 align:middle line:84%
create an entirely different
society and an entirely

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:90%
different world.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of third
parties in the United States

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
is not actually to win,
although that would be nice.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't win, really.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
The finances and the system is
stacked so heavily against you.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of third
parties where they do succeed

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:48.200 align:middle line:84%
is in injecting new ideas into
the political dialogue, ideas

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that if they're timely
will take root and start

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:90%
to spread like a wildfire.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to really
disseminate some new ideas

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and to create some
really important

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
new solutions which
have never been

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:90%
discussed politically before.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.245 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason for
a political agitation,

00:25:05.245 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
a political activism.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
the solutions have

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:90%
to come from deeper than that.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Politics is a little bit
of a superficial approach.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
You really need to introduce
change from within.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Change always begins within.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's more the 97% of the
population that doesn't have

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
the supposedly authority
that could make

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.973 align:middle line:90%
a difference in this world?

00:25:33.973 --> 00:25:35.935 align:middle line:84%
-Exactly.
-Us.

00:25:35.935 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Us, yes, the
grassroots, so to speak,

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
the average person,
really all of us,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:90%
have to be part of the solution.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You could even elect, in
principle, an enlightened

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
government, and the
government would

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
be somewhat limited in
what it can really do.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
the government

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
can try to impose laws
and try to control

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
behavior from the outside in
through fear of punishment,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
But you know, fear of
punishment doesn't really work.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the United States
has the toughest penal code

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:90%
in the world, in a sense.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Capital punishment is used.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But it still has a very,
very high murder rate.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So the death penalty
doesn't even work.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Really, activity
comes from within.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And to change an individual
from within to take

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the light of life, the
light of consciousness,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:84%
the amount of
awareness or conscious

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
that we have, and
turn it up and up

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and up from inside like a
light bulb becoming brighter.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
That will lead to
more enlightened, more

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
luminous thinking and behavior.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have to start
with education.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Education should-- it's supposed
to-- develop human potential.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:90%
And today it really doesn't.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It provides some information,
some useful facts,

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:90%
some useful skills.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately, in
terms of developing

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:10%
the enormous potential
of life and of the brain,

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:10%
education completely
fails to do that.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's why fundamental
education reform is necessary.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean new classrooms.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean computers.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It means powerful,
natural techniques

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.910 align:middle line:90%
to develop the brain.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Even if those
techniques are ancient,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:84%
even if they may
come from the East,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean
they're religious.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Gravity was discovered
in England by Newton,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make gravity English.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Relativity was
discovered by a German.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Einstein doesn't make
relativity German.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Meditation was ultimately
derived and developed

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient
Vedic culture, and

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.370 align:middle line:84%
the whole system of
yoga, for example,

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it Indian.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's universal knowledge,
and we all need to use it.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Obviously you love children,
and you're passionate about it,

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and you see that they're a
big part of the solution.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:84%
How do we develop
as human beings?

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.640 align:middle line:90%
How does our brain evolve?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And when are these
principles especially

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:90%
important to teach to children?

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And even what should parents
teach to their own children

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and at what age?

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very
earlier on, isn't it?

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Before six years old,
or what are the--?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.095 align:middle line:84%
It's true, to some degree,
a lot of what we absorb

00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and what shapes us
is from our parents.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It's from a very early age.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I think really the best thing--
best thing-- a parent can do

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
is themselves to be happy
and balanced and evolving.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But by the age of 10, a
child can sit down and close

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the eyes, surprising as it
may be, within a few minutes,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
with proper guidance,
can experience

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
unbounded, universal, immortal
consciousness, just as you can,

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.030 align:middle line:90%
just as I can.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.740 align:middle line:90%
It's that natural.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And over the
centuries, meditation

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.860 align:middle line:84%
has become misunderstood,
difficult, complicated,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.710 align:middle line:84%
something for the
recluse, something

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.300 align:middle line:90%
you have to do for lifetimes.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It should not take lifetimes
to experience samadhi, not even

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.040 align:middle line:90%
hours-- minutes.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
question of technique.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And over the years, you can
trace it throughout history,

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you can watch what happened
with the concepts of meditation,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.120 align:middle line:84%
became complicated
and misunderstood.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Transcending is natural.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.150 align:middle line:90%
We're hardwired for it.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The brain is as if specifically
designed by someone,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:84%
something, designed to
transcend, to experience

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.340 align:middle line:90%
our universal nature.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we don't
access that capability.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:90%
We've got the hardware.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the software.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the training.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So the training just involves
quiet, personal instruction.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes about an
hour or so for about four days

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:12.560 align:middle line:84%
in a row to be sure one is
transcending effortlessly.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.765 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got it
for the rest of your life.

00:30:14.765 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you started
really early.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
How early?

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:90%
17 years old, yeah.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I just happened to
come across-- well,

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I was trying many things, I must
say, at that age, many things.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've since really
dappled and experimented

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.450 align:middle line:84%
with many, many
things and gained

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:84%
certain benefits from a
number of different things.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
life-changing for me,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and what is the most
fundamental experience,

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
really for anything, is going
beyond the whole mental circus,

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
going beyond thought
completely and experiencing

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:90%
our core being.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:84%
That is called
samadhi, transcending.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And that is the essence of it.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.910 align:middle line:84%
That's where development
really starts.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:84%
That's where the rapid
unfoldment of the brain begins.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's the experience that
needs to be given to children.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
have any belief.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.415 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
to have any dogma.

00:31:13.415 --> 00:31:14.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not an intellectual thing.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not visualizing.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not contemplating.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not dispassionate
self-reflection.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:90%
All of that has to do with mind.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:30.201 align:middle line:84%
It's going, slipping
beyond mind to being.

00:31:30.201 --> 00:31:34.550 align:middle line:84%
In that space, when
you say transcendent,

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
does it transcend also
the limiting belief

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and what we have in store
in the unconscious mind?

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely transcends mind,
belief, sensation, feeling,

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:90%
intellect, ego-- everything.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a radically
different experience--

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
radically different experience--
from anything we experience

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:90%
in waking consciousness.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like day and night.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the brain,
the brain is normally

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
quite chaotic, and this part
of the brain is doing this,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:90%
this part is doing this.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:84%
There's not much integration,
coordination, communication.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
In the state of unbounded
awareness, transcending,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:84%
the entire brain is
absolutely synchronous.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The awareness
expands to infinity,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:90%
immortality, beyond time.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:90%
It is unmistakable.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:35.080 align:middle line:84%
That experience is as simple,
as natural, and more important,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I think, than any
experience we normally have.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:90%
We're all designed to have it.

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And the tragedy
of education today

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:90%
is that it doesn't give it.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, with David
Lynch, the filmmaker,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
founded the David
Lynch Foundation

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to bring that experience
to everyone in the world.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's easy to do.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.390 align:middle line:10%
And also through
movies, I guess,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:10%
that you have put
together with him

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:10%
to be able to see it and witness
it and even experience it

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.685 align:middle line:10%
without having maybe the tools?

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting point.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
There have been some
films about meditation,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:84%
films like "The Secret,"
films like "What the Bleep."

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I've
been in those films.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But David himself
hasn't really made films

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:84%
about the transcendent,
interestingly, even though he

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
himself is a very deep,
regular meditator.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:84%
For him, his joy
of filmmaking is

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:84%
different-- a little bizarre,
but also very fascinating.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
He's a creative artist,
absolutely the real thing.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:43.010 align:middle line:84%
He's an incredible,
creative artist.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But his interest in
the transcendent,

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:84%
he hasn't yet used film to
kind of expose or reveal that.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Maybe someday he will.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So his work with his foundation
is really to bring the funding

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:84%
so that schools can actually
hire the type of education

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.260 align:middle line:84%
of transcendental
meditation instructor

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.520 align:middle line:84%
that can easily give that
experience to all the children.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things I've been

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:90%
very happy to be involved with.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:84%
Tell us on the neuroscience
level and the neuroplasticity,

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.949 align:middle line:84%
how does that rewire
even our brains?

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:21.706 align:middle line:90%
That is a really good question.

00:34:21.706 --> 00:34:26.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, experience, any
experience, changes the brain.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:31.199 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are amazingly
flexible and changeable,

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%
incredibly plastic.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.510 align:middle line:84%
We're always forging
new connections,

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:90%
creating new neural pathways.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
any new experience,

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:42.650 align:middle line:84%
any fundamental experience
like transcending,

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is going to start
to rewire the brain.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, during transcending,
two things happen.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, the higher brain,
the prefrontal cortex,

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.690 align:middle line:84%
the executive
center of the brain,

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.670 align:middle line:90%
gets directly stimulated.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It lights up.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's important,
because the higher brain

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
is responsible for all of
our higher human functions,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:84%
moral reasoning,
judgment, planning,

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
decision making, all of that.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It sits over the primitive
brain and maintains control.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It's our rational filter
against primitive, impulsive,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.330 align:middle line:90%
aggressive, violent behavior.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But under stress, the
prefrontal cortex shuts down.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Under chronic stress, which
pervades the world today,

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.050 align:middle line:84%
the higher brain shuts
down chronically and even

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:90%
fails to develop properly.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.580 align:middle line:10%
So we end up in a world, living
in a world where so many people

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.720 align:middle line:10%
are walking around with an
underdeveloped higher brain,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.140 align:middle line:10%
kind of an adolescent world.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at the television

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
or what's going on
the news, you'll

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.810 align:middle line:84%
agree that we're living very
much in an adolescent world

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:84%
of aggression and impulsive
behavior, violence

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and nationalism and
narrow-minded, self centered

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.630 align:middle line:90%
shortsightedness and so on.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So we need to develop
the higher brain.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, transcending
lights up the higher brain.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, it
integrates the higher brain

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the brain
so that the higher brain

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:84%
can do its job, which is
to control the entire brain

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:90%
so we're not driven by impulse.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We're not driven by
primitive impulses.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.750 align:middle line:84%
We're driven by our loftiest,
highest aspirations.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, it completely
rewires the brain,

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.000 align:middle line:84%
not just during meditation,
which you see it so striking.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to
see the difference

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.310 align:middle line:84%
between the meditating
brain, the EEG

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of the meditating brain, and
the EEG of the waking brain.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But over time, that
orderly brain functioning,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:84%
synchronous brain functioning,
coherent brain functioning,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:90%
becomes permanent.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And when it becomes permanent,
it is called enlightenment.

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And enlightenment is
really, fundamentally just

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.350 align:middle line:84%
as a definition, it's when
our unbounded, immortal, inner

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
self, when our own pure
consciousness becomes

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:21.230 align:middle line:84%
permanently established so
that in dynamic activity, even

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
during deep sleep,
we are never lost

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to the experience of our
unbounded, immortal, blissful

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
It's permanent samadhi in the
midst of dynamic activity.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.990 align:middle line:90%
That's proper brain functioning.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how our brains
were designed to work.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But it just takes--
like speech is natural.

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to talk.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a little
bit of instruction.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
If a child is
abandoned in the woods

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and is lucky enough to
survive as an infant,

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.640 align:middle line:90%
they don't learn to speak.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural, but it takes
a little bit of training.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Transcending and the
development of enlightenment

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:90%
is equally natural.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a built-in,
innate capability

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:90%
of the human nervous system.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a few minutes
of training, that's all.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It feels that when
we're doing something

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that we love in light--
in life-- in light,

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:19.400 align:middle line:84%
in life, whether
it is gardening,

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:84%
or like for me interviewing,
or for a writer to write,

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.900 align:middle line:84%
there is this natural
connection that occurs.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And it nearly feels like
it's a meditative state,

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's a blissful way.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.820 align:middle line:84%
To me, if more people
would do what they love,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.130 align:middle line:84%
then this Earth will be
a lot more harmonious.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that through
your own research

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:84%
how important and essential
this is for our society

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.000 align:middle line:90%
to be living on that level?

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is important to be
living what one loves to do.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
that's not a luxury

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:90%
many people feel they have.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:54.720 align:middle line:90%
They have to work.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They have to grind
out their jobs.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They have to earn a living.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:01.815 align:middle line:84%
But it is much healthier,
much more evolutionary,

00:39:01.815 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and brings more
happiness to be doing

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:05.900 align:middle line:90%
what you like to be doing.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And for the fortunate few who
get to work professionally

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:84%
doing what they
like to be doing,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:84%
like you with this type of
work, that's really fortunate.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very good thing.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And other key thing is, by
establishing inner bliss,

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
one brings more bliss to
whatever one does so that one

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.400 align:middle line:90%
finds, I even like my job.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I even like teaching
university kids.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You just-- there's
more joy in everything.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:90%
It's unlimited, yeah.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.860 align:middle line:90%
There is even more and deeper.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.301 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we get satisfied
with what we have, don't we?

00:39:44.301 --> 00:39:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's true.
We can become too content.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.520 align:middle line:84%
We can become too content,
and we don't always

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
seek that which is
even more blissful,

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.810 align:middle line:90%
more joyful, more evolutionary.

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Usually in society we say,
oh, you're never satisfied.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
You're always looking
for more and more.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:90%
But we can, can't we?

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:10%
It seems like that we need
to be rewired and rethink

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.141 align:middle line:10%
and live in a whole-- we can
live in a whole new world

00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.207 align:middle line:10%
right now.
We don't need to wait.

00:40:13.207 --> 00:40:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know,
it's interesting,

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:19.010 align:middle line:84%
because this tendency
to want more and more

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:84%
and seek more happiness, it's
actually a very good thing.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It is deep in the
nature of life to want

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to grow and expand,
gain more knowledge,

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:90%
more happiness, more power.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It's built into
the nature of life,

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's good
because, it drives us

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:90%
to seek more and more and more.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And the only lasting happiness--
because no matter what you get,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.630 align:middle line:84%
if you get a new
Cadillac, you soon

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.400 align:middle line:84%
discover you want
a Mercedes, or you

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
soon discover you
want a Lamborghini,

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and it never stops.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But infinity-- infinity-- if
it could be lived in life,

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
would be the natural
state of contentment.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.550 align:middle line:84%
If it were possible to
experience a joy beyond which

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.860 align:middle line:84%
no further joy could
even be imagined,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that would be the
natural state of life.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Then contentment
would be permanent.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But you know, that's
what enlightenment is.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
It's experiencing absolute,
infinite joy all the time.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
state of life.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's that very drive
towards happiness which

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.920 align:middle line:84%
makes meditation effortless,
because meditation, again,

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.780 align:middle line:84%
properly understood
and practiced,

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.000 align:middle line:84%
involves typically
what's called a sound,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or mantra with a-- it's a sound
with a very special property.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:84%
There are different
types of mantras,

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
but a transcending mantra, to
take you to the transcendent,

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.050 align:middle line:90%
has a special property.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:84%
It is a sound that
is experienced

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:03.960 align:middle line:84%
as more charming, more
enticing, more alluring, more

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.750 align:middle line:84%
blissful at deeper and
deeper and deeper and deeper

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.520 align:middle line:90%
levels of thought.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When the mind catches
a glimpse of the fact

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that there's more
happiness experiencing

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.560 align:middle line:84%
a sound deeper and
deeper and deeper level,

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:90%
the mind just goes with it.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's absorbed in it.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It just is attracted.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It gets drawn to
the transcendent,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.120 align:middle line:90%
which is absolute joy.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So that tendency of life
to want more happiness

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:39.340 align:middle line:84%
can be used as the
mechanics of transcending.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.130 align:middle line:90%
And that is the classic trick.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a thousands-year-old trick
to take our normally outwardly

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:84%
directed attention, deeply,
naturally, spontaneously

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:84%
within, to experience greater
and greater and greater

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.160 align:middle line:84%
happiness, and ultimately
the ultimate happiness.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit of
training involved.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.700 align:middle line:84%
What sound has that
quality for you?

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And then how do
you use that sound

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:84%
in a proper and
effortless, natural way,

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.900 align:middle line:84%
which won't prevent
the transcending

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.020 align:middle line:90%
from naturally occurring?

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's all meditation is.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:90%
It's two things.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a proper sound and the
technique to use it properly.

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to
learn, but to teach it

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.470 align:middle line:90%
takes a little bit of training.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Like you'd get a master's
degree in teaching transcending.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are
thousands of teachers

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:90%
who have that training.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:90%
And that takes a little time.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.490 align:middle line:90%
But learning is simple.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And again, it
works for children,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and it works for elderly
people who are in nursing homes

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and care facilities to increase
their alertness, intelligence,

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.410 align:middle line:84%
happiness, creativity,
memory, health.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So for people of
all ages, there's

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing I think as
fundamental or as important

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
as transcending.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.050 align:middle line:10%
Well, it becomes,
then, not the ratio,

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:07.880 align:middle line:10%
but how active we are, then,
in life, how efficient we are

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.530 align:middle line:10%
and how we put the
actions and the things

00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:10%
that we have in our brain, you
know, how we manifest, too.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how does that
concretely show up in life?

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:84%
The effects of transcending
show up everywhere.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Transcending is a
holistic experience.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole brain is
engaged and nourished.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And that means the
parts of our brain

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.100 align:middle line:84%
that are involved with
nurturing children,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the parts of the brain that are
involved with deductive logic,

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.500 align:middle line:84%
the parts of the brain
that are involved

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:84%
with perception, speech,
action, athletics-- everything.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So transcending
is the one thing,

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd say the only thing,
that is completely holistic,

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
engages and develops
the total brain,

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and develops life holistically.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So if one was to be a better
mother, better doctor, better

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.600 align:middle line:84%
athlete, better business
person, better artist,

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:84%
this is the one thing that
will really unfold life fully.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.700 align:middle line:10%
When you explain that
to your colleagues

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.550 align:middle line:10%
that you studied with at
Harvard and Stanford and all

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.910 align:middle line:10%
those universities and are
probably also brilliant minds

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:25.020 align:middle line:10%
but that see you talking about
TM, Transcendental Meditation,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.770 align:middle line:10%
that is, and how do they react?

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And do they maybe
think, oh, he lost it,

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and we don't understand why, but
he still has this great mind?

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:35.643 align:middle line:84%
And how does this
all--? [LAUGHS]

00:45:35.643 --> 00:45:37.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
is so different.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.310 align:middle line:84%
People are so
different, you know?

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about
a physical scientist

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:47.450 align:middle line:84%
or an engineer, these folks
are not always the folks

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that are interested
in consciousness

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.760 align:middle line:90%
or pay any attention to it.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.270 align:middle line:84%
They will say, well,
as long as Hagelin

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is publishing good papers,
then, you know, that's fine.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.150 align:middle line:84%
If he wants to talk
about consciousness,

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.770 align:middle line:90%
well, you know, that's fine.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.230 align:middle line:90%
That's his business.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody
understands it, of course.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.876 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'd
have to say, you

00:46:06.876 --> 00:46:12.600 align:middle line:84%
know, to really understand it
takes some degree of experience

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.820 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about group
meditation, for example,

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:20.840 align:middle line:84%
reducing crime, preventing
war, reducing social stress

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.440 align:middle line:84%
and promoting social harmony,
that's hard for many people.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It's hard for a physical
scientist to understand.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I think for many physical
scientists, consciousness

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:37.180 align:middle line:84%
either doesn't exist, or it's
some superficial byproduct

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.200 align:middle line:84%
of the electrochemical
processes of the brain,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.480 align:middle line:90%
something superficial.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.170 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
here is consciousness

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:50.160 align:middle line:84%
as fundamental, consciousness
as the unified field.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, physicists who are really
active in the field, they

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.270 align:middle line:84%
accept the unified field,
the fundamental unity,

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the basis of the surface
diversity of the world.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.710 align:middle line:84%
If you ask them, is
that fundamental unity

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
of life consciousness?

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:90%
they'd say, what?

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so, but,
honestly, I've never

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.820 align:middle line:90%
thought about consciousness.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Those few physicists who do
think about consciousness,

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.420 align:middle line:84%
including some at the
conference in Doorn here,

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.610 align:middle line:84%
like Menas Kafatos,
they understand

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that the unified field
is consciousness.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, most physicists
don't think about it.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.120 align:middle line:90%
It's not their business.

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.330 align:middle line:84%
They're not into the
business of consciousness.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Leave that to the psychiatrists
and psychologists.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They're into the
business of physics,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and they don't yet
see the unity of the

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.290 align:middle line:90%
objective and subjective world.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
relatively few people

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.220 align:middle line:84%
in the world who are experts
in unified field theory.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.790 align:middle line:84%
There are relatively few experts
in the world who are experts

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.540 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness and
unfortunately, very few people

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.200 align:middle line:84%
in the world who are really
experts in both and that

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.220 align:middle line:84%
are capable of creating
the connections

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.810 align:middle line:84%
between deep consciousness
and deep physics.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fun,
fascinating, wonderful world

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.660 align:middle line:90%
in which to play.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are very few
people to play with.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Mhm, mhm.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.515 align:middle line:10%
Well, we can definitely
feel through this interview

00:48:16.515 --> 00:48:18.690 align:middle line:10%
that you have those both sides.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And would you attribute
that to the meditation,

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that it has developed
each of the side together?

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.270 align:middle line:90%
And are those now linked?

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.840 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is
certainly true for me

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that my meditation
has really enhanced

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.660 align:middle line:90%
my ability to do physics.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I started to meditate at
the same time I was starting

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.780 align:middle line:84%
to learn quantum mechanics, and
I was finding quantum mechanics

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.510 align:middle line:84%
very abstract and really
very difficult and dry,

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:48.820 align:middle line:90%
dry meaning kind of boring.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, after
meditation, it's like, wow,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.170 align:middle line:84%
these ideas are just
lucid and exciting

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:90%
and profound and wonderful.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So it really
awakened my interest

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.390 align:middle line:90%
and ability to do physics.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And other meditating
scientists will

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.080 align:middle line:90%
say exactly the same thing.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think for me, meditation
was very important to develop

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.530 align:middle line:90%
as a physicist.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
One of my award-winning series,
the so-called Supersymmetric

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Flipped SU(5) Grand
Unified Field Theory,

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.630 align:middle line:84%
was completely
derived in meditation.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's been an
important tool for me.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
that truth is one

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and that if physics brings
truth, which it does--

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:39.040 align:middle line:84%
it's reliable; it's
testable; it's true--

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and if the deep spiritual,
even religious, traditions

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
of the world bring truth, and
they do, or they wouldn't have

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.190 align:middle line:84%
survived for millennia as a
useful, true guide to life,

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
then those two truths
must be linked.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Because there ultimately
is only one truth.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And where those two
truths come together,

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:84%
the truth of the subjective
world and the truth

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:07.870 align:middle line:84%
of the objective world
of modern science,

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.280 align:middle line:84%
is at the level of
the unified field.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
pure consciousness

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and pure existence,
the source of thought

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and the source of the
objective world, come together.

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:27.500 align:middle line:84%
There's an old saying,
atman is Brahman.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Brahman is the
fundamental unity of life.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Atman is our
consciousness, the self.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:38.250 align:middle line:84%
That self, pure consciousness,
the meditative state, samadhi,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:45.601 align:middle line:84%
is Brahman, is the experience
of the universal truth of unity.

00:50:45.601 --> 00:50:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, John, so
much for this moment

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and for this interview.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward to
seeing you and hearing

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:54.550 align:middle line:84%
you speak at the
conference here in Holland.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.
